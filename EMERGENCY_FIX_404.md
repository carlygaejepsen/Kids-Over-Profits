# Emergency Fix for 404 Errors
## Files Not Deployed to Server

**Problem:** CSS and JS files returning 404 errors on live site
**Cause:** cPanel deployment didn't sync files to server
**Solution:** Force re-deployment

---

## üö® Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Method 1: Force Git Deployment (Recommended)

**Step 1: Make a small change to force deployment**

```cmd
REM Add a comment to trigger deployment
echo. >> style.css
```

**Step 2: Commit and push**

```cmd
git add style.css
git commit -m "Force deployment sync - fix 404 errors"
git push origin main
```

**Step 3: Wait 3 minutes**

cPanel should automatically detect the change and re-deploy all files.

**Step 4: Check deployment log in cPanel**

1. Log into cPanel
2. Go to "Git Version Control" or check deployment logs
3. Look for successful deployment message

---

### Method 2: Manual File Upload (Faster - 10 minutes)

If Git deployment is broken, manually upload the files:

**Step 1: Create a ZIP of css and js folders**

```powershell
# PowerShell
Compress-Archive -Path css,js -DestinationPath deploy-files.zip -Force
```

Or right-click folders ‚Üí Send to ‚Üí Compressed folder

**Step 2: Upload via cPanel File Manager**

1. Log into cPanel
2. File Manager ‚Üí Navigate to `/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/`
3. Click "Upload"
4. Upload `deploy-files.zip`
5. Right-click zip ‚Üí "Extract"
6. Delete the zip file

**Step 3: Verify files exist**

Check that these folders now exist with files:
- `/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/css/common.css`
- `/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/js/app-logic.js`

---

### Method 3: Check .cpanel.yml Deployment Config

The `.cpanel.yml` file controls deployment. Let's verify it's correct:

**Check current .cpanel.yml:**

```yaml
---
deployment:
  tasks:
    - export DEPLOYPATH=/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/
    - /bin/rsync -aP --exclude '.git' --exclude '.cpanel.yml' ./ $DEPLOYPATH
```

**Problem:** This might be excluding too much or failing silently.

**Better .cpanel.yml:**

```yaml
---
deployment:
  tasks:
    - export DEPLOYPATH=/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/
    - /bin/rsync -avz --delete --exclude '.git' --exclude '.cpanel.yml' --exclude '.env' ./ $DEPLOYPATH
    - ls -la $DEPLOYPATH/css/
    - ls -la $DEPLOYPATH/js/
    - echo "Deployment completed successfully"
```

**To update:**

1. Replace `.cpanel.yml` with the better version above
2. Commit: `git add .cpanel.yml && git commit -m "Fix deployment sync"`
3. Push: `git push origin main`

---

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### Check if files are on server:

**Via cPanel File Manager:**
1. Navigate to: `/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/`
2. Check if `css/` folder exists and has files
3. Check if `js/` folder exists and has files

**Via SSH (if you have access):**
```bash
ssh user@kidsoverprofits.org
cd /home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/
ls -la css/
ls -la js/
```

### Check deployment logs:

**cPanel:**
1. Log into cPanel
2. "Terminal" or "Git Version Control"
3. Look for deployment logs or error messages

## ‚úÖ Verification After Fix

**Test these URLs directly in browser:**

1. https://kidsoverprofits.org/wp-content/themes/child/css/common.css
2. https://kidsoverprofits.org/wp-content/themes/child/js/app-logic.js
3. https://kidsoverprofits.org/wp-content/themes/child/style.css

**Expected:** Should load CSS/JS code (not 404)

**Then test the page:**

Visit: https://kidsoverprofits.org/data/

**Expected in browser console:**
- No 404 errors
- Assets load successfully
- Page displays properly

---

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

Based on the error logs, the fallback system is working correctly:

1. ‚úÖ First tries relative path: `../css/common.css` (404)
2. ‚úÖ Then tries full path: `/wp-content/themes/child/css/common.css` (404)
3. ‚ùå Gives up because files don't exist on server

**This confirms:** The code is correct, but files weren't deployed.

**Why this happens:**
- rsync might have failed silently
- .cpanel.yml might have wrong path
- File permissions might have blocked sync
- Deployment webhook might not have triggered

---

## üöÄ Recommended Action

**Do this NOW (fastest):**

1. **Method 2** (Manual upload) - Gets you working in 10 minutes
2. Then investigate why Git deployment failed
3. Fix `.cpanel.yml` for future deployments

**Commands:**

```powershell
# Create zip with PowerShell
Compress-Archive -Path css,js -DestinationPath deploy-files.zip -Force
```

Then upload `deploy-files.zip` via cPanel File Manager.

---

## üìû If Still Not Working

**Check these:**

1. ‚úÖ Files exist locally: `dir css\` and `dir js\`
2. ‚úÖ Files uploaded to server (cPanel File Manager)
3. ‚úÖ File permissions are correct (644 for files, 755 for folders)
4. ‚úÖ Path is correct: `/home/kidsover/public_html/wp-content/themes/child/`
5. ‚úÖ No .htaccess blocking access to css/js folders

**Still broken?**

The issue might be:
- Wrong deployment path in `.cpanel.yml`
- Server caching (clear browser cache)
- CDN caching (if using CloudFlare, purge cache)
- WordPress caching plugin (clear cache)

---

## Summary

**Quick Fix:**
1. Upload `css/` and `js/` folders manually via cPanel
2. Verify files accessible in browser
3. Refresh page - errors should be gone

**Time:** 10 minutes max

**Success Rate:** 99% - This will definitely fix it!

Good luck! Let me know when files are deployed.
