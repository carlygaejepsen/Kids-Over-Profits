    "narrative": "On 07/25/2021, the Department received a complaint alleging that a client is being hit by another resident in care while under the care and supervision of staff workers. The focused client (FC) who was identified in the referral provided inconsistent information. The focused client (FC) denied the allegation and stated that the conversation he had with an individual identified as other was not accurate information and stated \"it's not really like that\". The focused client admitted that he reported that he was being hit by another peer and that the staff present was not responding accordingly, however, the FC said it was not true. The FC stated that staff working is always present and is quick to intervene when clients are out of line. The FC identified another client that was bothering him by being hit and stated that it was not true. The focused client (FC) admitted that he likes to horseplay with others and stated that everything is fine and that he feels safe living at the facility. Staff workers who were interviewed denied the allegation that they are allowing a client to bother or harass another resident (peers). Staff workers were in agreement that the focused client (FC) is the one who is actually horse-playing around with other clients. Five of the six clients provided consistent information in confidential interviews and denied the allegation. One client who was identified as hitting the focused client categorically denied the allegation and stated \"it's the other way around\". All clients reported that staff at the facility are always present and had no concerns or complaints overall about the operations at the facility. The individual identified as other who reportedly had direct information about the allegation could not be contacted after several attempts to speak with other by telephone went unanswered. Statements obtained could not corroborate the allegation reported for neglect/lack of supervision by staff working at the facility. Therefore, the above allegation is determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the facility representative for review and signature. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

It was also alleged that the STRTP staff did not report missing client. Based on review of the client's clothing inventory and statements obtained during interviews, client had several pair of well fitting shoes as well as the boots he was wearing the day of 04/22/24, which belonged to him and fit him well when purchased. Client enjoyed wearing his boots and never informed facility that they did not fit him. Client chose to wear that pair of boots when he left the home without authorization. Same interviews revealed that as client had been consistently leaving the facility in unauthorized fashion upon return, the local Police Department had been leaving an earlier law enforcement report as an open report, therefore, filing another missing person's report is unnecessary at times. Confidential statements obtained during the investigation were unable to corroborate the allegations, revealing inconsistencies. Social worker interviewed by LPA had no concerns regarding the allegations. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. No deficiencies were cited at this time. Exit interview conducted. A signed copy of this report, LIC9099-C, and LIC811 were provided to Vickie Valadez, Office Manager. Appeal rights provided.",

Multiple staff interviews admitted that that the family visits for the client were not happening, but it was due to either the client or the family member declining the visits. Staff testimony stated that family visits were always offered, but they did need to adhere to court mandated monitored visits, and the client or the family member had some refusals in the beginning. The client interview shared that they did not know why visits did not happen in the beginning but admitted that they are taking place now. LPA preformed a records review shows notes from the Intensive Care Coordinator (ICC) who recorded all the offered/set up visits that were declined by the client or the family. Due to conflicting testimonial evidence and the visitation notes, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met, therefore, the allegation of the \u201cStaff have not properly facilitated family visits\u201d has been found to be unsubstantiated. LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A client interview shared that a staff member would at times \u201cget frustrated and leave shift early\u201d causing supervision and staff-to-client ratio issues. Multiple staff interviews stated that staff never left their shift early and never caused care and supervision issues.

All staff and most client testimonies state that the facility does offer consistent medical care in a timely manner when requested. Staff interviews also clarified how some situations may appear to be neglecting medical concerns but are actually following facility policies. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff does not seek medical attention to minors in a timely manner\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \u201cMinor has access to marijuana while in care.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. Witness and client interviews stated that certain clients would smoke marijuana and abuse substances in the facility.

LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding minors having access to marijuana while in care. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cMinor has access to marijuana while in care\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated.\n\nAllegations: \u201cStaff are not meeting minor's mental health needs.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that a client was struggling with suicide and was not helped by the facility.

Staff interviews explain that while clients often refuse to engage or participate in the clinical services they are still always offered. Staff interviews claimed that no client has ever reported struggling with suicide. Client testimonies confirmed that mental health assistance is offered, but not always accepted by clients. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the mental health services being provided by the facility. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff are not meeting minor's mental health needs\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \u201cStaff does not accord minor privacy.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that a client was not being afforded privacy by the facility and would lock themselves in the bathroom to obtain privacy. Staff interviews shared that clients are always afforded privacy, around the facility, and especially in their bedrooms. Client interviews also stated that the facility offered privacy, and clients never had to lock themselves away to get privacy. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding privacy in the facility. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff does not accord minor privacy\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \u201cStaff does not allow minor phone calls.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that clients were not allowed to make phone calls freely. Staff interviews shared that clients have access to the facility phone and can make calls freely whenever they want. Staff shared that the only call restrictions were court-ordered restrictions. LPA observed the landline at the facility. Client testimony stated that clients had access to the facility phone at all times, and most clients had their own phones and were able to make calls freely.\n\nLPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the public phone policy for the facility. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff does not allow minor phone calls\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \u201cStaff does not prevent other minors from being bullied.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview stated that younger clients often get bullied by older clients. Staff interviews shared that some older clients did pick on and tease younger clients, but the younger clients would also tease and agitate the older clients to get them in trouble. Staff would always intervene and discourage any bullying from any clients. Client interviews stated that there was some bullying happening at the facility. Clients stated that sometimes staff would intervene when it was happening in public, but sometimes they would not follow up on bullying complaints. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding bullying in the facility. No other evidence besides testimonies were provided by any interviewed parties. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff does not prevent other minors from being bullied\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \u201cStaff does not ensure minor is provided adequate clothing.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that a client was not adequately clothed, often walking around without shoes and with shirts with holes in them. Staff interviews stated that clients are always informed and offered to go clothes shopping using the facility budget for new clothes. Staff interviews shared that sometimes clients are comfortable with their current clothes, don\u2019t like change, and don\u2019t care enough to go shopping for new clothes. Client interviews shared that they were adequately clothed and always provided the opportunity to get new clothes. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding clients being adequately clothed. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff does not ensure minor is provided adequate clothing\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated.\n\nAllegations: \u201cStaff does not follow facility's activity calendar.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview shared that the staff do not update or follow the facility activity calendar. Staff interviews stated that the facility calendar is updated monthly with the participation of the clients. Staff shared that sometimes the activity schedule is not followed only because the clients refuse or deny the scheduled outings and activities. Staff said that it is common for clients on one day to agree to do an activity and then on the next day refuse, which results in the activity or outing being canceled. LPA observed the activity schedule posted in the facility with the correct dates. Client testimonies confirm that the activity schedule is accurate and updated often, but that clients can and often decline to participate in the activities. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the facility's activity schedule. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cStaff does not follow facility's activity calendar\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \u201cFacility is operating out of ratio.\u201d During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview stated that the facility often operated out of ration with only 1 staff for every 4/5 clients. The witness claimed that this ratio would last for entire shifts and that it wasn\u2019t uncommon. Client testimonies confirmed that the facility sometimes operated with only one direct care staff. Clients also claimed that it wasn\u2019t unusual and would last for long periods of time, not just in between shifts. Staff interviews said that the facility never operates out of ratio. Staff interviews state that other staff, including the clinical team, facility managers, and even the administrator, will step in to provide extra coverage when necessary. Sometimes coverage is needed between swing shifts if a staff member is running late, but this is extremely rare. LPA observed the LIC 500 staff roster and schedule and observed adequate 24-hour. coverage. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the facility operation out of ratio. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \u201cFacility is operating out of ratio\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, during which LPA provided the Administrator with a copy of this report and a copy of their appeal rights.",

LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. Staff interviews stated that the facilities policy is to provide \u201ca minimum of two hours per week of group therapy and one and a half hour of individual therapy\u201d. Multiple staff and client interviews reported that these group and individual therapy sessions are being provided and are in line with facility policy. Multiple clients shared that though the sessions are offered, they often either decline or don\u2019t actively speak and participate in the sessions, making them shorter. All staff and clients stated that therapy sessions are offered on a weekly basis. One staff interview stated that \u201cSTRTP regulations require an on site therapist from 9-5\u2026 (the facility) has not been providing 9-5 coverage.\u201d LPA researched both the STRTP regulations and the facility program statement and could not find any minimum time requirement for a therapist to be present, only that therapy sessions are required to be offered.",

During investigation, shift notes and incident reports reveal that staff found alcohol and weed during a room search in C1\u2019s (See LIC 811, dated 7/15/22) room. When staff found the empty alcohol bottle, staff notified Administrator, authorized representatives, and sent an incident report to CCL. When staff conduct room searches, staff ensures there are two staff present. When finding contraband, staff remove the contraband and discard it. A staff member checks in with the client and reminds them that the facility is a drug free zone and not allowed. All parties denied seeing C1 drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in the facility. When interviewing clients and staff, everyone stated that there was enough food and that the facility always maintained their client to staff ratio. LPA Ng reviewed shift notes and confirmed that staff are providing adequate supervision to clients in care. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence that Minor is drinking alcohol while in care, Minor is smoking marijuana while in care, Facility does not have an adequate amount of food supplies, Meals are not being prepared for minors in care, Minor(s) not being properly supervised while in care, therefore the above allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Regarding the allegation of staff was not responsive to minor\u2019s medical concerns: LPA conducted confidential interviews. C1 stated that the facility was meeting all her medical needs and she felt happy with services provided. During confidential interviews with staff, staff 1 states the C1 always has headaches, and declines medical help when offered. Another interview disclosed that other direct care workers do not fulfill the needs of clients. LPA conducted document research in shift notes and found no evidence of staff being unresponsive to C1\u2019s medical concerns. C1\u2019s initial needs and service plan states that C1 is refusing to take all medications. An incident report dated 9-6-22 states that C1 did not go to school because she was not feeling well and refused medical attention when offered. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that staff was not responsive to minor\u2019s medical concern. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. Regarding the allegation of facility not providing a safe environment for minor: LPA conducted confidential interviews with staff and clients. C1 stated that she feels safe and that all her needs are being met by the facility. Based on confidential interviews it was disclosed that staff pick and choose their favorite clients and that other clients try to trigger other clients off. In addition, it was stated that some direct care workers take long breaks, not supervising clients as closely as they should. LPA conducted document research and found no evidence of unsafe conditions for minors. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that facility does not provide a safe environment for minor. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "brandished a knife at school, not consistently going to school, AWOLS, damaging the facility van door. and failure to improve behavior. CQ was informed of the 14-day notice verbally on 4/25/22. LPA looked up the facility incident report (IR) archive and found the knife incident which occurred on 11/27/21, three IRs for missing school (on 5/2/22, 5/3/22, and 5/4/22 which was after 14-day notice), one AWOL (4/23/22), and the van incident (4/27/22, which was two days after verbal 14-day notice). CQ stated they were told on 4/25/22 that they were given a 14-day notice for missing school and AWOLs. CQ stated they were discriminated against because other clients AWOLed, missed school, and do worse things. CQ said stated that they missed some school and got kicked out at their previous school but had been consistently attending their current school. They stated they only missed school this week (the week starting on 4/25/22) due to having a sore throat and not feeling well. Most individuals interviewed said that other clients were also missing school, AWOLing, with some doing worse/more dangerous things than CQs but did not get 14-day notice. When LPA inquired about the knife incident, CQ stated that they brought the knife to school because they felt threaten by another student and needed it for self-defense. When LPA inquired about the van door incident, CQ stated that it was an accident. They said that the Van door was previously broken and hard to close. When they attempted to close it the first time it did not close, so they closed the door with more force to close it which result in the door flying off the hinge and breaking a window. Most individuals interviewed stated that they knew or heard the van door was broken before that incident. LPA asked individuals interviewed if IUM has ever made them sign a training sheet without receiving training. Most answered not remember ever signing a training sheet, with one individual stating if their name was on a training sheet (it was on the sheet) it was forged and another admitting upper management asked them to create fake training sheets and to fill out the signatures. When LPA inquired about training provided by upper management most individuals stated that it was inadequate. LPA requested and received training material for IRs and trauma informed care (TIC). For IR training the facility sent staff training sign in sheet and a Word document that had reporting requirements regulations copied onto it. For TIC the facility sent a one page flyer that gives a brief general explanation of trauma informed care, unsigned LIC 613B (which lists personal rights), and a staff training sign in sheet. The sheet indicated that one of the trainers was upper management and was qualified to conduct this training since they were STRTP Administrator certified (this is not a qualification to be a trainer of TIC). Facility also stated that TIC training included a 30 minute video but didn't list the title so there was no way for LPA to verify the video. Facility did not provide LPA with certification of TIC for staff.\n\nLPA asked individuals if there were some staff that could not do the basic duties of the job. Individuals stated at least one or more could not or would not do basic job duties. Some examples given are not providing food and not picking up medicine for clients. Not preforming room checks, watching tv, doing personal Laundry, washing personal car, and falling sleep while on duty allowing clients to AWOL unnoticed. These examples indicate that some staff members did not provide adequate care and supervision. Most individuals indicated that management was aware of this. Based on LPA interviews and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the list above allegations, are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. As a result of this visit, there is three General Licensing Standards violations (80072 Personal Rights(a)(3), 80065 Personnel Requirements(a), and 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision(a)) and one Interim Licensing Standards v.4 87065.1 Supervision, Evaluation and Training Requirement (c)(5) violation.

ASW stated that the water heater was inaccessible as they built a solid cabinet around it (no doors - see photo) to keep the youth away from it. LPA is issuing a Type A citation for Section 80088 Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment, and Supplies.

Interviews indicated that there had been only one staff person during the morning shift, which began at 7am.

The purpose of the visit was to complete a follow-up inspection for Legal/Non-Compliance. On 2/19/2025 the licensee participated in a Legal Non-Compliance Conference at the San Bruno CCL office. The Licensee agreed to do the following in order to bring the facility into compliance no later than the following dates: Quarterly Inspections: The facility will be subject to increased monitoring by (Community Care Licensing) CCL, which may include but is not limited to increased inspections, record reviews, and interviews with facility residents and personnel. CCL will conduct quarterly inspections for 2 years assessing facility premises compliance and completeness of records and trainings. Training Binder: Facility will create training binder/folder within 30 days of NCC to show initial training for each staff person, annual training logs, and separate training records for facility manager and Administrator. Which include: Training topics, training hours, training materials, training dates, and trainers information. Training binders must be available upon demand, and in the facility during regular business hours. Personnel Records(80044)(c) Staff Training: Within 60 days of this NCC, Licensee will ensure that each staff member who interacts with residents receives additional training on the California Code of Regulations, Title 22 requirements for (1) Personal Rights; (2) Needs and Services Plans and Modifications to Needs and Services Plan; (3) Emergency Interventions; and (4) Title 22 Regulations. The Personal Rights training will be obtained through an outside training program, and the other trainings may be held in-house. The certificates for outside training(s) and the detailed training materials for in-house trainings will be submitted to the licensing agency as well as maintained on site for future training purposes. The licensee shall develop a post-training competency test/evaluation covering the above topics, and completed tests/evaluations for each training participant shall be available for review on site.\n\n4. LIC 500: Beginning the month of this NCC, facility will complete quarterly submission of LIC 500/staff schedules to CCL, including Administrator hours worked at the facility. Administrator should be on the premises for a minimum of 30 hours per week. Administrator cannot oversee both facilities, and the facility is to send CCL a monthly update and process until they find another Administrator. 5. Access to Files, Needs and Services Plans: Facility will create a plan within 30 days to make staff and youth files readily available for LPA access on inspection. Also, will ensure that all Needs and Service Plans and Updates are available upon request for review. 6. Technical Support Program (optional): CCL has recommended TSP (Technical Support Program) for the facility. If the facility is interested they will notify CCL within 30 days with a written notice. LPA Bertoli reviewed the above items with Administrator Kennedy. The discussion was as follows: Quarterly inspections will continue as stated. LPA will contact Administrator upon arrival to the facility (if not already present) to facilitate access to records. Facility is starting to put together training binder and is expected to be completed by next inspection. Staff training is being completed as stated. No changes in staff since last visit. Training records will be reviewed during next inspection. LIC 500 has been received and is up to date. Facility has a staff person that is a prior Administrator that is in the process of reactivating his Administrator Certificate. This will result in having separate Administrators for each facility. Facility is working on more direct access to staff files. This will likely result in having records available online so that they can be sent to LPA if Administrator is not available on site to access them. Facility may utilize Technical Support Program and will notify LPA when they are ready to do so. No deficiencies were cited at this visit. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator Kennedy and a copy of this report was given to him.",

LPAs observed the facility to maintain individual client files. The facility is a two-story house in a residential neighborhood and has 3 double-occupancy bedrooms and 3 client bathrooms. LPAs observed the hot water to measure within the permitted range. There is a pool in the backyard that is surrounded by a tall fence with a locked gate. During the tour, around 12:40PM, LPAs observed some areas in need of cleaning. There was trash and food debris and substance residue on the stairs, trash piles in the downstairs den, and unwashed plates in client room and in den, one of the downstairs bathroom vents was blocked with dust, and the kitchen refrigerator had food residue and debris throughout interiors and had the bottom vent blocked with dust. LPAs observed unsecured medications in a client's bedroom. Case Manager was unfamiliar with the items and removed them from the client's bedroom. LPAs also observed multiple beds with none to limited bed linens and linens in the linen closet were not readily accessible due to disorganization of closet and it being unclear whether linens were clean and unused. During the personnel file review, LPAs found that staff S1 (See LIC 811) does not have a background clearance associated to the facility. LPAs informed Administrator about the need to remove the staff from the premises. SEE PAGE 2\n\nPAGE 2 During the client file review, LPAs observed that 4 of 5 client files were missing tuberculosis (TB) test results and 5 of 5 client files were missing current allowance distribution records. LPAs are issuing citations of California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Sections 80076 Food Service, 80087 Buildings and Grounds, 80019 Criminal Record Clearance, 80069 Client Medical Assessments, 80070 Client Records, and Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87088 Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment, and Supplies. Additionally, due to the criminal record clearance violation, per CCR 80019(g), LPAs are assessing an immediate civil penalty of $100 per day in violation up to 5 days in violation, for a total of $500.

During visit, LPA reviewed 5 personnel files, emergency intervention records, disaster preparedness records, and other operations-related records. LPA also discussed with Administrator inspection authority and ways to ensure the availability of personnel files upon request at the facility site while also ensuring the privacy of staff members' confidential information. During the record review, LPA observed files to be well-organized and complete with all required sections. However, LPA observed deficiencies within some sections. LPA learned that the emergency intervention training does not include a hands-on competency test. LPA observed that 4 of 5 staff files reviewed had expired emergency intervention certification. LPA observed that 4 of 4 care staff files were missing performance evaluations. LPA observed that no staff files contained facility manager training, including those staff indicated by Administrator to be facility managers.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza, on 01/27/2020 at 11:30 AM, conducted scheduled case management via Microsoft Team (virtual inspection) due to COVID-19. During the inspection, LPA Mendoza met with Administrator Augie Arballo and Justine Underhill, Chief Program Officer. The purpose of today's meeting was to discuss the recent incident/discharge on (C1) (please refer to LIC 811, dated 01/27/2021 for confidential names.) Also, to discuss the facility's current implementation/ COVID-19 Mask Wearing Policy. On 12/10/21 San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) and Community Care Licensing (CCL) held a COVID-19 Migration meeting with the facility. During the meeting, the facility informed both agencies that the facility implemented a Mask Wearing Policy for the clients in care, approved by Licensing Program Manager Zaid Hakim and Regional Manager Nelson Martinez. The Mask Wearing Policy is to ensure that the facility maintains the safest possible environment. That all clients and staff must wear a mask while on campus and when around others. The Mask Wearing Policy is administered to all new clients and their authorized representatives at intake and discussed with both parties. Per the conditions, the youth is given three incidents/chances. During each incident the facility/ clients team will be working closely with the authorized representative and scheduling meetings/phone calls, and coming up with a safety plan on getting the youth to wear their masks. If it gets to three incidents, then the facility will be discussing discharging the child from the program. During the 12/10/20 meeting, CCL stressed the importance of a behavioral approach that is consistent with their Program Statement and the STRTP Interim Licensing Standards. Cont. LIC 809-C\n\nThere would need to be a reasonable process to engage in before discharging the youth. If the facility happens to come across this, they must notify LPA Mendoza and would need to start with having incident reports sent on initial and subsequent refusals to wear masks. Also, should follow all recent ACL (All County Letters) and PINS (Provider Information Notices). The facility informed CCL that they would comply with the above. On 1/19/21 via email LPA Mendoza was informed by Justine that the facility has a new client (C1) who is showing early signs of refusing to wear their mask. The facility will start implementing their Mask Wearing Policy and will reach out to the authorized representative if there are no changes. They wanted guidance on what to do if the client continues. LPA responded, the staff should be documenting all of this, and must include how frequent the client needs prompting on this behavior. If the behavior continues after the facility meets with the authorized representative and create a safety plan an incident report must be submitted to LPA Mendoza. In the incident report, the facility should include the safety plan/strategies that the facility will be doing with the youth, and include what was discussed in the meeting and who attended. Also, to include the number of interventions that the facility staff took with the youth, and what they were and they outcomes. If it gets to the final stages where the facility will be discharging the youth the facility must send another incident report/follow up. Include in the IR that this is the clients final stage on Mask Wearing Policy and include what was discussed with the authorized representative and attach the discharge notice that was submitted to the authorized representative. On 1/25/2020 LPA Mendoza received another email from Justine informing LPA that C1 is still refusing to wear their mask, and the facility staff have had three separate meetings with the C1, C1's treatment team, and parent. The facility is planning to discharge the C1. LPA received two SIR on 1/26/21, dated 1/20/21 and 1/21/21. After reviewing both SIR the facility did not include what the clients safety plan around mask wearing, or what was discussed in the meetings. The SIR had no information on dates or times the facility meeting with C1's authorized representative. The facility asked C1 open ended questions about the mask wearing policy. Both SIRs did not elaborate on steps or methods that the\n\nfacility took. Also, what were the outcomes from each step. Per the IR, C1 would struggle with following staff instructions to keep her mask on above her nose and mouth throughout the day. 1/21/21 was the final warning and IR did not include discharge notices or written notice that was sent to authorized representative. During todays inspection, LPA took the time to go over CCL's expectations when it comes to Mask Wearing Policy and ILS 87068.4 Removal And/Or Transfer Procedures. LPA expressed the importance of the facility sending detailed IRs to LPA Mendoza and to submit them to LPA within 24-48 hours if the youth is exhibiting daily struggles with mask wearing. The IRs must include all the interventions that were taken, outcomes, issue around mask wearing, and include the seriousness/urgency on removing the youth. IR must include the timeline on discussions, meetings, and phone calls. If it reaches to the level of discharging the youth. The facility must follow ILS 87068.4 and ensure they submit a written notice to authorized representative and include the authorized rep in discharge procedure. C1 struggled with wearing her mask on a daily. The facility has to constantly prompt the youth to wear or mask. The facility even got the C1 different types of mask, however C1 still refused. C1 will be getting discharged today at 3:30. C1 was a private placement/hospital diversion and was only scheduled to receive services with the facility for 14 days. C1's mother agreed to pick up the youth. The facility informed LPA that the facility had a total of 5 SIRs on C1 regarding mask wearing. Administrator, will forward SIRs the additional 3 IRs that LPA is missing 2nd 21st IR, 23rd, and 26th) to LPA by end of day. No citations were cited during todays inspection. An exit interview was conducted. Administrator agrees to sign all three documents and will return back to LPA via email.",

    "narrative": "A Case Management Legal/Non-Compliance on 02/02/2020 at 3:30 pm was conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams due the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Non-Compliance quarterly submissions from April 2020 to December 2020 and other conditions of the NCC. During the meeting CCL staff and facility staff also discussed a new electronic staff training system that the facility would like to incorporate. Present in the meeting were Chief Executive Officer, Lynn Dolce, Chief Program Officer Justine Underhill, Human Resources Director, Michael Russel, and Administrator, Augie Arballo. Present from CDSS were Regional Manager (RM) Nelson Martinez, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Zaid Hakim, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Brian Bertoli, and Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) David Hiett. On 10/07/2019 a Non-Compliance Conference (NCC) was held with facility representatives. Following the 10/07/2019 NCC, it was determined the facility was not in full compliance in meeting CCL\u2019s expectations regarding policies, procedures, and documentation. On 03/06/2020 an Informal Meeting was conducted to clarify CCL\u2019s expectations on NCC submissions. Per the NCC requirements, it was agreed that the facility will submit the below items to CCL in one complete package, on a quarterly basis on the 1st of every month. 1. Personal Rights Training- All staff training on CCL Personal Rights. The facility is to include a sign-in sheet, training materials, trainer\u2019s information/credentials, and include the length of this training. Please refer to LIC 809-C..\n\n2. \u201cWhat Grooming Looks Like\u201d Training-. All staff and clients at intake must be trained on this topic. The facility is to include a sign-in sheet. Sign-in sheets for clients will include the youths full name, DOB, authorized representatives full name, and date of placement. Training for both staff and youth will include training materials and trainer\u2019s qualification along with summary. 3. Training on Boundaries- An all staff training. The facility is to include a sign-in sheet, training materials, trainer\u2019s information/credentials, and include the length of this training. 4. Twice a month Upper Management team will conduct unannounced up night visits and submit log, with date time, and summary. This will be submitted quarterly. 5. Up night Bed Check Logs-Submit up night bed logs on a quarterly basis for all cottages. Complete full overnight bed log. Enter all information, youths name, room number, circle shift. Two staff conduct room checks. Both signatures, and manager initials and signs on bottom of each shift. LPA Mendoza received the following quarterly submissions: 05/01/2020, 08/01/2020, and 12/01/2020. The facility requested an extension in October 2020 to submit the 11/01/2020 submission on 12/01/2020 due to the facility having a COVID-19 outbreak, which was approved by LPM Hakim. The facility submitted all three NCC submissions on time and in a full package. LPA Mendoza notes the facility did not submit a complete submission on 05/01/2020, the facility submitted all items in various emails to LPA Mendoza. Which were observed to be complete after receipt of all items. Per the comprehensive review of all quarterly submissions from February 2020 to October 2020, LPA Mendoza found no issues with client training on grooming. This training is performed with new clients at intake. LPA observed the following inconsistencies with the bed logs and NCC submissions: Please cont.to LIC 809-C for additional page.\n\n\u00b7 Per the NCC, the facility is only required to submit the overnight logs. The facility submitted staff shift logs for all staff shifts (AM, Swing, and Overnight), rather than just the overnight records. This was acknowledged during the meeting on 02/02/2021 and the facility committed to correcting this item. \u00b7 Throughout LPA's review, LPA found several staff shift logs that did not have all items completed on the bed logs. At times, LPA could not always confirm the appropriate shift log, client's room number, or entry date. The facility must ensure to complete all items on overnight bed logs. This was acknowledged during the meeting on 02/02/2021 and the facility committed to correcting this item. Example: For February 2020, Halleck cottage did not have overnight bed logs for 2/1,2/2, 2/7, and 2/16. For February 2020, the upper managers only performed one random up night visit and not two. For the 08/1/2020 submission, which covers May 2020 to July 2020: May 2020 Halleck Cottage bed logs were missing: 5/6/20 and 5/12/2020. July Bed logs missing: 7/25/20, 7/29/20,7/30/20. Also, several entries did not have management approvals/signatures. For June 2020, there was only one upper management inspection performed. For the 12/01/2020 submission, which covers August 2020 to October 2020: September Stow Cottage, LPA observed numerous entries with only one staff performing bed checks due to the facility being short-staffed. Also, a few entries where bed checks started at 1-2 am. Overnight bed logs are to be performed from 10:15 pm- 6:45 am, with 15-minute bed checks. LPA Mendoza also found this with the October 2020 Halleck cottage. Also, for October 2020, LPA observed the facility did not conduct the twice a month upper management unannounced visit. Please cont. LIC 809-C.\n\nStaff training- The facility submitted several excel spreadsheets and a list of names for all staff training (Personal Rights, Personal Boundaries, and Grooming/Child Abuse). LPA found in every submission that all staff did not complete all three pieces of training. For the staff that did not complete any of the trainings, the facility did not give any explanation. Due to the high volume of excel sheets and the list of names, LPA had a difficult time cross-reference names because excel sheets did not always include all three training pieces in one excel sheet or list. Also, reports did not include the length of time of each training. The excel sheet only had the time the staff member completed the training. \u00b7 The facility is not required to submit Up night Facility manager logs. Moving forward, CCL is only asking for Upper Manager oversight logs to ensure staff accountability, to be verified 2x per month, captured on the training reporting tool. During today's meeting, CCL provided the facility with a new training reporting tool/excel sheet template that meets the Department\u2019s requirements per terms of the NCC. CCL would like the facility to incorporate this tool for all staff training and client grooming submissions, the benefit being a centralized document that is user-friendly and easy to understand. CCL informed the facility that CCL wants to ensure the facility follows all NCC guidelines, but that the tools used by both parties are practical and efficient. During the meeting LPA Hiett provided a demonstration of a sample training reporting tool and provided instruction as to how to navigate and use the training reporting tool. Facility staff mentioned that their own Staff Training team have existing internal methods and tools. The facility agreed to combine efforts in this area to produce a training reporting tool that meets the Department\u2019s requirements. The facility and CCL staff have agreed to work collaboratively on a training reporting tool. The primary focus of this NCC item is to ensure staff and client training(s) are conducted and reported, clearly. After discussing the NCC submission review, on 02/02/2021 CCL informed the facility that the facility had not yet fulfilled all NCC requirements. Therefore, the facility is to remain on Please refer to LIC 909-C.\n\nthe NCC status. The facility is to submit two more quarterly submissions, Due 04/01/2021 and 07/01/2021. After each submission, CCL will promptly complete a review of the submissions and schedule a meeting with the facility to review findings. The facility will continue to submit all NCC items along with the new training reporting tool. They are also requested to submit with their quarterly submission an updated LIC 500 (Staff schedule). LPA Mendoza will use this to cross-reference staff names with the staff training submission to ensure all staff has completed the required quarterly training. LPA Mendoza reminded the facility for the 04/01/20 submission to include the overnight bed logs for November 2020 and December 2020. The facility agreed to submit the following on 04/01/2021 and 07/01/2021: 1. Up night bed check logs for that quarter 2. Training Reporting Tool (or variation) including the following: Client Grooming training during intake, Staff training \u2013 Personal Rights, Grooming, Client / Staff Boundaries, Upper Manager up night bed check log oversight 2x per month 3. Training material 4. LIC 500 for that quarter ** Up night bed check logs for November 2020 and December 2020 to be submitted on 04/01/2021 as well. Following the future quarterly submissions on 04/01/2021 and 07/01/2021 \u2013 CCL and facility staff will conduct a meeting to review findings and discuss facility standing. Based on quarterly submissions and overall facility performance with respect to compliance and health safety, CCL will re-evaluate NCC status. Please continue to LIC 809-C...\n\nLastly, the facility informed CCL that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the facility HR team have been working remotely, and the facility is looking to create all staff personnel folders and training electronically. Michael, the new HR Director, is currently working on this and wanted to ensure that it would follow all CCL standards. CCL informed the facility that the department does not have an issue with them migrating their personnel files to be stored electronically. CCL stressed the importance of ensuring that all staff files and training must be readily available during all inspections. All staff must have the required LIC forms per annual reviews, initial training, ongoing training, etc. The facility can either do them electronically or keep a file at the facility. Also, the facility must ensure that it follows all policies and requirements per Title 22 Regulations. CEO informed CCL that the HR director or HR personnel would only have access to staff records/training. CCL advised the facility that a staff that is physically in the facility must have access. CCL inspections are unannounced, so the facility needs to ensure that the files are readily available within 20-30 minutes of LPA\u2019s arrival and request. The facility agreed to these conditions. CCL understands the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and is committed to being flexible and working collaboratively with the facility. This report was sent via email to Chief Executive Officer Lynn Dolce, Chief Program Officer Justine Underhill, Human Resources Director Michael Russel, and Administrator Augie Arballo for signature. The facility agrees to sign and scan back to LPA Mendoza no later than 02/04/2021. This report was revised on 02/04/2021 to correct typos. The facility received a corrected version of this report on 02/04/2021.",

LPA met with Administrator Augie Arballo. Due to COVID-19 social distancing orders, this visit was scheduled in advance as a tele-visit. On 04/20/2020 it was reported to Community Care Licensing (CCL) that a former overnight staff member (S1) (please refer to LIC 811 for confidential names, dated 02/16/21) sexually abused (C1) while in care. Based on the severity, it was referred to IB and accepted as a full investigation. Based on the IB report, Case No: CD1420-04069 in which Investigator, interviewed numerous individuals; Edgewood staff(s), former, and former residents, and reviewed documentation. There was no sufficient evidence to confirm if (C1) was sexually abused by (S1) while in care. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the above allegation therefore, the above allegation is Unsubstantiated. After LPA Mendoza thoroughly reviewed the IB report and reviewed all interviews and documentation it was learned that the facility failed to keep C1 safe back in 2018 when C1 was in care. The facility failed to keep all of C1\u2019s records from 2018. It was reported that (C1) reported feeling very uncomfortable and unsafe in the facility because of another client (C2). This client would try to touch (C1) inappropriately when staff members were not around and wrote inappropriate love letters to C1. Due to this, the facility conducted an internal investigation, on 06/08/2018 in which showed that (C2) wrote two love letters C1 and prove the above to be true. The above information, could have helped IB Investigator, McIntosh with their investigation because it was reported to CCL that S1 wrote love letters to C1. However, IB was unable to obtain copies of these love letters. Please refer to LIC 809-C for additional pages.\n\nBecause the facility no longer had these letters in C1's file. The facility is cited for California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Interim Licensing Standards, Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program: 87070(f) Children\u2019s Records and 87072(10) Personal Rights. Exit interview conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to the Administrator for signature. Please refer to LIC 809-D. Appeal rights were discussed.",

    "narrative": "On Wednesday, April 14, 2021, at 2:20 PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza made a case management visit to the facility regarding several Special Incident Report (SIRs) that were submitted to Community Care Licensing on April 6, 2021, regarding inappropriate touching between clients. The SIR dated (04/01/21) stated that Client #1 (C1) (see Confidential Names form (LIC 811), dated April 14, 2021}) reported to staff that (C1) has been \"sexually touched\" by another client (C2). The purpose of today's inspection was to gather additional information and interview the Administrator and (C1). Also, collect Need and Service and Behavior Plan for the three involved clients: (C1), (C2), and (C3). Based on documentation/incident reports, two dated 4/1/21 for (C1 and C3), 4/5/21 SIR (C1) and 4/6/21 SIR (C1), and interviews that LPA Mendoza conducted with staff members and clients, it was confirmed that there was inappropriate touching between C1 and C2 and another client (C3) witnessed it. All three clients were watching a movie in a common area, and C2 touched C1's private part over his pants. Also, staff members found a letter that former client (C2) wrote to (C1) about the incident. The facility submitted a copy of this letter to LPA Mendoza on 04/09/21 and submitted an incident report. Based on interviews it was confirmed that inappropriate touching occurred between C1 and C2. A staff member was present but was sitting at a far distance and did not see the incident. Also, interviews confirmed that (C1) and (C2) dated for a short time while at the facility. Both clients would write letters to each other to support one another during their stay at the facility, which would bring comfort to both youth.

    "narrative": "On Tuesday 6/22/21 at 9AM, Licensing Program Analysts (LPA's) Isabel Mendoza and Mariah Hawkins met with facility Administrator Augie Arballo for an unannounced annual/required inspection. The STRTP facility consists of four cottages, and only two cottages are being used (Stow and Halleck). This STRTP is licensed for a capacity of 48 and currently has a census of 15 with 7 residents in Halleck and 8 in Stow. At 9:20AM, LPA's Mendoza and Hawkins inspected Stow Cottage. At 10:45AM, LPA's inspected Hallek. LPA's observed the following: Water temperature measured 85 F throughout the cottage. LPA advised the facility to change the temperature. The heater was adjusted, and at 10:38AM the water measured 105 F. At 9:31AM, LPA's observed that the Stow living room / lounge spaces were untidy. There were cards and games pieces spread out on shelves in a disorganized fashion. Halleck was inspected afterwards and was observed to be tidier, but LPA's still observed games pieces on the floor and tossed into drawers without being put away properly, such as back in the puzzle or game box. At 9:54AM, LPA's observed the Stow recreation room to be untidy and unclean. There were toys, game pieces, and other items on the floor and disorganized on the shelves. There was debris on the carpet, which did not appear to have been recently cleaned. Surfaces were unclean. Curtains were missing or in need of repair. At 9:49AM, LPA's observed three rat traps in the downstairs Stow utility room. Administrator stated the site does not have nor recently had a bug or mouse infestation or concern but does have an exterminator come out weekly. Multiple cobwebs and spiders were observed throughout the facility site. At 9:55AM, LPA's observed a trail of ants observed on two walls of the recreation room.\n\nAt 9:57AM, LPA's observed the table and couch in the hallway outside the Stow recreation room were dirty. At 9:58AM, LPA's observed behind the hallway table an exposed glue trap with dead bugs and a large dead spider on it. The trap appeared to be old and needed to be replaced. At 10:05AM, LPA's observed rat droppings, an exposed glue trap, and a plate underneath the sofa in the clinician's office in the Stow Cottage basement. At 12:50PM, LPA's inspected the exterminator invoices and observed the following: 6/14/21, 1 mouse removed from admin building, 1 mouse removed from Stow Cottage; 5/24/21, 2 mice removed from Lane Cottage basement and laundry room; 5/10/21, removed 2 mice from admin building, removed 1 mouse from Halleck Cottage kitchen dry food storage; 4/26/21, removed 1 mouse from admin building; 4/12/21, removed 2 mice from Halleck Cottage kitchen area and basement; 1/25/21, removed 1 mouse from admin building; 12/28/20, removed 1 rat from Stow Cottage, removed 2 mice from Williams Building (CSU building), removed 1 mouse from Lane Cottage basement, currently vacant; 11/30/20, removed 1 mouse from Lane Cottage basement; 11/17/20, removed 1 rat from admin building, removed 1 rat from Halleck Cottage; 8/14/20, removed 1 mouse from Stow Cottage under sink, removed 1 mouse from admin building basement, removed 1 mouse from Lane Cottage under stove; 7/21/20, removed 1 rat and 1 mouse. Per the invoice records for June 2020 through June 2021, the exterminator has removed over 20 rodents (mice, rats) from the various cottages and admin building, including from the kitchen, basement, and laundry, as well as rodents from external traps. No report regarding these incidents was made to CCL, and Administrator stated he was not aware of the issue. At 9:33AM, LPA's observed the Stow kitchen to be messy. Cabinets and drawers in each cottage have food crumbs and grime, the refrigerators in each cottage were dirty, pantry shelves in Halleck Cottage were dirty and had dripping containers. The kitchen and dining areas need to be cleaned and sanitized. LPA's observed a nonfunctional dishwasher in the Stow kitchen, a nonfunctional oven (glass door broken this morning) in the Halleck kitchen, and a nonfunctional refrigerator in the Halleck dining room. Staff stated the oven would be replaced and the refrigerator will be checked for functionality by the licensee's facilities department. Additionally, no menu was posted in the Stow kitchen, but staff moved the menu from upstairs to the kitchen.\n\nLPA's observed multiple spills of food or paint on walls throughout the site, including coffee spill on fan in upstairs Halleck, brown splatter in bedroom in Halleck, and unknown splatters near trash cans in Stow basement hallway. LPA's also observed small graffiti, such as a small drawing of male genitalia in the Halleck lounge; old ink marks, such as the billiards game list of client names from 4/06/06 on a cabinet door in the Stow recreation room; paint splatters, such as in the Halleck basement classroom cabinet areas and Halleck client bedroom; and stickers on the high ceilings of the upstairs Stow Cottage near the bedrooms. Staff were not clear as to how youth got the stickers on the ceiling. Administrator reported the facility is cleaned and disinfected at least three times each day at shift changes. Facility Manager S1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) reported that there is a cleaning crew who clean most of the site twice daily but focus more on frequently used spaces rather than pass-through spaces like hallways. At 10:30AM, and throughout the tour, LPA's observed the client bedrooms to be disorganized. Client belongings in the wardrobes and in the under bed storage were messy with items scattered around. Wardrobes were somewhat empty, clothes unfolded and piled inside, and not all clothes appeared to be clean. Staff reported clients are not always comfortable with staff touching their belongings, but clients do not appear to be assisted effectively with organization and related life skills. Administrator stated they will get cloth bins for wardrobe storage. At 10:33AM, LPA's observed more than 5 windows propped open with various items. Multiple bedroom windows were propped open with large books. One window was propped open with a puzzle box, one with a sweatshirt, and another window in one of the upstairs Stow bathrooms was propped open with a wad of paper towels. Some items, such as the books, could be hazardous if they fell from the window sill to the ground below. At 10:22AM, LPA's observed a posting in Stow Cottage of a dress code with policies such as disallowing shoulders from being uncovered. Administrator stated this is in the program plan, and LPA's requested this be checked. At approximately 11:30AM, Administrator reported to LPA's that after checking the program plan, the dress code policy is not included and was not approved by the Licensing agency.\n\nLPA's observed both first aid kits, in Stow and Halleck, to be incomplete with the following items missing or in very low supply: tweezers; alcohol pads; bandages; antiseptic solution. LPA's observed chairs in the upstairs hallways near the bedrooms blocking the passageway. The chairs were for staff providing supervision. LPA's advised that the chairs be moved to avoid obstructing the hallway or that smaller chairs be used, since the hallways are somewhat narrow. LPA's discussed the medication administration procedures with staff. Per staff, medications are transferred from the medication bottle to envelopes and given to evening/night staff to administer to youth who are to take medications at a time after the nursing staff have left for the day. LPA's advised the facility does not transfer medications between containers and instead have staff who have access to the medications administer the medications. Grounds were free of obstruction and hazards. There are no bodies of water on the premises. Administrator reported that there are no firearms or ammunition at the facility site. Medications are stored in medication cabinets in locked staff closets in the upstairs staff offices of each cottage and in the nursing office. Sharps were stored in locked cabinets in the kitchens and were inaccessible to clients. The facility had food to meet the 7-day nonperishable, 2-day perishable mandate. Clients have individual beds. Facility sketches were posted throughout the facility site. Room temperatures were maintained at comfortable temperatures within the permitted range. At visit, Administrator and LPA's discussed the facility policy to have clients be required to wear a mask while at the facility with a 3-step intervention plan for youth who do not wear a mask, which was implemented on 2/02/21. Administrator stated this policy was now under review by their agency in response to the mask mandate being partially lifted in the state. LPA's are issuing 4 citations per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80087 Buildings and Grounds, 80076 Food Services, 80075 Health Related Services, and 80022 Plan of Operation.\n\nAn annual continuation will be conducted to complete this annual inspection. LPA's received 15 staff files and 10 client files, which will be reviewed. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Administrator Augie Arballo, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "On Wednesday, July 21, 2021, at 10:15 AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza and Christopher Rollins conducted a Case Management legal/non-compliance inspection. LPA's met with Administrator Augie Arballo, and SF Regional Director, Christina Garcia . The purpose of the inspection was to provide the facility feedback on the 7/1/21 NCC submission. The 7/1/21 quarterly submission covers April 2021-June 2021 items. Please note, the April quarterly submission, which covers Jan - March 2021, was provided to the facility via email on 7/13/21. Per the NCC requirements, the facility submitted the below items via thumb drive to LPA Mendoza. 1. All staff is required to take the following training topics quarterly. Also, to provide a list of staff and training on the Excel template that CCL created. \u00b7 Personal Rights Training \u00b7 Child Abuse/\" What Grooming Looks Likes\" \u00b7 Boundaries 2. At intake, all youth trained on \"What grooming looks like\" 3. Twice a month, Upper Management conducts unannounced up-night visits. 4. Up night Bed Check Logs- for the following three months (April, May, and June) 5. November and December 2020 Up night bed check logs. CCL requested the facility to submit this on 4/1/21 submission during the 2/3/21 inspection. However, the facility did not, so LPA Mendoza asked the facility to submit it with the 7/1/21 submission. [CONT. to LIC 809-C]\n\n6. LIC 500/Staff schedule. The facility did not include the LIC 500 on the original submission, so LPA requested it on 7/8/21. Later that day, LPA obtained a copy of LIC 500. After conducting a comprehensive review on 7/1/21 submission, LPA observed the following items: LPA Mendoza found no issues with client training on grooming. This training is performed with new clients at intake. All staff required training has been complete. Twice a month, upper management random up night visits were completed in April, May, and June. During LPA\u2019s review of Excel training spreadsheet, it was learned that the facility includes all employees on the excel sheet. This information was communicated to LPA Mendoza via telephone. However, LIC 500 only listed all staff that provide care and supervision. The facility had a meeting with LPM Juanita Arroyo on 7/20/21 regarding the training excel sheet. The facility will update excel sheet and highlight all staff members who require all three training's. Due to the high volume of entries, LPA made a random selection and reviewed Halleck cottage overnight bed logs for the month of April and May. In April, there were 12 entries where staff performed single bed checks for long periods or several 15 min entries. In May, there was a total of 6-bed logs where staff performed two-person bed checks; all other entries were single bed checks. Based on internal \"justification forms,\" single bed checks were performed by one staff because of either; low staffing, insufficient staffing, or [CONT. to LIC 809-C]\n\n, or not enough staff coverage during breaks. LPA Mendoza obtained copies of the April and May justification forms. For the month of June, none were submitted. During LPA's review of May bed logs, the facility updated their overnight bed logs on 5/27/21. The overnight bed logs now request staff members to mark either \"yes\" or \"no\" if they performed single bed checks. This information was not communicated to LPA Mendoza per NCC condition. The facility will submit an updated Up night Policy reflecting change to the overnight bed logs. Also, LPA noticed that the overnight shift changed from 10:15 PM-6:45 AM to 10 PM to 8 AM. For the month of June, LPA reviewed Stow cottage logs and found a total of 13 entries where staff performed single bed checks. November and December 2020 bed logs: LPA reviewed November (Stow) cottage, and upon review, the facility only submitted 11/1/2020-11/5/2020 overnight bed logs. Administrator confirmed after 11/5/20 the facility did not have any clients in care, due to COVID-19 outbreak. LPA Mendoza reviewed Halleck's November bed logs, and 11/22/20-11/24/20 were missing. Also, there were four entries where staff performed single bed checks, or staff only did one-hour bed checks. LPA reviewed Stow December bed logs from 12/1/2020-12/10/2020, and bed checks were performed by two staff members every 15 minutes. Halleck bed logs from 12/1/20-12/14/20 were reviewed, and LPA observed five entries where staff did single bed checks. During the inspection, LPA Mendoza provided the facility with a copy of LPA's overnight bed log review for all five months, including all specific dates and times of single bed checks. CCL notified the facility that the facilities NCC status is still under review by CCL. Currently, the facility needs to submit the following items for 4/1/21 submission, which was provided via email. LIC 500 for the April NCC submission, justification forms for Stow cottage from Jan-March, and a written plan on what the Administrator and upper management team plan to do to ensure that the overnight has adequate coverage and following all NCC requirements. LPA Mendoza received a thumb drive for most recent bed logs for July, and reviewed several Halleck and found several single bed checks. Justification forms were not included, so LPA Mendoza gave it back to Administrator to include justification forms and submit to LPA. [ PLEASE REFER TO LIC 809-C]\n\nDuring todays inspection, Augie and Christina stated that the facilities initial overnight bed check policy stated if a single bed check was performed that the facility would do a justification form. The justification form would cover all single bed checks. During inspection, LPA reviewed all NCC/meeting reports and 812's and could not find anything on this matter. LPA will send policy to LPM for review for future clarification. An exit interview was conducted, and the facility was cited under California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 87065.5 Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios. A copy of the report was left with the Administrator.",

On allegation the facility failed to follow the up-night staff ratio during night hours. Interviews were consistent that the facility did not follow their up-night staff ratio, and their two person bed check because of staff shortages. As a result, staff had to perform single bed checks. Interviews also revealed that staff requested assistance from the upper management team, and based on the information LPA obtained it appeared to be a lack of communication between line staff and upper management team around coverage plan. LPA reviewed overnight bed logs for Halleck for April and May and Stow cottage for June. LPA found the following: In April, there were 12 entries where staff performed single bed checks. In May, there was a total of 6-bed logs where staff performed two-person bed checks, and all other entries were single bed checks. Based on \"justification forms,\" single bed checks were performed because \"low staffing, insufficient staffing, or not enough staff coverage during breaks.\" In June, there were 13 entries where staff performed single bed checks. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility did not have enough staff to meet the needs of the children. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the facility, and deficiencies were cited.",

The investigation revealed that two facility clients attacked a staff, Reference #1, at the facility. Reference #1 allegedly retaliated by hitting and choking the facility clients, but interviews with Reference #1 and other staff present during the incident did not corroborate the allegations that the staff hit or choked facility clients. Reference #1 stated that he re-directed the clients when they started to attack him, and when re-direction did not work, he distanced himself from the facility by leaving in his vehicle as the clients followed and attacked him even as he went to his vehicle that was parked right outside of the facility. There were two other staff present during the incident which indicated that the facility had adequate staffing during the incident. Other staff indicated that Reference #1 never hit or choked any of the clients, and staff did not neglect to intervene during the incident as they attempted to re-direct and stand between the clients and Reference #1 during the incident. Another staff indicated that none of the clients sustained any injuries from physical abuse by Reference #1. Confidential statements obtained from a facility client indicated that there were no injuries observed on any of the residents at the facility after the incident, and staff treat clients well and does not neglect intervening when necessary. Based on the information gathered, although the allegations may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations was not met, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

Administrator and staff had similar statements denying the allegation. Administrator and staff stated they do not speak to children inappropriately or rudely or overhear other staff treating children unfairly or rudely. Additionally, they stated that all children are treated the same and that they have not received complaints or information from children that suggest staff disrespect anyone in or out of the home. Interviews conducted with children varied in that one (1) child stated that they felt as though staff were disrespectful and that one (1) staff called them and another person an inappropriate name. However, child could not recall the specific date of when incident occurred or in what context and recounted the incident occurring only once. Interviews conducted with two (2) other children stated that all staff are nice and that they do not recall hearing anyone residing in the home or out being called inappropriate names by staff. Documents reviewed identified no incidents being documented of staff treating children disrespectfully. It was also alleged, facility feeds youths burnt food. Staff and Administrator denied the allegation and again had similar statements that various staff and children cook meals in the home. Staff could not recall an incident when staff or a child burned a meal or tried serving a burnt meal for someone to eat. Staff stated they monitor the children while they are cooking and if staff or children ever burned food, they would throw it out and cook something else. Children had similar statements in that they could not recall a specific incident of being served burnt food. Children stated that children and staff cook meals and that there is ample food to cook in the home. Lastly, it was alleged facility has expired food. During initial inspection LPA Mahecha and Administrator toured the home including the food supply. LPA observed perishable and non-perishable foods as well as the emergency food supply. LPA observed dates of when food was bought and dates of expiration. All food observed was properly marked and expiration dates were marked appropriately. Food was not observed to be moldy or have any past expiration dates. Staff had similar statements and stated that food is checked weekly, groceries are bought weekly and if moldy food is observed it is discarded immediately. Interviews conducted with children varied in that two (2) children stated that they had not observed expired or moldy food but one (1) child stated that they observed two-week-old expired food. LPA observed documented observation of alleged expired food, however, date observed was date of food being bought and not of expiration date. Additionally, documents reviewed identified groceries being bought weekly and ample food being bought for all children in care.\n\nLPA was unable to contact county social workers but documents reviewed identified incidents and issues occurring with one child but no documents identified issues with facility or staff within the facility. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

Due to restrictions of COVID-19, the case management was conducted by telephone. The purpose of the inspection was to follow up on a Special Incident Report received by the Department on January 29, 2021. LPA Portillo interviewed the Administrator and it was discovered that there were two staff monitoring the three clients (FC1, FC2, and FC3) while they were working out (See confidential names, LIC 811 dated 2/9/21). The staff ratio is 1/3 and due to the type of activity that was held outdoors, the ratio was 2/3. One facility manager and a mental health rebab specialist were present when FC1 and FC2 had an altercation over the FC1\u2019s wireless speaker. The two staff members were attempting to deescalate the situation between FC1 and FC2 when FC3 hide behind a sofa that was inside the gym area and removed a wooden leg that was attached to the couch from the bottom of the sofa. The Administrator stated that FC1 and FC3 had a previous argument a week before this incident took place. FC3 walked behind FC1 and hit him on the right side of his head near his temple with the wooden leg and went running to his room. FC1 was transported to the hospital and during an interview with the police officers, he decided to press charges against FC3. The officers viewed the surveillance video and arrested FC3 for Assault with A Deadly Weapon. FC3 was arrested and transported to Baldwin Park Police Dept station and his bed was closed. FC1 and FC2 were checked and cleared of any visible injuries. A signed copy of this report was provided to the facility.",

The purpose of the inspection was to discuss information discovered during the investigation of a complaint. During the investigation it was discovered that in January 2021 the agency was experiencing a shortage of staff, at the Scoffield House, the staff ratio was 2 staff to 6 children. On 1/26/21 a child in the home was restrained by a staff and an untrained staff observed the restraint which resulted in injury. When LPA asked staff if it was a choice to reach out to another house for help it was stated that it was not an option due to being short staffed. Per Bill this information is not true, and it was a possibility to reach out to other staff for support. While LPA reviewed the incident reports for 1/26/21 LPA observed that there was missing pertinent information in the report. LPA addressed these concerns with Bill Sneed. Bill and LPA Tinoco discussed the information that needs to be included in incident reports, Bill stated he will be making those corrections by retraining staff. The Department determined this to be an immediate risk to health and safety of the children in care at this time, therefore the Facility was cited for The Interim Licensing Standard (ILS) Chapter 7.5 Version 3.1 Articles 1 through 10.

The investigation included an inspection of the facility, confidential interviews, and a review of facility and foster children's records. The complaint alleged that lack of supervision resulted in inappropriate interactions between clients. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, based on confidential interviews there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation occurred. Therefore, the allegation that there was lack of supervision is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Stacy Catanzarite along with appeal rights.",

The facility however, is noting when children attend outside mental health services in the client file. See advisory note. At approximately 11:30am LPA Segura and Administrator Puga conducted a medication count and found it to be in compliance. LPA counted medication based on the centrally stored log start dates. The facility receives bubble packs from the pharmacy which made observing and count of the pills easier.

During this inspection, 7 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. 3 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 4 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, 05/26/2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Alvaro Juarez, Facility Administrator.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Hillary Hall received a phone call from Administrator (AD) Eric Perry on 12/30/2022 reporting a 24 hour notice of a Serious Incident. AD reported that the new facility therapist picked up a client on 12/29/21 from a visit in Colusa and was driving the client back to facility in Susanville. Client had just been picked up from a family visit and was emotionally distraught. The therapist stopped at a bank in Red Bluff and ran in, leaving the client in the car. While in the bank, the client stole the car. Law enforcement was notified. The car was found in Stonyford, CA and had minimal damage. The client had not been located. Facility was willing to take the client back. LPA interviewed therapist on 1/19/22. Therapist is now aware to not leave clients unsupervised in the vehicle. It was very cold the day of the incident and the therapist chose to allow the client to remain warm in the car. AD has completed a disciplinary write up with additional training for the therapist. LPA interviewed the county social worker (CSW) for the client on 1/26/2022. The client has no history of theft. CSW indicated that prior to the therapist picking up the client, CSW had just told the client they would not be able to return to their previous foster home and the client was distraught. On 1/11/2022, the client mailed a letter to their previous foster home indicating they were alive and well. The county believes the client is residing in Stonyford, CA with his biological father. The county will do a surprise visit to the home in an attempt to locate the client and would like to return the client to the facility if he is found timely. LPA reviewed the full Serious Incident Report and disciplinary write up. No citation is being issued for this case management. A signed copy of this report was delivered to the facility by Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Stefanie Whitlow on 1/27/2022.",

Interviews and record reviews were consistent that one client (C1) alleged abuse by another client (C2). C2 denied any abuse or involvement with C1. There were no witnesses to the alleged abuse. C1 gave different accounts of the abuse, and was vague in reporting dates and times of when it occurred, but stated it happened at night and lasted a few minutes. The same day that C1 informed staff of the alleged abuse, C1 was taken the doctor for an exam. C2 was removed from the facility the following day. Within three weeks, the Administrator had retrained all staff on night time supervision policies and procedures. LPA reviewed staff schedules and observed the facility had maintained appropriate staff ratio. C1 indicated to LPA he felt safe in the facility and was well cared for by staff. The Juvenile attorney added they did not feel the facility was neglectful in their level of supervision for the clients. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews, and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this LIC-9099 and LIC-9099C were provided to the facility.",

LPA Wendy Brown reviewed records from the facility and conducted eight interviews. Records indicate that one staff member observed an incident between a staff and a client on 7/30/2024. The staff provided a written report via email on 7/31/24, of the incident they observed, to the administrator, a senior facility manager, and the engineering supervisor. The facility initially determined the incident involved horseplay between the staff and client. After further internal review by the facility, the incident was interpreted as offensive and a potential safety risk for the client, warranting the facility filing a Serious Incident/Injury Report, a Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR), and termination of the involved staff. The SCAR was not submitted until 8/12/2024 and the 24-hour notice of the incident was submitted to the Department on 08/13/2024. The facility is being issued one citation per Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Section 80061(b)(1)(E): Upon the occurrence, during the operation of the facility, of any of the events specified in (1) below, a report shall be made to the licensing agency within the agency's next working day during its normal business hours.

    "narrative": "The Department has investigated the complaint that Staff improperly restrained youth. C1 was heading towards the front door entrance to run away and S1 was following behind C1. S1 was talking to C1 as C1 was trying to leave the home. C1 turned around and called S1 a \u201cbitch\u201d and attempted to hit S1. S1 then attempted to place C1 in a Small Child Restraint. C1 confirmed S1 placed one hand on C1\u2019s shoulder and turned C1 around. C2 and S1 stated C1 let her body go limp during the restrain and went to the floor. Protocol was not followed as outlined in the Program Statement by staff which resulted in a youth being placed in an improper restraint. The Program Statement states \u201cPhysical interventions will be employed when a child is in immediate danger of harming her/self or other and when other less restrictive interventions have failed, and a \u201cRestraint\u201d is defined as: The use of trained staff members to hold a young person to contain acute physical behavior\u201d the restrain was not executed properly which resulted in C1 going to the floor. Also, staff did not follow the Program Statement regarding \u201cStaff will first employ protective interventions (releases, deflections, proximity, and protective stance) when a child attempts to physical harm to staff or peers. Staff did not allow enough space between C1 therefore, the staff was not implementing proximity and a protective stance which resulted in a improperly restraint. The youth was restrained for behavior that did not present an imminent danger for injuring self or others which poses a potential Health, Safety, or Personal Rights risk to clients in care. As a result of the interviews conducted, documentation reviewed and investigation conducted, the allegation that staff improperly restrain youth is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met.

Staff was directed to leave because the hospital had a sit-in staff that remained with FY1. Staff stated that it was based on this reason that Staff presence was no longer required by the hospital. On 1/20/23, the Program Director provided the facility policy. The policy did not have any requirement that the staff should stay at the hospital with clients when they are taken for psychiatric treatment. LPA Ajaero was informed by LPA Michael Almaraz that during LPA\u2019s visit on 2/9/23, FY1 appeared to be under the influence and could not be interviewed by the LPA. On 2/2/2023, Reporting Party stated that at the time of FY1\u2019s evaluation, FY1 was attended to by a hospital sitter and that Hospitals in San Joaquin County have different protocols regarding if a legal guardian, referring to Facility staff, has to be present in the ER. Therefore, he could not firmly state whether the Staff was required or not. Additionally, reporting party stated that due to the emergent need for a mental health evaluation on the client, it was necessary to complete the evaluation without a legal guardian present. In addition, the Administrator denied any knowledge of any staff making inappropriate comments towards FY1. On 1/19/23, LPA interviewed the staff and they denied making the alleged statement. Lastly, LPA Ajaero made several attempts to interview FY1. FY1 is not available to respond to questions at this time because FY1 has been hospitalized with no definite day of release. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

On 12/22/22, C1 was declared brain dead at which time her biomother made the decision to remove C1 from the ventilator. C1 was pronounced deceased on 12/22/22 at 10:30 pm. During the course of the investigation, LPA Ajaero requested a copy of the death report and Paul Houser, Assistant Chief of the Investigation\u2019s Branch requested a copy of the Coroner\u2019s Report. The Coroner\u2019s Report did not list any drugs, alcohol, or suspicious activity that would contribute to the incident. The cause of death was listed as suicide by hanging. After a review of the interviews and documentation obtained but not limited to which includes the coroner\u2019s report, death certificate, Needs and Services Plans, CFT Notes, Progress Reports, Suicide Prevention Checklist, Incident Reports and Mental Health Services provided, this agency has determined that there were no violations of Title 22, Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations. No deficiencies were cited and no further follow up is required. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, and appeal rights were delivered to the Administrator",

C1 was placed at this Facility on 9/10/24, and then was given a 14-day notice of removal two days later, on 9/12/24. The youth was transferred to another Facility on 9/20/24, due to the staff not being able to keep her safe because of her frequent AWOL\u2019ing and dangerous behaviors while AWOL\u2019ing such as accepting rides from strangers. On 10/23/24, LPA requested the youth\u2019s Child Family Team (CFT) meeting notes to discuss preservation of placement prior to being removed. Although Administrator Gloria Losh stated that C1\u2019s therapist did do an Individual Crisis Intervention Management Plan (ICMP) and clinical assessments, there was no CFT meeting held. On 10/28/24. Gloria Losh stated they made numerous attempts to schedule a CFT meeting, but was unable to reach C1's County Social Worker, or the Social Worker's Supervisor. Page H-2 of the Facility\u2019s Plan of Operation state, \u201cIt is always the goal of EA to maintain the youth\u2019s placement when they are having difficulties with behavior or not meeting the Needs and Services Plan.

Confidential interviews revealed that during the child\u2019s two week stay, she had many physical altercations with another youth in care, and that staff had put hands on her once when attempting to prevent a physical fight between clients. An Incident Report (IR) was sent in by the facility on 9/12/24 describing an incident where S4 held C1\u2019s wrists for less than 20 seconds when she was going in to beat up another client and was also swinging at the staff member. Confidential interviews with staff revealed that C1 was threatening to hit C2 with a water bottle, so staff collected all water bottles in the facility, and locked them up to prevent this from happening. In an interview with C1, when asked about an incident with a water bottle, the youth stated that she was the one who tried to, \u201chit C2 upside the head with a water bottle\u201d. C1 stated, on another occasion, S1 told her to \u2018get out of the way\u2019 and pushed her. C1 stated S3 was a witness. S1 stated, no staff had ever pushed C1, and S3 stated she never saw anyone push C1 either, resulting in conflicting information.

On December 14, 2023, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging S1 is providing alcohol to minors while in care, S1 is providing marijuana to the minors while in care, S1 is providing nicotine products to the minors while in care, and minors provided S1 their allowance to buy nicotine products. During the investigation there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegations. Although CCL received detailed information that S1 provided alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine products to clients in care during transportation services that were facilitated by S1, and that clients provided S1 with their allowances to buy these products. The information provided to the Investigator regarding these allegations was inconsistent. Confidential interviews deny the allegations while another confidential interview maintains that the allegations involving S1 are true. Confidential interviews further reported that facility staff inquired about these allegations with S1 prior to resignation and the allegations were denied. A confidential interview reported that when reviewing receipts of the client\u2019s allowances there was nothing suspicious observed that would indicate that allowances were spent on alcohol, marijuana, or nicotine products. There were no other known witnesses to the allegations and S1 could not be reached for comment. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegations that staff is providing alcohol to minors while in care, staff is providing marijuana to the minors while in care, staff is providing nicotine products to the minors while in care, and minors provided a staff member their allowance to buy nicotine products, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Facility Manager, Angelita Arellano.",

Confidential interview gave conflicting statements: S4 did not request C1 to return to the facility to pick up school supplies, while another interview states that it did occur. Confidential interviews revealed that S3 speaks to C1 in a demanding tone of voice and may be considered as threatening or inappropriate. Some interviews entailed S3 and other staff to be courteous and respectful and would never provoke, threaten, and speak to the clients inappropriately. There were no witnesses to the alleged incident. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegation that staff provokes C1 in care, staff threatened C1 in care, and staff inappropriately spoke to C1 in care may have occurred, however, is not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "On August 22, 2022, Community Care Licensing received a complaint alleging that staff speaks inappropriately to minors. Confidential interviews stated that no staff member at the STRTP has made any threats of killing a client. Confidential interviews did, however, admit that there was an incident that occurred involving S4 and Client 4 (C4). Confidential interviews further stated that S4 called \u201cC4 White trash\u201d and words were exchange between the staff member and C4. Confidential interviews also stated that the STRTP has a zero tolerance for such behaviors and have acted on those staff members behaviors. Other confidential interviews reported not witnessing staff members being inappropriate to clients. During record review LPA Urena found that the incident involving C4, and a S4 was documented by the STRTP. The documents that were collected are dated July 25, 2022, and July 26, 2022. All documents indicate that S4 did engage and exhibited inappropriate behaviors which resulted in S4 calling C4 \u201cWhite trash\u201d. Based on confidential interviews and file reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegation that S4 speaks inappropriately to C4 is supported and proven by evidence. The facility is cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Treatment Facility (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards Section 87072(c)(10) PERSONAL RIGHTS. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Facility Manager, Sydney Casillas\n\nOn August 22, 2022, Community Care Licensing received a complaint alleging that the facility does not meet minors' dietary needs. More specifically, staff lock the pantry and do not provide bread or fruit to C1 after 8:30 PM. LPA obtained conflicting statements throughout the investigation. Confidential interviews revealed that the staff prepares three meals per day and snacks between each meal. Confidential interviews revealed that the pantry closes at 8:30 PM and the bread is locked, however, the clients are provided a couple of options; they can have the left-over food from that day or they can make a sandwich and the staff will provide the clients with the ingredients. Other confidential interviews revealed that the left-over food cooked by staff was left out and exposed to flies therefore some clients refused to eat the food. Confidential interviews revealed that the clients have complained about only having sandwiches for a late-night snack and that C1 wants special food and if C1 did not get what C1 wanted C1 ended up breaking into the pantry at the facility. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that the facility is not meeting minors\u2019 dietary needs, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Facility Manager, Sydney Casillas",

Confidential interviews and record review revealed on January 10, 2021 around 8 pm, S2 assisted C1 with showering and S2 did not observe any marks or injuries to C1. Additional confidential interviews and record review revealed the night of January 10, 2021, C1 did not sleep well and was up most of the night so the morning of January 11, 2021, C1 did not want to get up for school. Confidential interviews and record review revealed around 8:30-8:45 am, S3 and S6 were in C1\u2019s bedroom trying to get C1 to get up for school. Record review and confidential interviews revealed C1 was combative by kicking and hitting S3 and S6 during this time. Confidential interviews with S3 and S6 revealed they did not have to use physical force to get C1 out of bed but used verbal encouragement. Other confidential interviews revealed there was yelling and clapping heard from C1\u2019s bedroom while S3 and S6 were trying to get C1 out of bed. Confidential interviews revealed C1 eventually got up and went to the restroom where S3 and S6 assisted C1 with changing. Confidential interviews indicated S3 and S6 did not observe any marks or injuries to C1 at that time. Confidential interviews also indicated that after C1 changed and before going to school, C1 was jumping on the beds and couch in the facility as well as climbing over C1\u2019s dresser in C1\u2019s bedroom. Confidential interviews revealed at 9:00 am C1 then went to school at the facility campus cafeteria. Confidential interviews revealed around 9:30 am, S5 took C1 to the restroom and noticed a scratch and redness on C1\u2019s upper thigh. Other confidential interviews revealed no one was sure how C1 obtained the injury and no incidents resulting in an injury to C1 had been observed. Further confidential interviews revealed C1 is an active boy and plays on the swings and trampoline often. Further interviews revealed no staff had been observed to physically restrain or hold C1 in any way. AD also stated she checked the cameras at the facility and did not observe C1 to have had any incidents resulting in an injury that day. AD stated it was also a possibility the injury may have been from the desk at school. Additionally, CSW had no concerns of C1\u2019s care in the facility and had not observed any prior injuries to C1. Based on confidential interviews and record review, C1 did sustain an unexplained injury while in care. However, the Department could not determine if the injury occurred due to physical abuse, lack of supervision, or while child was playing. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were explained and emailed to Facility Manager Gloria Thomas for signature. Signed reports will be placed in facility file.",

    "narrative": "Interviews and record review revealed approximately 12-13 clients attend virtual schooling in the STRTP cafe through five different schools. Five clients attend the same school as C1 however do not have the same teacher. Confidential interviews and record review revealed clients have different schedules but a majority of the clients attend school Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 8:45 am and work until approximately 2 to 3 pm. Interviews and record review revealed that day shift staff schedules are from 6 am to 3 pm and the same staff are in the cafe with clients for the whole school day. Record review revealed approximately 20 messages sent from ST between August 2020 through February 2021 indicating students (referring to C1 as well as other non-client students) were not logged in for small groups or ST was waiting for students (referring to C1 and other non-client students) to join. Record review revealed these messages were all sent between 1:20 pm and 1:30 pm. Confidential interviews revealed these messages were sent out if students were not yet logged back in after lunch and as a reminder. Additional confidential interviews revealed C1 would come back from lunch around 1:30 pm and would join small groups making it possible for the messages to go out before C1 joined. Confidential interviews revealed C1 had no attendance issues during small groups with RT from 1:30 pm to 2:00 pm, although noted the small groups did start at 1:15 pm. Interviews revealed C1 was returning late from lunch due to all clients being lined up to return to the cafe together. Review of C1\u2019s report card showed 59 days present and 2 days absent in the first trimester and showed 61 days present and 0 days absent in the second trimester. Confidential interviews revealed attendance is taken in the morning and not again in the afternoons but is monitored by ST in the afternoons. Confidential interviews revealed that there have been times C1 has missed afternoon class or logged off early and record review revealed that two messages were sent indicating C1 not being logged on after 2 pm. Interviews revealed after 2 pm to approximately 3:30 pm is independent work time for C1. Interviews revealed that due to clients\u2019 disruptive and dangerous behaviors in the afternoon AD asked SP that students from C1\u2019s school be able to log off of school at 2 pm. Confidential interviews revealed that all clients in virtual schooling were logged off at 2 pm to manage clients\u2019 disruptive behaviors for approximately 3-4 weeks from February to March 2021. Other interviews revealed only students that were completed with their school work were logged off at 2 pm while others stayed until 3 or 3:30 pm to complete work. Further confidential interviews revealed C1 had missed some afternoon class due to C1 saying C1 was finished with school and C1 also made it appear C1 had no further work by deleting it or rushing through it. (Continued)\n\nConfidential interviews also revealed in the first trimester of virtual schooling it was difficult to keep track of all the client\u2019s differing schedules however staff are in communication with clients\u2019 teachers when issues arise. Based on record review, confidential interviews and conflicting statements of what occurred, the allegation facility staff do not ensure that youths attend school may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were explained and emailed to Administrator Christina Torres for signature.

Confidential interviews reported C1 interpreted this to mean C1 was stupid and dumb; however conflicting statements reported C1 was being told C1 was moving slow as the residents were transitioning from one activity to another.

Confidential interviews stated that staff members are trained in the usage of Professional Assault Crisis Training (Pro-ACT) and denied restraining C1 inappropriately during the incident in care. It was indicated that a restraint was used because C1 was choking C2 in care and after multiple verbal redirections by staff C1 refused to stop and staff intervened by using an appropriate Pro-ACT restraint on C1 during the incident. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegation that staff inappropriately restrained C1 in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

In addition, confidential interviews disclosed that staff left the client\u2019s house for unclear reasons and clients were left unsupervised. A confidential interview stated that staff went to use the restroom while documents gathered indicated that staff went to do laundry. Multiple confidential interviews disclosed that when a client leaves the facility, staff would notice it right away and will follow AWOL protocol, however, a confidential interview and incident report corroborated that facility staff was not aware that the client AWOLed until law enforcement brought back C1 to the facility.

    "narrative": "Documentation and confidential interviews confirmed that C1 did sustain a fracture to their left arm, however the injury was caused by C1 falling off their bike. The incident report submitted to the Department reported that on October 5, 2025, C1 was seen riding their bike when they crashed while attempting to make a turn. The report notes that several staff members were present and attended to C1\u2019s \"cuts and scrapes.\" However, at the time of the fall, it was not known that C1 had broken their arm as a confidential interview reported that C1 got back on the bike afterward. C1 was kept under staff supervision to monitor for any pain or swelling to their arm. The following day, staff transported C1 to urgent care where a fracture was confirmed. There were allegations that C2 caused C1's injury, as it was reported that on the same day of the fall, C2 kicked in C1's bedroom door, potentially further injuring C1's arm. However, confidential statements regarding this incident were inconsistent and did not establish that C2's actions caused the fracture. Regarding the claim that STRTP staff did not prevent bullying, multiple confidential interviews indicated that C1 and C2 were housed in the same dormitory, and C1 frequently provoked C2. It was also reported that, in addition to clients always being under staff supervision, staff routinely intervened during conflicts. Although C2 and other clients occasionally \"teased\" each other, staff members were present to redirect behaviors and de-escalate situations as much as possible. Additionally, statements about whether C2 coerced C1 or other clients into bringing C2 food were inconsistent. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegations that due to a lack of Supervision a minor (C1) sustained a fracture while in care and staff did not prevent minor (C2) from bullying another minor (C1) may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report, along with the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated October 11, 2024, and appeal rights, was explained and provided to Chief Executive Officer Christina Torres.",

The investigation was conducted by Special Investigator (Inv) Shawniece Poinsette of the Community Care Licensing (CCL) Investigations Bureau. The investigation included interviews the facility staff (S1-S4), clients in care (C1-C6), and the County Social Worker (CSW).

Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Hamilton conducted a case management tele-inspection at Ferree\u2019s Group Home (GH) and met with Facility Manager Michael Barnett via Cisco Webex. Due to COVID-19 a tele-inspection was conducted. The purpose of the inspection was to address issues and concerns regarding incidents that occurred on or around April 25, 2020 and April 29, 2020. It was discovered through information received via confidential interviews that Client #1 (C1) was allegedly involved in a fight with three other clients of the GH on 04/25/2020. This incident resulted in Law Enforcement (LE) being contacted and C1 being transported to the hospital for medical treatment. In addition, C1 was AWOL 04/29/2020 to 05/05/2020 and the GH did not contact Community Care Licensing (CCL) or C1\u2019s County Social Worker (CSW). The Serious Incident Reports (SIRs) regarding the above incidents were obtained by LPA during a complaint investigation and during confidential interviews it was reported that GH staff forwarded the SIRs regarding the AWOL and the fight to CCL and CSW. LPA was unable to locate any SIR\u2019s regarding these incidents. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22 Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80061(b)(1)(E) Reporting Requirements. GH failed to report special incidents to CCL or C1\u2019s county social worker of C1\u2019s involvement in a fight and C1 being AWOL for multiple days. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, Confidential Names List, LIC 811 and appeal rights were emailed to facility manager Michael Barnett for signature. The signed reports will be placed in facility file.",

Regarding the child accessing illegal substance, a confidential interview stated that C1 used marijuana often and it was immediately addressed when observed to be under the influence. Facility staff denied child had access to marijuana while at the facility. It was reported that C1 was constantly AWOL (absent without leave). Two clients refused to interview.

Other confidential witness statements revealed that SFM walked into C1\u2019s bedroom without knocking while C1 was changing. Also, revealed was that C1 was made to feel uncomfortable at the facility due to SFM not allowing C1 privacy.

During investigation, confidential interview stated that facility has many in-house incident reports about C1\u2019s lack of school attendance. It was added that C1 and other client would procrastinate then be late to school. Additionally, it was stated that the facility would make multiple trips to school so no client would be late due to others taking to long to get ready. Confidential interview stated staff would encourage clients to get ready earlier so they could arrive to school on time. Additional confidential interview stated that C1 would always be late to school by choice. It was added that staff would encourage C1 to be on time and explained the importance of being at school and on time. Another confidential interview stated that it was staff\u2019s fault C1 was late to school because staff would take C1 to school late. It was added that sometimes the staff would take too long and so C1 would refuse to go to school rather than be late. LPA received conflicting information. In regard to the allegation that staff did not ensure minor attended appointment, it was specifically alleged that C1 had driver\u2019s training and staff wouldn\u2019t get C1 up after informing staff about the appointment in the same morning. Confidential interviews disclosed that messages would be received over the weekend for appointments for the following day, but the problem was that only facility managers have access to the voicemail box. It was added that drivers training was never confirmed with staff. Additionally confidential interview stated that staff ensured they went to their appointments and got them there on time. Another confidential interview stated that C1\u2019s mother called and left a message over the weekend about drivers training but that the day of the training staff did not wake C1 up and C1 missed the appointment. LPA received conflicting information. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that staff did not ensure C1 attended school and staff did not ensure C1 attended appointment may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was reviewed and provided to facility representative.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that C1 smoked in the facility confidential witnesses informed LPA that facility staff did not allow clients to smoke at the facility, but some clients smoked in their bedrooms anyway. Additionally, LPA was informed that clients smoked vape pens when staff were not present. LPA was informed vape pens did not release a strong scent which made it difficult for staff to notice if clients were smoking. Other complaint information revealed that C1 smoked inside the facility. In relation to the allegation that C1 had gone AWOL from the facility several times confidential witnesses informed LPA that staff would redirect clients when staff suspected that clients were going to go AWOL. Furthermore, it was disclosed to LPA that facility staff would shadow clients, offer clients other options when clients were going AWOL, and search for clients in the community when clients went AWOL. LPA was informed by another confidential witness that C1 went AWOL from the facility over three times, and they did not believe that the facility staff did enough to prevent C1\u2019s AWOL. Concerning the allegation that C1 missed three mental health appointments confidential witnesses informed LPA that C1 would refuse to attend mental health and other appointments. Additionally, LPA was informed that when the facility would reschedule C1\u2019s appointments C1 would refuse them again. During confidential witness interviews LPA was informed that the other children attended their appointments and staff would ensure that they did not miss any appointments. Other confidential witness revealed that facility staff did not ensure that C1 attended C1\u2019s appointments and staff did not reschedule missed appointments for C1. LPA received conflicting information regarding this allegation. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegations that C1 smoked in the facility, C1 had gone AWOL several times, and C1 missed three mental health appointments may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was provided to Tina Willis.",

It was specifically alleged that clients in the home attempted to stop the male from trying to attack the Facility Manager. Furthermore, it was reported that the clients in care were all in the street fighting with the male, law enforcement was called out to the home, and no one was hurt. During the investigation, a confidential interview stated that Adult #1(A1) came inside the STRTP to fight a resident because the resident said something to the Facility Manager (FM) that A1 did not like while the FM was on the phone with A1 prior to A1\u2019s arrival to the STRTP. Another confidential interview stated not witnessing the incident, but it was reported that client #1(C1) saw A1 inside the STRTP assisting FM with FM\u2019s belongings and C1 was verbally aggressive to A1 because C1 wanted to start something with A1. The same interview stated that FM and A1 were already inside their car getting ready to leave when C1 opened their car door and started swinging at A1 and a fight broke out. One confidential interview stated that C1 was arguing with FM while FM was on the phone with A1. Then, A1 showed up to the STRTP and C1 was following A1 and FM to the car and C1 opened the door and A1 got out and A1 and C1 started to fight. One confidential interview stated that C1 was being verbally aggressive towards FM and when A1 picked up FM from FM\u2019s shift at the STRTP, C1 opened the driver\u2019s side door and assaulted A1. Then, A1 got out of the vehicle and responded while staff #2(S2) was assisting in blocking C1. The interview continued by stating that C1 got away from S2 and ran towards an opened field to grab a metal pipe and assaulted A1 with the metal pipe. The same interview reported that C1 was hit by A1 once during the physical altercation. An additional confidential interview reported that C1 had been harassing FM the entire morning during FM\u2019s shift and making threats to FM. The confidential interview continued stating that FM was leaving for the day and A1 was waiting for FM at the STRTP\u2019s front door. Then, C1 began to yell at A1 and A1 got upset and FM walked A1 to their car. C1 went around the house and opened A1\u2019s car door and began to assault A1. A1 got out the car and confronted C1. The interviewer tried to deescalate C1 and asked FM to walk A1 up the street; however, C1 got a hold of a metal pipe and hit A1 on the head. The interviewer stated C1, and A1 exchanged punches and law enforcement showed up. County social worker stated not having concerns on the safety in the STRTP because C1 was the aggressor.\n\nBased on confidential interviews and records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore, the allegations that staff did not provide a safe environment for children in care and staff conduct poses a risk to children in care are substantiated at this time.

It was additionally reported that C3 was heard name calling C1 during a phone conversation with C1. Furthermore, it was reported that C3 had threated to kill C1. During investigation, a confidential interview stated that C1 would antagonize the clients, and C1 would say C1 was going to take revenge on them by hurting them. The same interview reported witnessing clients call C1 names, but they were redirected by staff. Other confidential interviews stated that C1 was not called any names and clients in care left C1 alone. Another confidential interview stated that C1 would bully the other clients in care and caused drama at the STRTP. The same interview reported that C1 had a 1:1 supervision during C1\u2019s short stay at the STRTP. Confidential interviews did not witness C3 threatening C1. Other information stated the violations occurred. In regard to the allegations that staff member mismanaged minor's medications, and minor did not receive medications as prescribed, it was alleged that client #1(C1) had not received medications and staff were aware of the situation and were not putting any protective measures in place. A confidential interview stated that when C1 was placed at the STRTP C1 came with a bag of medications but without forms or instructions on the medications. The same interview stated that it appeared that the medication was old because C1 was on runaway status for a long time before being placed at the STRTP. Another confidential interview stated that when the STRTP finally received C1\u2019s JV220 and medications, C1 would refuse to take C1\u2019s medication because C1 would say that the medications would make C1 sleepy. One confidential interview stated C1 did not have a psychiatric appointment because C1 was placed at the STRTP for only a week. Other confidential interviews did not have information regarding the alleged violations. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that staff do not prevent client #1 from being bullied by other minors while in care, staff did not provide a safe environment for client #1, and staff mismanaged client #1\u2019s medications, and client #1 did not receive medications as prescribed may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the alleged violations. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, Appeal Rights, and LIC811 were provided to Facility Manager Tina Willis.",

The focused staff (FS) who was identified in the referral denied the allegation that he hit or handled a client in a rough manner on 06/17/2021, two other staff workers who were present corroborated the explanation and has denied any form of abuse towards the client(s). The FS explained after retrieving some contraband items from a client's bedroom, it was reported that the one focused client (FC) was agitated and was walking behind him in a very aggressive manner and believed that he was going to be attacked. The FS worker turn around and bumped into the focused client, causing the FC to loose his balance and fell on top of his bed. No injuries were reported.

The CSW has no concerns about staff working at the facility.

Additionally, on 6/17/2021 the department received another incident report regarding a child taking a bottle of unsecured cold medicine out of the manager\u2019s office. Facility manager stated the following: In regard to the incident report regarding child being raped and possibly killing someone the child stated they had consensual sex with a friend. They stated that they did not want to have sex with them but ended up doing it anyway. When staff was questioning child about what happened and inquiring details as to what transpired child made a statement of if I killed someone would you ask me all these questions. Facility manager stated that no specific information was given of friend who child had sex with or that child killed someone. The incident report with the cold medicine was my personal medication for relieving cough. I had the bottle out in the office. I stepped out of the office to ask a child a question and did not lock or close the door behind me. A child went into the manager\u2019s office and took my bottle of cold medicine and placed it in their pants. I was unable to retrieve the bottle as the child refused to give it back or take it from their pants. The cold medicine contained no alcohol and was an over the counter medication. Based on the information provided by the facility manager LPA identified the following deficiency. 80075 Health Related Services (k) The following requirements shall apply to medications which are centrally stored: (1) Medication shall be kept in a safe and locked place that is not accessible to persons other than employees responsible for the supervision of the centrally stored medication.\n\nLPA requested a copy of completed training for deficiency cited.

    "narrative": "On 05/27/2022, the Department received a complaint alleging that clients are allowed to smoke marijuana while at the facility. Staff members who were interviewed denied the allegation that clients are allowed to smoke in the facility, including activities outside of the facility grounds. LPA was informed by some staff members that at times they have caught client(s) smoking or vaping inside their bedroom while conducting routine checks and were able to confiscate the contraband and document the incident. Staff workers, including the Administrator, stated that staff are always present and are working professionally. In confidential interviews, all clients interviewed denied the allegation that staff working at the facility allowed them to smoke marijuana or any other form of tobacco or device such as a vape. Two clients denied that clients ever smoke at the facility and were not aware of others doing so. Other clients admitted smoking marijuana away from the facility. The other clients disclosed that they obtained the marijuana from other students at the school and were smoking on the school grounds. One individual identified as other reportedly disclosed that a client commented that staff knows and does nothing when they see clients smoking. Individual identified as other could not be contacted and therefore no statement was obtained. County Social Worker that was mentioned in the county referral could not be contacted, therefore no statement was obtained. When interviewed, the County Emergency Response Worker (ER) did not have any immediate concerns at that time. Statements obtained could not corroborate the allegation reported. Therefore, the above allegation of neglect/lack of supervision is determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the facility representative for review and signature. No deficiencies were cited at this time",

One bottle was discovered during a room check administered on client\u2019s room. The other bottle was presented to the therapist by client for no known reason. We do not administer over the counter medications to the children, so we believe child is stealing the items from the store. Child is on psychotropic medications and was transferred from our sister location where it was noted of child\u2019s behavior. The facility conducts room checks frequently and continue to monitor children with community passes to be aware and prevent any incidents such as this from occurring again.

(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, 05/22/24). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, and youth safety plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Camara observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident.

The investigation revealed third party information of an alleged exchange of unconfirmed items between parties. Furthermore, it revealed an opposition to the facility being in the neighborhood. The minors denied the allegation and causing any issues with their neighbors. Minors have community passes but they do not loiter around the neighborhood or trespass in neighbors\u2019 properties. Staff denied being aware of the incident as alleged and stated that minors in care do not engage in such criminal activity. Although there were issues with some of their neighbors in the past, the issues were resolved. Neighbors know to contact the Administrator for any concerns. Based on the evidence above, the allegation of neglect/lack of supervision is closed as unsubstantiated.

LPA met with the representative named above and discussed the purpose of the visit. On December 31, 2022 the Department received a Special Incident Report regarding an incident that occurred at the facility on December 30, 2022. Upon review of the Special Incident Report, it was determined that due to the nature of the incident, a suspected child abuse report to the county hotline was warranted but not completed by the Licensee. Based on records reviewed, the Licensee is being cited for violation of California Code & Regulations Title 22, Div. 6, Section 80061, Penal Code 11166(a), which requires that mandated reporters make a suspected child abuse report immediately or as soon as possible. While conducting an assignment related to the above incident, it was also discovered that the Licensee was out of compliance regarding staffing regulations. In an interview conducted, the Facility Manager stated that their regular working hours were from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. A review of the facility\u2019s LIC 500 Personnel Report indicated that the Facility Manager\u2019s working hours were between 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Interviews conducted with other staff and clients in the home confirmed that the Facility Manager\u2019s working hours were between 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and that the facility was generally without a Facility Manager between the hours of 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM unless an emergency incident required their presence. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, the Licensee is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards, STRTP, Article 6 Section 87065(f), which requires that a Facility Manager be present in the facility at all times when one or more clients are present.",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that in December of 2022, staff failed to properly supervise clients in care resulting in an unidentified, unauthorized female minor entering the facility undetected for an extended amount of time. During the course of this investigation, the female minor was not able to be located and was listed as a runaway. Therefore, an interview was unable to be obtained with her. In an interview conducted, one client stated that the unauthorized female minor (UFM) was snuck into the facility in the middle of the night towards the end of December 2022. The client stated that the UFM was brought in through a back bedroom window on the second floor of the facility. The client stated that prior to the UFM\u2019s unauthorized entry into the facility, security cameras had been covered with sticky notes and the bedroom window had been cracked open earlier in the day so that the sensor would not make an alert sound when it was later opened for UFM. The client stated that for the approximately 2 days that UFM was inside the facility, she was hidden from staff by hiding on the floor between a bedroom wall and bed. The only time she left the bedroom was to use the bathroom while staff were downstairs and performing other duties. Food was brought upstairs to her without the knowledge of staff. The client stated that staff generally conducted checks every 15 \u2013 30 minutes and would come upstairs into their rooms to see if clients needed anything. However, the UFM was able to avoid detection each time. In another interview conducted, a second client corroborated the above statements and stated that all of the clients that were present in the facility during that time period were aware that UFM was in the home but no one alerted staff. The client also admitted that they actively assisted in covering up cameras on at least one occasion with sticky notes. A third client stated that they were initially unaware that UFM was present in the facility but also confirmed that they did not alert staff when they were finally aware. In interviews conducted, staff confirmed after checking security footage that the UFM was brought into the facility in the middle of the night through a second-story bedroom window. Footage also showed clients temporarily covering up security cameras with sticky notes in order to facilitate UFM sneaking into the home. Staff stated that when clients are upstairs in their rooms, staff members will check on them every 15-30 minutes to see what they are up to and if they need anything. This also occurs during overnight shifts when clients are asleep. Staff stated that during the period of time when this incident occurred, they would make regular checks but they did not see UFM as she would hide on the side of the bed closest to the wall and under blankets. In an interview conducted, a third-party individual stated that all indications pointed towards clients actively assisting the UFM in entering the facility and avoiding detection.\n\nIt was also alleged that one client had access to a weapon in the facility. Further investigation revealed that the weapon in question was a CO2 BB gun. In an interview conducted, one client stated that it was brought into the facility unbeknownst to staff. A second client stated that they were unaware that the item was in the home until it was discovered and a third client stated that they were aware the first client had it in his possession, but decided not to alert staff to it. All clients stated that staff will ask to conduct searches when clients are returning from the community but stated that they sometimes refuse. Clients stated that room searches are conducted periodically by staff if there is reason to believe there may be contraband hidden. In interviews conducted, staff confirmed that they will ask to conduct light contraband searches on clients to include flipping out pockets, checking backpacks, having clients pat down their own pockets, and more. Clients will sometimes refuse, and when this occurs, staff will document the refusal. Staff stated that room searches are routinely conducted and the thoroughness of the check will depend on if there is a specific reason to believe that contraband may be hidden somewhere. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to suggest that the above allegations occurred. Although the allegations may be valid or may have happened, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegations are deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED. An exit interview was conducted and copy of this report was provided to the Licensee.",

S1 stated it was a safety concern, and waited for the supervisor to arrive and handle the situation. S2 stated that C1 wanted to call his uncle, to come to the facility to assault staff. S2 stated that C1 had his own cell phone at the time of the incident and was purposely causing an unnecessary argument. S2 also stated staff safety was a concern. S2 stated that C1 shortly after apologized for his behavior. C1 went on AWOL 5-9-25 and has not returned, not available for comment. LPA conducted document research. C1's needs and service plans show a history of violent assaultive behavior. The incident report and shift notes both indicate that C1 wanted to call an unauthorized person to come and assault staff.

    "narrative": "The LPA observed that the client was placed at the facility on March 5, 2020 and removed on September 30, 2021. The LPA observed an Appraisal/Needs and Services Plan dated October 1, 2020. The LPA observed that the County Placement Worker signed the document on January 20, 2021. The LPA observed a Quarterly Report dated September 17, 2021. The investigation revealed that the initial County Social Worker was no longer assigned the case. It is determined that the facility provided an Appraisal/Needs and Services Plan as required by the Plan of Operation. It is noted that the Appraisal/Needs and Services Plan is not within the 90 day plan, but consideration is given due to the Covid19 Pandemic. The LPA cannot corroborate that the facility did not provide paperwork. The investigation revealed that the facility was aware for two-to-three months of the plan to transfer Ref. #1 to an adult residential facility. It revealed that the facility had less than less than 24 hours to pack Ref. #1's belongings for the transfer once they received the call that a placement was open for Ref. #1. The LPA was provided inconsistent statements as to whether Ref. #1's belongings were provided in either a box or bags. It revealed that the witness stated a box, but no details were provided as to whether it was a moving box. The investigation revealed that the witness was concerned more with the lack of contents in the box as opposed to the container the belongings were transported in. The LPA cannot corroborate the allegation that Ref. #1's belongings were not provided. The LPA cannot corroborate evidence to determine if there was a Personal Rights violation based upon the type of container Ref. #1's belongings were transported. The LPA reviewed the Medical Treatment Record dated June 23, 2020 signed by the physician; and the Health and Education Passport dated February 16, 2021. The LPA cannot corroborate the allegation that the client was not taken to their medical appointment. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

The investigation revealed inconsistent statements regarding the request for communication from the facility. The investigation revealed statements that the facility was telephoned several times and messages were left regarding Ref. #1 being taken to the hospital. The statements alleged that Ref. #1's biological mother was contacted to reach the facility. The LFM disclosed that they received the telephone calls while in a meeting. The LFM disclosed that no message was left on the voicemail. It revealed that the LFM returned the call, but did not know who was calling. The LFM revealed that they received a telephone call at around 10:45 or 11 a.m. that Ref. #1 was being transported to the hospital by ambulance. The investigation revealed that the LFM met the client at the hospital. An interview with Ref. #1 revealed that the LFM had told Ref. #1 the morning of February 3 that they would take Ref. #1 to the hospital, but Ref. #1 did not tell the LFM that Ref. #1 wanted to go. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegations There was no preponderance of the evidence to substantiate the allegation.

A confidential interview and review of pertinent facility records revealed that during the outing, C1 and C2 engaged in an inappropriate conversation which led to C1 throwing sand at C2. A confidential interview and review of records confirmed that staff prompted both clients to stop, resulting in C1 becoming upset and punching C2. Confidential interviews and a review of pertinent facility records revealed that staff intervened by putting separation between clients and prompting both clients to stop, however, C1 proceeded to hit C2 a second time and C2 defended their self. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 was upset at staff intervening and was reported to be defiant in their behavior by arguing with staff. A confidential interview indicated that S1 used profanity when addressing C1, and one confidential interview confirmed that S1 used a profane word while in the proximity of C1.

Board Director's Meeting Notes - LPA Larios recently conducted a Law Enforcement (LE) inspection. LPA Larios reviewed the board of directors notes and noticed there was no evidence discussing LE contacts on SIRs. LPA Larios had a conversation and Jennifer Woolery will circle back and review the notes to make sure that was discussed and not missed during future meeting. 3. Program Statement - Updates needed to be based on newest version of STRTP ILS Version 3.1. - Section 17 of PS: Restitution program needs to be defined differently and not use restitution. Define it as clinical intervention, how it teaches other skills to clients in care, and go into detail of PS so it is a clearer picture. - Section 22 of PS: Needs to be more descriptive of how it is Trauma Informed and needs to be clear that it meets the needs of clients from 6-NMD.\n\n4. Review of SIRs - SIRs need to include the following: 1) What happened before and triggered the restraint of client, 2) what happened during the restraint, and 3) debrief of the incident (Follow up). - If same child is being restrained time and time again, there needs to be progress notes and treatment plan needs to be discussed or changed. - Need to add time of incident. - Need to have more clinical staff present for incidents regarding restraints. If they are present then it needs to be noted in SIR. - Claudia Rice mentioned that there needs to be more training for staff on how to write SIRs. Making sure full story content is detailed in the SIR. - In regards to belt pivot, include description of belt pivot, purpose of it and how it is used.

Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) has concerns with clients eventually seriously injuring themselves on the barbed wire located on the roof. Community Care Licensing (CCL) main concern with this is the health and safety for the youth in care. -Due to where the clinicians offices are located in the main building, clients are able to exit through the emergency exit and access the roof. RM Coleman requested pictures of campus where the barbed wire is located to have a better visual to assess the situation at hand. 2. Plan of Correction (POC) from October 2019 - A review of what was corrected from the Plan of Correction (POC) sent from Five Acres in October 2019. LPM Smith asked the following: Did Five Acres get permission to install barbed wire from CCL? Claudia Rice Division Director clarified that the barbed wire already existed on the roof and fence around the facility prior to POC in October 2019. Currently, there is barbed wire around the 10 foot fence that surrounds the campus and on the roof.\n\nAfter the virtual tour the following items were discussed to have a follow up regarding the barbed wire: - Five Acres collecting data to see how many injuries have occurred from the barbed wire on the roof. - Meeting with DCFS to discuss further action regarding clients getting injured from accessing the roof. - Brainstorming ideas to prevent clients from climbing on the roof where barbed wire is located. - Joint meeting with CCL, DCFS, and Five Acres to determine what will be done regarding the barbed wire on the roof.

The purpose of this visit was to deliver the findings for the above complaint allegations. During the course of the investigation, a total of four (4) clients and two (2) staff were interviewed. Interviews conducted confirmed there was not enough evidence to prove that a child was threatened by a staff member or staff member had another resident beat up child. Child 1 (C1) is known to be aggressive and has fought staff and clients when C1 was a resident at the facility. Staff 1 (S1) denied the allegations. S1 stated that C1 had fought a staff member and when a client saw, the client started to fight C1. S1 stated that C1 thought S1 had the client do so and apologized when realized it did not happen. County Social Worker (CSW) stated that C1 can be impulsive. Based on the interview information obtained and review of facility documentation, the allegation(s) are concluded as unsubstantiated meaning that although the allegation(s) may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. No deficiencies were observed or cited at the time of this investigation. Exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report will be emailed to the Administrator.",

It was also discovered that S1 had purchased gifts for C1. When confronted by facility Administration, S1 denied buying gifts or texting C1; however, facility obtained proof to support the claims that S1 was communicating with C1 and had purchased gifts for C1. On May 26, 2021, S1 was terminated from employment for reasons including, but not limited to, having inappropriate unauthorized communication and purchasing various gifts for C1. The Department has investigated the complaint and found that the allegation is Unsubstantiated at this time meaning, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove sexual abuse by S1 on C1. There were no deficiencies cited at this time.\n\nThe text messages contained messages alluding to inappropriate content by S1. It was further revealed that S1 had purchased various gifts for C1 that were against facility gift policy. An interview with S1 by CCL Investigator Seng revealed admission by S1 of sending text messages to C1 and purchasing various gifts for C1. Based on information obtained from interviews and documentary facts, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The Department has determined former staff member S1 engaged in inappropriate conduct with C1 while in care. The allegation is deemed substantiated at this time and thus poses potential Health, Safety or Personal Rights risk to children in care. The following citation is issued in accordance with the Health and Safety Code 1550(c) Conduct Inimical. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were discussed.

LPA was unable to substantiate the allegation that staff failed to prevent minor from harm while in care. Confidential interviews revealed that residents are supervised at all times but sometimes they may fall or hurt themselves while playing which is not always preventable. Confidential interviews also revealed that Client #1 (C1) did have a few scratches due to being \u201chyper\u201d and also \u201cbumped\u201d their chin during play which could not be prevented. LPA review of video footage determined that C1 appears to be \u201chyper\u201d and unable to control movements which could possibly result in injuries if not careful. LPA was unable to substantiate the allegation that staff failed to notify minor's authorized representative of incidents. Confidential interviews revealed that incidents are cross reported to all reporting agencies including C1\u2019s authorized representative. LPA was unable to substantiate the allegation that staff failed to safeguard minor\u2019s personal belongings. Although documentary evidence shows an inventory of C1\u2019s missing clothing items when C1 returned home from Five Acres, it did not reveal that staff failed to safeguard C1\u2019s personal belongings as it only reveals that clothing items can be lost, missing, or mixed up with other client belongings. It was also revealed that C1 would run out of the cottage with one shoe on which would result in a missing shoe. Confidential interviews did not reveal that staff did not meet C1\u2019s needs. Confidential interviews revealed that there was a misunderstanding by the parents of C1 of services being provided for C1. The parents of C1 were under the impression that staff would be providing a one-on-one for C1 and became upset with Five Acres with not being in agreement with what C1\u2019s diagnosis should be necessitating the need for C1 to have a one-on-one.

Staff made several efforts to re-direct minor\u2019s behavior. Documentary evidence revealed minor\u2019s behaviors consist of displaying poor boundaries which consist of inappropriate dances in front of male staff and not following directions. LPA obtained minor\u2019s Needs and Services Plan (NSP). Statements made during confidential interviews indicated minor became upset when staff tried to re-direct minor\u2019s inappropriate behavior and minor reported that staff \u201cbit\u201d minor. Inconsistent statements indicated minor was not bitten by staff. Documentary evidence obtained indicated minor had no visible bite marks present but more of an \u201cimprint\u201d due to minor leaning against something or from a clothing item. LPA obtained Special Incident Report (SIR) 825630 and facility illness/injury report for minor on the day of the incident. Based on the interviews conducted and documentary evidence, the information gathered did not produce corroborating evidence to support the above said allegations. LPA Edison was not able to determine if the above said allegations occurred, therefore the allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred. Based on the observations made during today\u2019s inspection, no deficiencies were cited per Title 22, Division 6, of the California Code of Regulations.

LPA asked if LIC500 is available upon demand and DD reports that it is not and is maintained by the human resources department. On 10/18/23, the Department received a Serious Incident Report (SIR) from the facility, reporting that a minor, C1, was not provided with prescribed medication due to staff being unable to locate medications. Missing medication was found during the next day and it was determined that LVN2 misplaced medication and did not follow facility policy for storing meds upon a client's return from a visit home. During the time of inspection, LPA O'Connell conducted investigative interviews with DD, LVN1, S1, S2, C2, and C3 [See LIC811, dated 10/26/23, for CONFIDENTIAL NAMES LIST]. Confidential interviews revealed that staff did not follow the facility policy to store medications after a client returns from a home visit. Further, it was determined that the facility does not have a clear documentation procedure related to tracking missed medication. During the investigation, LPA reviewed findings and observations with DD and retained pictures of evidence for Department records. PER California Code Regulation, there is one deficiency to be cited at this time. See LIC809D for details.

Consistent statements indicated that Client #2 (C2) was previously placed at Five Acres (Solita) but was no longer in placement. Documentary evidence indicate C2 AWOL\u2019d from current placement. LPA obtained Special Incident Report (SIR) #844753. Statements indicate C2 returned to Five Acres (Solita) with C1. Statements indicate that C2 climbed through the bedroom window which was left open. Statements indicated C1 had returned from AWOL and Pasadena Police Department was present at the facility when C2 was found by staff in the bedroom. Statements did not indicate facility staff are not adequately supervising minors. Documentary evidence indicates adequate direct care staff and client ratio on the date of the incident. LPA obtained email documentation from Division Director of staff schedule dated 2/17/2023-2/19/2023. Division Director stated that there is no paper documentation of staff schedule for the requested dates.

LPA observed C2 knock on the bedroom window. LPA observed someone opening the bedroom window and C2 climbed through the window. LPA was unable to identify who opened the window. Based on the interviews conducted, documentary evidence and LPA video footage review, the information gathered did not produce corroborating evidence to support the above said allegations. LPA was not able to determine if the above said allegations occurred, therefore the allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred.

Records indicate on February 18, 2024, Y1 suffered accidental injuries when hiding from staff and a door/closet closed on minor\u2019s thumb. Facility staff called 911 immediately upon occurrence and Y1was sent to the hospital for treatment. Information reviewed revealed no documentation of any suspicion of child abuse within the Medical Records. On June 19, 2024, Y1 sustained an injury (bruise on his genital area). Records reviewed revealed youth sustained the injury during an outing at the local park while riding their bike. Facility nurses completed an assessment of client's genital area after the incident. Client observed with bruising to scrotum area. Youth was offered an ice pack however client declined. Confidential interviews and review of documentary evidence including client file history produced a lack of evidence to prove allegations that staff physically abused Y1, resulting in severe injury or that staff did not prevent minor from being harmed by another minor. Evidence obtained was not sufficient to substantiate the allegations. Therefore, the allegations are determined Unsubstantiated. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. Exit interview completed. A copy of this report and LIC811 was provided to Facility Representative.",

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the youth sase plans, Crisis Safety Plan,Child and Family Team summary, Needs and Service Plan (LIC625), the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Rosas observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance with their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Tessa Koziol, Administrator.",

Specifically it was reported that S1 would purchase underwear for C1 on a weekly basis and made comments to C1 about getting C1 showered. Confidential interviews reported conflicting accounts on how purchases of personal items (ie. underwear) were made. Confidential interviews reported youth were given their clothing allowance and allowed to purchase needed/wanted items including underwear. Additional confidential interviews reported that staff assisted youth in making the purchases to ensure appropriate sizes were selected. However, it was also reported that S1 often frequently picked up various items from thrift shops and would provide these items to youth. It was unknown if these items included underwear. Confidential interviews and record review could not confirm or dispute the allegation. A third allegation alleging facility staff (unnamed) did not accord youth (Child #1 [C1]) privacy. Specifically it was reported on an unknown date, while in the shower C1 felt as though C1 was being watched. Confidential interviews reported facility protocol is the bathroom door is the only door in the facility that is permitted to be closed and/or locked to allow for privacy.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews mentioned an incident where C1 became upset with behavior escalating into self-harm and property destruction. During the incident C1 went outside of a cottage located at the facility and with a rock began to make scratches on their forearm. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 then attempted to reenter the cottage but was not allowed entrance into the cottage by staff members assigned to work in the cottage. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 became more upset when staff would not allow C1 entrance back into the cottage, so C1 threw a rock at the cottage glass window. Resulting in the breaking/shattering of the window. While C1 remained outside and not being allowed entry into the cottage, C1 picked up some broken glass, and began to cut their forearm with the shards of glass, while staff remained inside the cottage. Information provided indicated that staff contributed to C1 becoming unable to de-escalate and manage the self-harming behavior by remaining inside the cottage and not opening the entrance door, when C1 was attempting to re-enter the facility. Confidential interviews indicated that staff remained inside the cottage while using crisis communication through the window. LPA did not receive information regarding staff implementing a safety plan, following C1\u2019s needs and service plan, attending to C1\u2019s wounds, nor providing guidance to a safe area away from the broken glass. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that due to neglect, C1 sustained injuries while in care, staff did not prevent C1 from self-harming, staff are not properly supervising minors while in care, and staff did not provide a safe and comfortable environment for minors are SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews disclosed C1 and C2 had a \u201ccrush\u201d on each other. It was also stated during confidential interviews that C1 and C2 liked each other, and staff often had to separate them. Confidential interview indicated C1 and C2 resided in different cottages and, on one occasion, C1 was caught by staff going into C2\u2019s bedroom through the window after hours. Confidential interviews revealed C1 and C2 often disabled the window alarms by removing the battery from the alarm or removing the alarm from the window. Record review indicated windows were often replaced due to clients breaking them; however, the window alarms were not maintained, although interviews indicated that staff were aware that clients disabled or removed alarms. Record review indicated C1 and C2 interacted sexually on at least two occasions while in C1\u2019s bedroom. Record review indicated C2 admitted to having sex with C1 and being in a relationship with C1 when they were placed at the facility. The Department received consistent information regarding C1 and C2 having a sexual interaction while they were placed at the facility due to disabling the window alarms and staff not conducting frequent status checks on the clients. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegation that due to lack of care and supervision, minors engaged in inappropriate sexual activity while in care is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence has been met. This posed immediate Health, Safety, and Personal Rights risks to children in care. The facility will be cited for violating Title 22. Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 06. Continuing Requirements, Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision [See LIC 9099D]. An Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) determination is pending. If an ECP is assessed, a Community Care Licensing representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment.

On November 6, 2024, LPA Jauregui delivered an amended Complaint Investigation Report to the facility. The allegation that due to lack of care and supervision, minors engaged in inappropriate sexual activity while in care was substantiated. The investigation provided sufficient evidence that the minors engaged in inappropriate sexual activity on two occasions due to lack of supervision. The licensee was cited from Title 22 Regulations, Section 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (a) The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client\u2019s needs. Based on an analysis of the confidential interviews and documentation, the Department has determined that an ECP is warranted for the facility not ensuring that C1 and C2 were provided sufficient supervision to prevent C2 from entering C1\u2019s room and engaging in inappropriate sexual activity. Penal Code section 11165.1 defines sexual abuse as involuntary sexual penetration. Therefore, pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty Law, Health, and Safety Code section 1548(f)(1)(C), the Department will be issuing an immediate Civil Penalty of $2,500.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights were discussed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List, and the Civil Penalty Assessment-Serious Bodily Injury/Sexual Abuse (Form 421-D) were provided to Erica Rowan, Residential Supervisor.

The purpose of the inspection was to complete the continuation inspection for STRTP annual inspection that was initiated on June 22, 2021. LPA already completed the physical inspection of the facility and reviewed facility client files on the first day of the annual inspection. During this annual inspection continuation, LPA Escobar reviewed ten personnel files to ensure they contained all required documentation per Title 22 Regulations and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS). Personnel Files are usually maintained in a locked closet by the front door. All appropriate personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. Ten of the ten files that were reviewed were for employees who converted from group home personnel to STRTP personnel. LPA observed the converted staff members were trained according to the STRTP training requirements. Files for staff 5 (S5) and staff 8 (S8) did not have a copy of driver's license. Staff 1 (S1), staff 2 (S2), and staff 10 (S10) did not have proof of TB test. S10 and staff 7 (S7) files did not have education verification. S5 and staff 6 (S6) did not have signed employee rights. S1, S2, and S10, did not have updated job descriptions. S5 and S6 did not have job descriptions. S8 and S10 did not have current job evaluations and S7 did not have one in file.

    "narrative": "On June 22, 2021 at 9:05 AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carmen Escobar arrived at Future Stars Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP). LPA was greeted and granted access by Ms. Ronnie Lusk. The purpose of the visit is to conduct an annual inspection of the facility. There were two staff and five clients present at the time of the inspection. Appropriate staff/client ratios were verified during the inspection, however, no facility manager was on site at the time of the inspection. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards chapter section 87065, Personnel Requirements. No facility manager was available to arrive at the facility during the time LPA conducted the inspection. At 9:15 AM, Ronnie Lusk led the physical inspection of the facility. The facility consists of three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The facility has a small dining area, kitchen area, living room, open common area, laundry room, and a garage. The facility has a clinician's office for therapeutic services. Staff areas are located in the open common area as well as a corner of the main living room. All bedrooms have individual beds and drawer space for each client. The facility ensures that there is one client per bed with appropriate linens, pillows, comforters, and mattresses in good repair. Facility grounds are clean and free of debris and observable hazards. During the inspection, it was observed that the basketball hoop in the backyard has fallen over and is on the ground, creating a potential hazard. It was also observed that the outside of the garage wall has white graffiti/markings that need to be painted over. There is adequate indoor and outdoor activity space. Books, crafts, movies, and other activities, were observed for client\u2019s recreation time. The client's bedroom windows were also missing screens. Carbon monoxide detector is in appropriate working order, and per staff, all facility smoke detectors are also in working order, however, this could not be verified as fire system is hard-wired into the home with standard fire alarms and fire alarm handles available for use during an emergency. Fire extinguisher is properly charged and serviced. The facility maintains an adequate supply of perishable and non-perishable foods and appears to be following the posted menu. All required forms are posted including the Grievance Procedures,\n\nVisitation Policies, Personal Rights form, and Foster Care Ombudsman poster. There was no activities calendar posted in the facility. Medications are locked and centrally stored in a locked closet near the front door. The hot water in the kitchen was deemed to be at a safe temperature. Per facility staff, no firearms or weapons are allowed in the facility. Facility appears to be meeting the terms and conditions of the license. Chemicals and/or poisons are locked in a cabinet in a restroom by the kitchen/garage area. Sharp objects are locked and stored in the locked closet by the front door/common area. First Aid Kits are also stored in the staff area and are complete, however, a First Aid Manual was unavailable.

Facility has not yet obtained Mental Health Certification, however, have submitted the application and are awaiting approval. Facility has obtained National Accreditation through CARF effective through September 30, 2023. Currently, there is a balance of $227 in Licensing fees for the facility. At 9:55 AM, five of five client files were reviewed during time of inspection. Client 1 (C1), client 2 (C2), client 3 (C3), client 4 (C4) and client 5's (C5) (See Confidential Names List (LIC 811) dated June 22, 2021, needs and service plans were not up to date.

C1-C5 did not have a signed copy of removal/discharge procedures, the facility complaint/grievance process, signed house discipline/rules, and C1 and C4 did not have an updated EIP. Additionally, all clients did not have a current allowance log or current inventory log. LPA Escobar requested that the current needs and service plans, immunization records, signed facility policies, and updated logs aforementioned, be sent to LPA Escobar as soon as possible. Currently there are four clients on medication. There are no observable current JV220 forms for C1, C3, C4, and C5. LPA requested copies of current JV220s also be sent to LPA Escobar. Technical Assistance Advisory Notes (TA) will be issued. LPAs conducted client interviews. Clients indicated that their basic needs are being met at the facility and core services being provided as well. LPA Escobar began the review of staff files, however, due to time constraints, was not able to conclude the review. LPA Escobar will return to complete staff file review and interviews at a later date.

While two witnesses maintain this is true, S1 denies calling C1 \u201cbitch\u201d and also denies threatening C1. Confidential interviews revealed a verbal altercation occurred between S1 and C1 at the facility. A couple of witnesses report hearing S1 call C1 a \u201cbitch\u201d and also verbally threaten C1, saying something along the lines of, \u201cYou must not know who you\u2019re talking to. I\u2019m about to slap those glasses off your face!\u201d and \u201cShut the fuck up before I choke you!\u201d to C1 during verbal altercation between S1 and C1. A witness maintains this was said by S1 as S1 was about 1-2 inches from C1\u2019s face. Another party states though they did not visually witness this occur, they heard S1\u2019s comments and remarks which corroborate what was reported. A couple of witness observed C1 being emotionally distraught due to the verbal altercation involving S1 and what was allegedly said by S1. S1 denies getting loud or yelling at C1. Several other statements corroborate this did occur. S1 was unable to articulate what trauma informed care/service was provided to C1 during this incident, S1 simply denied both allegations. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that S1 spoke inappropriately to C1 and S1 threatened C1 are SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for the allegations. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Interim Licensing Standards section 87072 Personal Rights. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were provided to Facility Manager, Iyonna Matthews, for signature.",

Additionally, a confidential witness interview reported that C1 was driven to the facility by hospital staff at 10:40 PM and dropped off at the facility. Confidential documents obtained as part of the investigation show that C1 was discharged and transported back to the facility by the hospital. Per review of the facility Program Statement/Plan of Operation regarding transportation arrangements, it states the following: \u201cFuture Stars Youth Services Inc stipulates that the staff on duty and that is on call are mainly responsible for children and non-minor dependents transportation when needed.\u201d Additionally, a confidential interview reported that the facility vehicle was on site the night C1 was returned to the facility by hospital staff and confirmed that C1 was not picked up by facility staff. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met based on confidential interviews and document reviews. Staff did not provide transportation to a minor (C1), resulting in the minor (C1) being left at the hospital. Therefore, the allegation is substantiated. The Department has determined that the licensee did not follow their program statement, specifically the terms regarding the transportation arrangements for clients in care. The facility is cited for violation of California Code of Regulations Title 22, Division 6 Plan of Operation, 80022(a)(b)(10)(k). (a) Each licensee shall have and maintain on file a current, written, definitive plan of operation. (b) The plan and related materials shall contain the following (10) Transportation arrangements for clients who do not have independent arrangements (k) The facility shall operate in accordance with the terms specified in the Plan of Operation and may be cited for not doing so.

It was unclear whether the staff (S1 and S2) used or did not use restraint, and rather the incident report that the Department received was missing some information regarding restraint.

Confidential interviews disclosed that parental controls were installed unknowingly, and when S2 became aware of the situation, C1\u2019s cell phone was factory reset. In addition, information obtained as part of the investigation shows that in order for the parental control application to be effective, S2 would need to install the application on their personal cellular device to monitor C1\u2019s cell phone activity. Moreover, a confidential interview denied that S2 had parental control applications installed on their (S2\u2019s) personal or business cell phones.

The department also received an allegation that staff (S1) had inappropriate conversations with a minor (C2), and staff did not safeguard a minor's (C2) personal belongings. It was reported that C4 took C2's cell phone and found phone calls between S1 and C2. More specifically, it was alleged that the phone calls between S1 and C2 were exchanged outside of S1's regular working hours. A confidential interview witness interview reported C4 found text messages exchanged between S1 and C2. The confidential witness did not see the text messages and learned, second hand, from C4 that S1 offered C2 money to spy on other clients and a STRTP staff. LPA received inconsistent information to support the alleged misconduct. Although it was reported that S1 had inappropriate phone conversations with C2, LPA did not obtain additional statements from those who saw the text messages or witnessed the phone calls between S1 and C2. Other confidential interviews either denied the allegation or denied having any knowledge of S1 contacting C2 or other clients after hours to spy on clients and staff. In addition, confidential interviews disclosed that C1 did have S2's phone number. However, conversations between C1 and S2 were not inappropriate. C2 only contacted S1 when C2's roommate was \"upset,\" or other clients were \"out of control.\" Information from confidential interviews also reported that S2 was a good employee, and there were no concerns about S1's interaction with clients. Regarding the allegation, the staff did not safeguard C2's belongings, and LPA again received conflicting information to prove the allegation. A confidential interview denied that C2's cell phone was taken by C4 or any other clients in care. Another confidential interview reported that clients stole from each other but did not recall the alleged theft of C2's cell phone. Other confidential interviews reported clients could keep their items in the staff office and had access to personal lockers to store their property. Furthermore, a confidential interview reported that at the time C2 was in care, there were no reports of theft. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegations Staff (S2) yelled at minor (C3), staff (S1) had inappropriate conversations with minor (C2), and staff did not safeguard minors (C2's) personal belongings are unsubstantiated.

S4 states that C1 did not want to go to the ER because of the wait so S4 advised staff to give him Ibuprofen and to use the first aid kit and put a splint on his hand.

S4 states that C1 felt content knowing he would have an appointment with his doctor. C1 was seen on March 15, 2023, and had X-rays done which showed his right hand to be fractured.

The purpose of the visit was to follow-up an incident reported to the Department on 08/18/2022 regarding a client (C1) who disclosed to facility staff that she snorted the medication administered to her on the night of 08/13/22. C1 also disclosed that she deliberately hid her medication between her lips and teeth, and then passed on the medication to another client C2 who admitted to snorting the medication on the night of 08/14/22 (see Confidential Names List LIC811 dated 09/09/22). During the inspection, LPA Silva conducted a tour of the facility, interviewed Head of Service regarding medication administration procedure, and reviewed clients' medication vs. medication records. LPA also interviewed four (4) staff members via telephone prior to today's inspection. All five (5) staff members confirmed that the facility\u2019s protocol on medication administration is that clients take their medications in staff\u2019s presence and that clients cough, blow and hold open their mouth and lift their tongue to ensure that medication was taken and swallowed. Based on interviews, staff S1 followed correct medication administration procedure. Staff is unsure of how C1 managed to hide and not swallow the medications she took on the nights of 08/13/22 and 08/14/22. Interviews with staff indicated that all staff who assist clients in medication administration received the proper medication training. Staff training on medication is given during initial training and is also part of their annual and in-service training. Interviews also indicated that additional training was given to staff members after the incident to ensure careful medication distribution and to prevent similar incidents from occurring. During medications vs. records review, LPA observed that C1 had missed doses of her medication but are not documented or explained on the Psychotropic Medication Administration Record (PMAR). A deficiency citation is issued , see LIC809D.. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, LIC809D, LIC811 and appeal rights were provided to the facility representative.",

Confidential interviews reveal that an emergency CFT Meeting was held on 10/3/22 to preserve client\u2019s placement. Client was in attendance and the emergency CFT meeting notes state in part that, \u201cthe identified client continues to meet criteria for placement in an STRTP and the level of care provided.\u201d However, a 14-day notice of request for removal was submitted by the facility on the same day, without client\u2019s knowledge. Staff explained that client was not informed of the removal request for client\u2019s own safety and that it\u2019s the policy of the facility not to inform clients of any planned removal for safety reasons. Staff explained that client was unable to commit to safety. There was no record found of any incident or safety issues involving the client during and after the CFT meeting to indicate the need for a removal request. There was no record found that the removal request was discussed with the client. The client\u2019s NSP was not updated prior to the removal request. There was no record found showing that the client was offered an opportunity in the development of any transfer plan. The client became aware of the removal request after being informed by the client\u2019s legal team during a scheduled court hearing. The client\u2019s legal team informed staff of the need to speak to the client prior to the scheduled court hearing. The client\u2019s legal team made several attempts to speak to the client, by phone calls and emails to staff, before and after the client\u2019s court date. All attempts to speak to the client, through staff and the facility, were unsuccessful. There was no record found that client refused to speak to the legal team. Based on information obtained from confidential interviews and records obtained, the allegations are substantiated, based on the preponderance of evidence. The following deficiency citations are issued under STRTP Interim Licensing Standards \u2013 87068.4(e)(2)(E)(1) and 87068.4(e)(2)(D) Removal and/or Transfer Procedures and 87072(c)(4) Personal Rights. These violations pose an immediate and/or potential Health, Safety, or Personal Rights risk to clients in care. A Plan of Correction was discussed with the facility representative. Copies of the following were provided at the conclusion of the inspection: LIC 9099, LIC 9099-C, LIC 9099-D and LIC 811 Confidential Names dated 5/4/23. Appeal rights forms were provided and explained.\n\nIt was alleged that staff did not ensure sharp objects were inaccessible to client and staff did not provide client\u2019s record to authorized person. Confidential interviews reveal that client had access to a compact mirror, which was an age and developmentally appropriate personal item used for grooming and make up. Although client has a history of self injurious behavior, there was no record found that such item was prohibited. Client used the compact mirror to engage in self injurious behavior while inside the bathroom, resulting in hospitalization. The client\u2019s safety/crisis intervention plan was updated after the incident. Regarding the request for client\u2019s record, the document not immediately provided by staff who explained to the requestor that information was being added to the document. The document was provided after a week. There was no evidence found that the facility refused to provide or was withholding client\u2019s record.

Confidential interviews disclosed that all shifts are not covered properly; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that there are two to three staff scheduled per shift. In addition, confidential interviews revealed that STRTP utilizes the 3:1 ratio at the STRTP as stated in the STRTP\u2019s program statement. Confidential interviews also revealed that none of the clients have missed any medical or court appointment due to staffing. If a client missed an appointment it was due to the client refusing to go to an appointment. Confidential interviews also revealed that all clients\u2019 needs are being met and clients are taken to shop for necessities. Confidential interviews disclosed to LPA that the facility is cleaned daily, deep cleaning is done on Fridays and Saturdays and facility does not have an issue with cleanliness. LPA Hamilton conducted a health and safety tele-inspection on 10/01/2020 and did not observe any issues regarding the cleanliness of the STRTP. It was also alleged that Staff #2 (S2) worked from 3am on 09/20/2020 to 10pm on 09/21/2020. Confidential interviews and document review disclosed that S2 did work from 3:30am 09/20/2020 to 10pm on 09/20/2020 due to two other staff not reporting for their scheduled shifts. S2 worked along with Staff #1 who came in from 9am \u2013 10pm and STRTP was working within the correct ratio.

During this inspection, 5 out of 23 Direct Care Staff and 6 out of 6 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 23 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 6 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, 5/9/24). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, and Crisis Intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Canal observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Georgina Doyle and Program Director Adrianna Vermilion.",

In addition, S1 admitted to being in the backyard while the clients engaged in marijuana use and acknowledged they (S1) did not dispose of the marijuana. Instead, S1 reported they (S1) passed the marijuana back to the client smoking and provided no reason for their (S1\u2019s) inaction. Additionally, the investigation revealed that staff informed the Administrator of S1\u2019s conduct, but the Administrator did not immediately report the incident to the Program Director. Information from confidential interviews further reported the STRTP conducted an internal investigation; after a review of the facility cameras, screen shots of those images were provided to LPA, a client was observed smoking, not S1. The internal investigation noted staff (S1-S3) violated the facility policy regarding \u201cappropriate supervision of youth\u201d and failed to submit a Special Incident Report. Furthermore, a confidential interview reported that S1\u2019s employment was terminated when another client at the other facility located at 25123 Middlebrook Way, Moreno Valley, CA 92555, alleged and later recanted that S1 provided clients with pills and marijuana. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegation staff was contributing marijuana to the delinquency of minors is substantiated; the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The facility is cited with a violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS )87065.2 (b)(1) Personnel Duties (b) Direct care staff shall perform the following duties (1) supervision, protection, and care of children at all times, individually and in groups.

Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that staff have had to work shifts alone if another staff calls off or quits but this does not happen often; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that this STRTP does not have an issue with staffing or staff calling off causing staff to work over their shift. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided regarding clients missing appointments due to staffing. Confidential interviews disclosed that Client #3 may have missed an appointment due to staffing; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that none of the clients have missed any appointments due to staffing. In regard to the allegation that the food served to clients is not of the quality nor quantity to meet the clients\u2019 needs, it was alleged that the food purchased for the facility is cheap and does not taste good. It was also alleged that there is not enough food to satisfy the clients\u2019 hunger. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that there is always enough food in the facility and that shopping is done weekly by the administrator. In addition, if the STRTP needs something the administrator will purchase it from the store, or have it delivered. Confidential interviews also revealed that the clients are provided three meals per day and snacks. Also, clients are able to prepare food if necessary and have access to food at all times. Confidential interviews revealed that the STRTP is provided with frozen turkey rolls (turkey with stuffing in the middle) from the Department of Education free lunch program. During the tele-inspection on 10/01/2020, LPA Hamilton observed the cabinets, refrigerator and freezers to be adequately stocked. Other confidential interviews disclosed that sometimes there is not enough food in the STRTP and that staff may have to go to the other site to get food. Also, during the tele-inspection LPA did not observe any expired foods. A confidential interview also revealed that clients wish for name brand foods. In regard to the allegation that the facility is not being cleaned regularly, it was alleged that due to lack of staffing the facility is not being cleaned regularly. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that the cleaning of the STRTP has suffered due to lack of staffing; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed to LPA that the facility is cleaned daily, deep cleaning is done on Fridays and Saturdays and facility does not have an issue with cleanliness. LPA Hamilton conducted a health and safety tele-inspection on 10/01/2020 and did not observe any issues regarding the cleanliness of the STRTP.\n\nIn regard to the allegation that the facility van is not in good repair, it was alleged that the van is in bad shape, the check engine light is on, runs rough, and is worn and dirty inside. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that van makes noise and slows down while driving it; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that the van has been recently repaired, is kept clean and receives maintenance regularly. Also, confidential interviews and document review revealed that van had recently been vandalized by clients and has received the required maintenance. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations that the facility has insufficient staffing to meet clients\u2019 needs, the food served to clients is not of the quality nor quantity to meet the clients\u2019 needs, the facility is not being cleaned regularly and the facility vehicle is not in good repair, may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence.

Confidential interviews and document review revealed that C1\u2019s CSW was made aware of the incident 12/10/2020 via an outside party and CCL was notified on 12/11/2020 when the allegations were received via a complaint report. In addition, the Special Incident Report (SIR) dated 12/08/2020 regarding C3\u2019s attempted suicide was not sent to C1\u2019s CSW and LPA Hamilton until 12/15/2020. Administrator stated that she was aware of the client being 5150\u2019d on 12/08/2020 but was not aware that it was due to client attempting suicide. The Administrator did not learn of the attempted suicide until C3\u2019s IEP meeting on 12/08/2020 at 2pm. Administrator also stated the SIR was completed on 12/08/2020 but she was not included on the email and the SIR had only been sent to the acting facility manager after the incident. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined that the staff did not properly report an incident involving C3. The allegation is therefore substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 06 Section 80061(b)(1)(E): Reporting Requirements. The facility failed to report to CCL and C1\u2019s CSW/authorized representative an incident of self-harming within the timeframes outlined in Title 22 Regulations.

Confidential interviews revealed additional conflicting information stating that S2 was upstairs as C3 was attempting to harm self; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that S2 was downstairs. A Confidential interview disclosed that S2 was in the upstairs restroom at the time of the incident tending to an injury and another client was able to remove the curtain from around C3\u2019s neck just prior to S2 entering the bedroom. Confidential interviews disclosed that once S2 was in the bedroom, S2 was briefed by the other clients as to what had transpired with C3. Confidential interviews disclosed that S2 did call 9-1-1 as well as another client in the facility. Document review disclosed that S2 did not witness C3 with anything around C3\u2019s neck. CSWs had no issues or concerns with the care and supervision provided at the facility. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegation that S2 did not protect C3 from harm while in care, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence.

Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Hamilton conducted a case management tele-inspection for Guiding Light Home for Boys #2 (STRTP) and met with Administrator Shugella Weaver-Thomas via Facetime. Due to COVID-19 a tele-inspection was conducted. The purpose of the inspection was to address issues and concerns regarding incidents that occurred on or around October 28, 2020 and December 15, 2020. It was discovered through information received via confidential interviews that Client #1 (C1) was pushed by Staff #4 (S4) at the STRTP on 10/28/2020 when C1 became upset because S4 did not allow C1 to cook food at 1:00 AM. C1 began to destroy items in the STRTP. It was reported that S4 observed C1 heading towards the fire extinguisher, S4 jumped in front of the fire extinguisher and pushed the side of C1\u2019s shoulder. S4 pushed C1 to prevent C1 from retrieving the facility\u2019s fire extinguisher. The facility is being cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1 (09/16/2020), Section 87072(d)(10) Personal Rights. Per confidential interviews, S4 pushed C1. This poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk to children in care. It was further discovered through confidential interviews that on 12/15/2020, the facility was out of ratio. It was reported that on this date at 3:00 PM, there were two staff on duty at the STRTP with six clients. One staff left the facility with one client going to the hospital at 3:35 PM. This staff did not return to the facility until 7:51 PM and left again at 8:55PM to go back to the hospital to supervise C1. During the time the staff was away from the facility, the facility was not operating within the direct care staff/child ratio as stated in the STRTP Interim Licensing Standards. One staff was left to supervise and manage four clients between the hours of 6:30 PM to 7:51 PM and five clients from 8:55 PM \u2013 10:00 PM. Therefore, the STRTP is being cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1 (09/16/2020), Section 87065.5 (a)(1) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios. Per confidential interviews, the STRTP did not ensure the STRTP was properly staffed with the correct Staff/Child ratio during the above\n\nlisted time frames.

Confidential interviews disclosed that S4 bumped into C1, C1 pushed S4 and then S4 put C1 into a chokehold; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed S4 did not strangle or put C1 into a choke hold. Confidential interview did reveal that S4 did push the side of C1\u2019s shoulder as C1 was trying to get access to the facility\u2019s fire extinguisher as C1 was causing damage throughout the facility. In regard to the allegation that S5 harassed C1, it was alleged that S5 verbally harassed C1. A confidential interview disclosed that S5 told C1 \u201cyou should be in jail not a group home\u201d. S5 denied the allegation. Other confidential interviews disclosed that C1 and the other clients in the STRTP have never been verbally harassed by staff. In regard to the allegation that staff did not seek medical attention for C1, it was alleged that on December 15, 2020, C1 reported to the STRTP staff that C1 did not feel well and C1 had to call an ambulance for self. Confidential interviews and document review disclosed that C1 advised staff at 4:45 PM on 12/15/2020 that C1 wanted to go to the hospital but ignored staff when staff inquired why. C1 then requested staff call an ambulance at 5:15 PM and staff assessed that C1 had no life-threatening symptoms or needs. At 5:18 PM, C1 advised the staff on duty that C1 was feeling really sick and may have COVID-19 and C1 then used another client\u2019s phone to call an ambulance. Confidential interviews and document review revealed that the STRTP did not have sufficient staff or transportation to transport C1 to the hospital at the time of C1\u2019s request. There were two staff on duty and one staff had taken another client for medical attention at 3:37 PM. Confidential interviews disclosed that C1 was advised of this information and that C1 would have to wait for staff to return and then be taken to the hospital. CSW had no issues or concerns with the care and supervision provided at the facility. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations that S4 strangled C1, S5 harassed C1 and staff did not seek medical attention for C1 may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were emailed to Administrator, Shugella Weaver-Thomas for signature.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews also confirmed that the door was nailed shut because the licensee did not want clients out on the balcony due to a possible liability to the facility. Confidential interviews also disclosed that the balcony was stable but there was a possibility someone could get hurt. LPA observed pictures of facility maintenance removing the screw from the track of the sliding glass door on 03/10/2021 and the door being opened. In addition, LPA conducted a health and safety tele-inspection via Microsoft Teams on 03/18/2021 and staff demonstrated that the sliding glass door in the master bedroom was able to be opened and closed. Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined that the facility did not ensure the sliding glass door in C1\u2019s bedroom was free from obstruction. The allegation is therefore substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 7 Section 80087(c): Building and Grounds: All outdoor and indoor passageways, stairways, inclines, ramps, open porches and other areas of potential hazard shall be kept free of obstruction. This poses immediate and potential health, safety or personal rights risk to children in care. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to facility manager.\n\nIn regard to the allegation that the facility lacks sufficient food for clients, on 03/05/2021 it was alleged that the facility only had butter and condiments in the refrigerator and frozen corndogs and banquet meals for weekend staff in the overflow freezer. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that the facility did not lack food and there were additional refrigerators and freezers full of food; whereas another confidential interview disclosed the facility did lack food sometimes. Confidential interviews also disclosed to LPA that the facility would advise ADM when food was low, ADM would do an Insta-Cart order and food would be delivered in approximately one to two days. Confidential interviews also disclosed that the facility also had an overflow refrigerator and freezer at Site 1, located at 26624 Saffron Cir, Moreno Valley, CA 92555 due to that site having more space for the extra refrigerators and freezers. LPA observed pictures were taken at the facility showing the refrigerators and cabinets lacked food and receipts of the food purchased that same day. LPA Hamilton conducted a health and safety tele-inspection via Microsoft Teams on 03/18/2021 and observed additional refrigerators and freezers with plenty of food. Furthermore, on 03/18/2021 County of San Bernardino Open Complaint Investigator (OCI) conducted an unannounced facility inspection and did not observe any shortage of food according to their Investigative Narrative. In regard to the allegation that the facility does not provide a comfortable environment for C1, it was alleged that C1\u2019s bedroom had no ventilation and was stuffy due to the sliding glass door being nailed shut. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that all clients were comfortable in the facility and there were no complaints regarding the environment; whereas another confidential interview disclosed that both staff and clients are uncomfortable in the facility due to the heat. In regard to the allegation that the facility windows lack screens, it was alleged that on 03/08/2021 there were no window screens on any of the facility\u2019s upstairs windows. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that the screens staying on the client windows was an issue due to the clients going out on the roof to smoke; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed to LPA that all the facility windows have screens. LPA also observed a picture that was taken of a window at the facility that did not have a screen. LPA Hamilton conducted a health and safety tele-inspection on 03/18/2021 and did not observe any missing window screens. Moreover, on 03/18/2021 County of San Bernardino Open Complaint Investigator (OCI) conducted an unannounced facility inspection and observed screens on all bedroom windows and a sliding glass door.\n\nBased on confidential interviews, observations and document review, the allegations that the facility lacks sufficient food for residents, facility does not provide a comfortable environment for C1 and the facility windows lack screens, may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were provided to facility manager.",

    "narrative": "CSW disclosed that she had not been notified of C1\u2019s AWOL status prior to arriving at STRTP. CSW also disclosed to LPA on April 14, 2021 that CSW still had not received a copy of the Special Incident Report (SIR) regarding C1\u2019s AWOL. Records review revealed that the SIR was prepared by STRTP staff on April 09, 2021 and reviewed and approved by previous Administrator (ADM) on April 1 ,2021. Confidential interviews disclosed that the staff who prepared the report did not follow the STRTP\u2019s protocol to notify the client\u2019s authorized representative directly or call the county\u2019s hotline. ADM disclosed the SIR was sent to CSW and CCL on the morning of April 15, 2021. CSW also advised LPA that CSW was not notified of C1\u2019s return to the STRPT on April 6, 2021 until CSW contacted the STRTP via telephone on April 12, 2021. Confidential interviews disclosed the STRTP\u2019s protocol is for staff writing the SIR to make notifications to CCL, CSW/authorized representative, law enforcement and STRTP management. CSW added that the facility has previously failed to notify CSW timely of C1\u2019s AWOL status. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined that facility staff did not properly report C1\u2019s AWOL to C1\u2019s authorized representative. The allegation is therefore substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6 Section 80061(g): Reporting Requirements. The facility failed to report to C1\u2019s CSW/authorized representative that C1 had AWOL\u2019d from the STRTP within the timeframes outlined in Title 22 Regulations. This poses a potential health, safety or personal rights risk to children in care. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to Administrator Georgina Doyle.",

The physical altercation began in the clients shared bedroom and continued into the back yard area. It is unclear as to the physical contact made by either X1 or X2 prior to the arrival of staff inside the bedroom. X1 was diagnosed by a physician with a head injury requiring Sleep Monitoring. X2 required law enforcement intervention resulting in an arrest. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, GOY initiated a health and safety plan to honor the Center for Disease Control and California state government mandates. The order to refrain from utilizing or engage in physical intervention as outlined in the Pro-Act training became effective for staff on March 13, 2020. However, alternative safety measures were unsuccessful in maintaining the health and safety of clients in care as it relates to the aforementioned allegation. Based on the confidential interviews conducted and the information reviewed during the investigation process, the above allegation is substantiated meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met.

Interviews conducted revealed C1 denied distributing meth to any of the clients at the facility. C1 acknowledged using meth prior to being placed at the facility. However, C1 denied possessing meth during the time C1 was placed at the facility except for one occasion at a party C1 attended during a time C1 was AWOLed (absent without permission). Other clients denied using any illegal drugs at the facility or having any knowledge of any of the clients possessing or using illegal drugs. However, C2 admitted to using meth at the facility that was given to C2 by C1. Interviews revealed both C1 and C2 used meth in their room they shared at the facility. Interviews further revealed that meth was difficult to detect by the facility staff because there is no distinct odor. It was revealed that it is difficult for staff members to always detect drugs used at the facility in general due to their facility policy of not being able to search the client\u2019s personal belongings or their person for contraband. It was revealed while staff members do what they can according to facility policy, staff are not always able to recover contraband from the clients because the clients must consent to the searches. Clients admitted they do not always consent to the searches. Interviews further revealed staff members perform routine unannounced room checks at the facility. However, the clients acknowledged that the staff are not always able to find contraband because the clients hide it very well. A review of incident report dated 03/28/2021 reveals reported substance abuse, harm to self and hospitalization concerning C2 occurring during a home pass as C2 admitted to having plans with C1 to obtain meth with the intent to smoke enough to overdose. C2 was taken to the hospital for evaluation and released to a higher level of care. On 04/06/2021, a 14-day notice of removal was issued for C1. During the investigation there was no active criminal case by the local Police Department regarding the alleged distribution of meth at the facility. Information obtained revealed former resident C1 was cited for possession of meth following C1\u2019s placement at the facility. Based on information obtained during the investigation, the finding for neglect/lack of supervision is deemed Unsubstantiated meaning, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove a violation occurred. There were no deficiencies cited at this time. Exit interview conducted. Copy of this Report sent via email to Dr. Sultanian, Head of Service.",

On 11/20/2020 LPA Segura and Jess Macintire counted pills that should be left by reviewing the centrally stored log and medication administration log submitted. At approximately 11:30am LPA and Jess Macintire found that the Centrally Stored log for C1's medication could not account for the amount of pills for Medication 1 (M1, See confidential name list dated 11/24/2020). The Centrally stored log indicated that M1 is a 30 pill bottle started on the 14th of November which should result with 24 pills being present in the bottle. The actual count was 26 pills, it is an extra two pills, which could not be accounted for by reviewing the PMAR for missed meds or refusals. The count for Medication 2 was correct, no irregularity was found. On 11/24 LPA Segura called the administrator to revisit the medication count and found that C1 had refused medication on 11/17; which means there is one extra pill. On 11/20/20 A count was conducted for C2 as well at around 12:00pm. The count for Medication 2 was found to be correct. However, the count for Medication 1 for C2 did not add up initially and suspected missing medication. On 11/24 at around 11:50am LPA Segura spoke with Continued on 809C\n\nAdministrator Noelle Kinder and LPA Segura recounted pills and the centrally stored medication record was reviewed. LPA Segura and Administrator Kinder detected the error made in counting the medication on 11/20 was that it was erroneously believed to be a 30 pill bottle; however, it was actually a 14 pill bottle. Count made today 11/24 resulted in a correct pill count. Per Title 22 Regulations, deficiencies were cited during this inspection.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on emergency intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their emergency intervention plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Noelle Kinder",

Supervisor stated Client #5 threw the apple, but stated it was an accident. Supervisor stated she thought the apple only hit the fence. Confidential interviews stated Client #5 did throw the apple, but it was an accident. Information obtained stated it was also believed that the apple hit the fence. It was advised that a staff member was inside the facility in the kitchen area. Confidential interviews had conflicting stories regarding the supervision. The facility is approved to have surveillance cameras. LPA Harris requested and reviewed the surveillance camera footage with Administrator, Daniel Park. LPA Harris observed Client #2 and Client #5 outside in the backyard, by themselves. Client #5 had an object in his hand and was making a throwing motion. Client #5 entered the facility and came back outside and made another throwing motion. The footage on the inside of the facility showed no staff member at the door as advised. The Supervisor enters the frame after the two clients returned into the facility. Based on interviews and surveillance footage, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove facility staff are not adequately supervising youth. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated at this time. This poses a health, safety, and/or personal rights risk to the foster children in care.

    "narrative": "On May 3, 2021, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Regina Martin conducted a Case - Management Incident inspection via Microsoft Teams Meeting to deliver and discuss findings from the Department\u2019s Investigation on self-reported incident SIR #710958, dated August 8, 2020. LPA met with Daisy Delgado, Director of Residential Programs. On August 9, 2020, Community Care Licensing received an incident report reporting assaultive behavior by Staff #1 (S1) on Client #1 (C1). It was reported in part, that S1 and C1 were involved in a physical altercation resulting in injury to C1. The incident was referred and assigned to Investigations Branch, Investigator, Dennis Seng. The investigation including confidential interviews, review of related records and review of facility video surveillance footage revealed evidence to support physical abuse by S1 on C1. On August 8, 2020, during an altercation outside of the facility Cottage, C1 became upset that S1 confiscated a portable speaker from C1 for refusing to lower the volume after being asked by S1 to lower it several times. C1 attempted to retrieve the speaker from S1; however, S1 refused to return the speaker to C1. C1 \u201cflicked,\u201d S1\u2019s hat and pushed him. S1 pushed C1 back and a physical altercation ensued between them. Staff #2 (S2) intervened and separated both parties. C1 was led to Program Support (PSS). After sitting at PSS for several minutes, C1 ran back to the Cottage and pushed S1 again. S1 pushed C1 back and another physical altercation ensued between parties. S2 ran back to the Cottage and separated both parties. Both altercations were captured on surveillance footage. (Continued on page LIC809-C)\n\nC1 was checked by the facility nurse and later taken to the hospital for further assessment. Medical records revealed C1 was hit with fists several times and placed in a chokehold, sustaining mild swelling and a brief loss of consciousness. After the altercation S1 left the facility and never returned. On August 9, 2020, S1 called the facility to officially resign from his position. Upon occurrence, the facility contacted all required parties and conducted an internal investigation pertaining to the incident. Corrections concerning facility policy and procedures pertaining to this incident were reviewed and updated as necessary. Based on gathered information there is corroborating evidence to support claims of abuse. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has therefore determined substantiated findings for physical abuse by S1 on C1 as evidence revealed S1 failed to de-escalate the situation or call for assistance in controlling C1's behavior. S1\u2019s actions on C1 poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. The facility is issued a citation in accordance with the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1; 87072 (d)(11) Personal Rights.

    "narrative": "Information revealed C2 was the victim of sexual assault from C1. C2 was reportedly scared of C1 and C1 forced C2 to engage in sexual acts. According to statements from an eyewitness having firsthand accounts of the incident occurring on December 10, 2020, it was observed C2 was not performing sexual acts, but was receiving sexual acts from C1. While statements provided contradicting information, the incident may have been a consensual encounter. The incident occurred during the overnight shift. The incident was reported to staff who contacted C2 privately and C2 confirmed that he performed oral sex on C1. C1 was moved to a single room after the incident. All appropriate reporting and contacts were completed concerning the incident. According to statements, C2 complied with C1 due to being threatened by C1 and feeling scared. Statements obtained revealed contradicting information concerning a pre-established rule that requires residents who share a room with their roommates to keep their doors open when both residents are occupying the room. In addition, statements revealed that not all staffs properly conduct 15-minute room checks of the residents as facility policy require staff to conduct. Based on information gathered, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined facility neglected to adequately monitor residents resulting in inappropriate sexual contact by C1 and C2; thus, posing potential risk to the children placed in care. Therefore, facility is cited under the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. See page 9099D for deficiency.

LPA Dahl Larios observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident.

The investigation revealed that a facility client was found unresponsive in his bedroom by a facility staff on May 18, 2020. The facility client died from a drug overdose. Statements obtained from the confidential interviews indicated that the facility client\u2019s death could have been prevented as medical attention could have been administered if staff found him in distress when he vomited during his sleep which was a side effect of the drug overdose. Staff #1 and Staff #2 were assigned to the cottage where the facility client resided. Both staff admitted during the investigation that they did not check on the facility clients during their shift. The video footage obtained of the cottage showed Staff #1 asleep during parts of her shift. Staff #2 was seen on the video to have left the cottage from 0349 hours and returned at 0506 hours. The facility staff failed to conduct their duties per facility policy in checking on the clients every 10 minutes during their shift.

    "narrative": "On 09/18/20, the department received a complaint alleging that a client was constantly running away (AWOL) from the facility. Staff workers that were interviewed provided a statement and denied the allegation of neglect/lack of supervision. It was disclosed that the client has a history of running away and staff acted appropriate in attempting to verbally redirect the client not to run away. Staff interviews did not reveal having any knowledge that the client would return with large amounts of money as a result of any illicit activities when the client was AWOL. Staff workers stated that all clients are always being monitored and staff workers are working within staff to client ratio. The county social worker (CSW) for one of the clients (CSW) expressed no concerns with the care and supervision by the facility. In confidential interviews the client that was identified in the report of running away denied the allegation of having a large amount of money connected to any illicit activities. The client confirmed that he sustained an upper leg injury after climbing over the fence as he was returning back to the facility after being awol. The client stated that staff are present at the facility when he runs away. Two other clients admit to saying comments in the form of \"gossiping\" about the client doing illicit activities when going AWOL and returning to the facility with large amounts of money. Statements by other stated that the allegation was reported only as an abundance of caution, based on hearing two clients \"gossiping\". Based on interviews and records reviewed there was no corroborating information to substantiate the allegation. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the above allegation did or did not happen. Therefore, this complaint is being closed Unsubstantiated. No deficiencies were cited at this time during this inspection and LPA informed the facility representative that LPA would e-mail a copy of this report for review and signature.",

LPA Rarela discussed the following with the facility representative named above. On May 21, 2020, the Department received a complaint requesting the investigation of a facility client\u2019s death and alleging inadequate staff supervision regarding the incident. The investigation was substantiated and revealed that a facility client was found unresponsive in his bedroom by a facility staff on May 18, 2020. The facility client died from a drug overdose. Statements obtained from the confidential interviews indicated that the facility client\u2019s death could have been prevented as medical attention could have been administered if staff found him in distress when he vomited during his sleep, which was a side effect of the drug overdose. Staff #1 and Staff #2 were assigned to the cottage where the facility client died. Staff #1 and Staff #2 were aware that the client had a history of drug abuse and was absent from the facility for 24 hours prior to returning to the facility. Both staff admitted during the investigation that they did not check on the facility clients during their shift. The video footage obtained of the cottage showed Staff #1 asleep during parts of her shift. Staff #2 was seen on the video to have left the cottage from 0349 hours and returned at 0506 hours. The facility staff failed to conduct their duties per facility policy in checking on the clients every 10 minutes during their shift. Staff #1 and Staff #2 falsified the bedroom check logs and indicated they conducted room checks throughout their shift when they admitted that they did not check on the clients. Both staff were terminated by the facility effective June 5, 2020. The facility was cited on September 30, 2020 for 80078(a) Responsibility for providing care and supervision. (Continued)\n\nThe Department has concluded an analysis and determined that an Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted. Under Health and Safety Code section 1548(e)(3)(B), a violation that the Department determines resulted in the death of a person receiving care from a short-term residential therapeutic program with a licensed capacity between 41-100 children will result in a civil penalty of $10,000.00. A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form, Appeal Rights and form LIC 421-D(CRP) for a Civil Penalty Assessment \u2013 Death / Serious Bodily Injury / Physical Abuse were provided to the facility representative via electronic mail.",

Davis went to Haynes Family of Programs on December 08, 2021 at 9:15am in order to follow up on a Special Incident Report (SIR) that was submitted to Community Care Licensing on November 10, 2021. LPA met with William Sanchez, Campus Manager (CM), and discussed the incident. The SIR stated that child #1 (see Confidential Names form (LIC 811) dated December 08, 2021) took a lighter from his pocket and proceeded to light the facility's security camera. During the course of the follow up, LPA obtained information that staff was providing care and supervision at the facility. During a routine accountability check, staff observed the security camera on fire that was located in the corner of the upstairs hallway. Staff investigated the matter and it was determined that child #1 had used a lighter to set the facility's security camera on fire. Staff was unsuccessful in their efforts to get child #1 to empty his pockets. Based on information and facts obtained in this matter, the Department has found that the child was in a gang and struggled with his program while in placement at the facility. The child was able to sneak the lighter into the facility unbeknownst to the staff. Information shows that the child is no longer placed at the facility. Therefore, the situation has been stabilized and no citations will be issued on this date. No further follow up is necessary. Exit interview done",

    "narrative": "On 05/11/2022, the Department received a complaint alleging allegation for personal Rights violation. It was alleged that a staff worker engaged inappropriately with a client of being in a relationship. Staff workers assigned to the cottage where the client was identified as being the alleged victim denied the allegation. All staff workers stated that there is no inappropriate activities occurring among staff and clients. In confidential interviews, all clients that were interviewed denied the allegation and stated that all staff workers are respectable and they have never committed any sexual advances towards them. One client admitted to saying things that were not true while at school about being in a relationship with a female staff. The one client stated that \u201cit\u2019s just talk\u201d and stated he never had any form of sexual contact with that one staff. Individual identified as other is deemed to be a credible witness who stated that the allegation that was overheard by the one client is accurate when first reported. The County Probation Office representative met with the one client and determined that there were no concerns and no further action was required but will follow up with Licensing Program Analyst Vargas's investigation. Interviews by the clients provided consistent statements and denied the allegation. However, one client admitted to saying that he was having a relationship with a female staff but he was \u201cjust talking\u201d to others while attending school off-site. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the agency representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection. An exit interview was conducted and the Appeal rights given were and explained. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

When C1 exited his room he advised staff he had ingested \"6 pink pills.\" C1 was then transported by EMS to the hospital for evaluation. LPA's asked PS if she knew how or when C1 obtained the pills. PS stated she was not sure if C1 had \"cheeked\" the pills or if had obtained them during another medication incident. PS stated there was another incident on 10/11/22 where she was in the office destroying some of C1's pills, and he barged into the office and grabbed a medication pack. PS stated staff was able to get the medication back from C1; however, some of the medications fell and staff retrieved them. PS stated that a medication count was conducted and showed all pills were accounted for. LPA's asked if C1 had any history with medication refusal or \"cheeking\" his medications and PS stated he did not. LPA's asked what the typical procedure is when clients take medications she stated clients take the medication place it on their tongue, drink water, then open their mouth and show staff heir tongue and underneath their tongue. PS stated since the incident staff are making sure to do an extra check with C1 to ensure that he is not \"cheeking\" his medications.\n\nPS stated that Mental Health Services for C1 have also been increased and staff are attempting to provide more one on one services and \"check ins\" with him. PS stated, currently C1 is on independent studies in an attempt to try and get him more stabilized. LPAs spoke with C1 regarding the incident. C1 stated to LPAs that he was feeling upset and suicidal because he is unhappy at school and does not like being around kids. LPAs asked C1 where he got the pills from. C1 said that he was \"cheeking\" his pills to keep them. LPAs asked C1 if staff would check his mouth after giving him his medications. C1 said that yes they would but he still could hide the pills from staff. LPAs asked C1 if he feels supported from staff and mental health services. C1 said yes he does feel staff is supportive and his mental health services are helping him. C1 said that he does not feel supportive from his school and does not want to be around other kids. Additionally, LPA's discussed reporting requirements with PS and esnuring that IR's are as detailed as possible. No deficiency will be issued at this time.

During the facility's internal investigation, they put the staff on leave until a conclusion was made. The facility also submitted a Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR) as mandated.

IB found that, \"[Client 1] was in a physical fight with a resident, [Client 2] and during this fight [Client 1] was restrained by [Staff 1] and [Staff 2] for his safety. After [Client 1] was released from the restraint, [Client 1's] left wrist was injured so he was immediately transported to the [Hospital]. [Client 1] was diagnosed with a fractured left wrist. During the interview [Client 1] said the restraint did not cause his injury. It is unknown if [Client 1] injured his wrist in the fight or when he hit himself with (a) scooter or the application of the restraint. Staff [1] and [Staff 2] stated they didn't think they caused the injury during the application of the restraint. Other staff stated they didn't believe [Staff 1] injured [Client 1] on purpose, and [Client 1's] injury was an accident.\" Additionally, the re-breaking of Client 1's arm/wrist during a subsequent restraint was investigated and has an inconclusive finding as well due to not knowing what specifically caused that re-break as Client 1 also had been hitting his previously injured hand/wrist on windows aggressively immediately before the restraint.

Linda Abdelbaki, Program Planner with CPS, was also present during the meeting. Issues discussed today: 1. Lack of supervision. 2. Administrative oversight. 3. Incident Reporting. 4. Emergency Interventions. 5. False reporting. 6. Personal rights. Discussion: 1: Lack of Supervision - Director explained that they had meetings with staff to explain how getting coverage works, and that they wrote up a system for how staff can get support. Explained who all is on campus who can be contacted for extra support. Explained how they handle staff in crisis situation. Subsequent trainings conducted. How they hold staff accountable. They do not use administrative staff as part of the ratio, however Administration assists in situations. 2: Administrator Oversight: It was discussed that the Administrator needs to be present at the facility for a minimum of 20 hours per week. Director and CEO informed CCL staff present that there are actually multiple Administrator-qualified members of the staff who are present in the facility to meet this requirement. It is understood that the Administrator(s) shall provide oversight of the staff.\n\n3. Incident Reporting: There was an incident regarding bed bugs at the facility for which an incident report was sent to CCL on 5/24/2021, and the facility did not update/report new developments. Director explained all steps they have taken to get rid of the bed bugs since then. The facility did not notify CCL about them moving the clients to the gym while the facility was being treated. It was explained to Director/CEO/President that they must notify CCL about moving clients. LPM asked Director how they are training their staff to write incident reports. Director explained. LPM asked Director about what they ask staff to remove from incident reports, and Director explained. 4. Emergency Interventions: The facility uses the ProAct emergency intervention program which includes non-physical and physical interventions. The facility trains staff in trauma-informed care. 5. False Reporting: CCL and Administration discussed the substantiated finding of false claims from the complaint delivered on 12/18/2020. This complaint was re-opened on 5/6/2021 to obtain more information. CCL explained to Administration that concluding the further investigation, the finding that staff falsified a document, stands. Administration will take further action with the staff who falsified a document, and send the plan and documentation to CCL. 6. Personal Rights: RM discussed the case management finding delivered on 12/18/2020 regarding a staff member violating two clients personal rights by picking them up and pushing them. RM informed Administrative staff that CCL is taking an Administrative Action against that staff to be excluded. LPA Chad Cabigon and Director will develop a plan to check in with each other weekly.

    "narrative": "The client needed a refill, however the medication prescribed required a prior authorization from Medi-Cal. The facility worked with the pharmacy to get the prior authorization ahead of time, however, it did not come in time. The facility proactively requested an emergency supply of the medication. The emergency supply ran out, one dose, before the prior authorization was approved and the full prescription could be filled. The misunderstanding in the MAR occurred because staff were giving the emergency supply to the client, however it was miscommunicated and not documented properly, so other staff thought the client missed the medication. LPA found that the pharmacy and Medi-Cal issues caused the missed dose of medication, and not the facility. Since then, the facility did conduct a refresher training with staff to prevent any future confusion. LPA also found that two staff did mismanage two different clients' medications. 1. On 4/25/2021, one staff gave a client another client's medication. The client was monitored and had no issues. The staff was written up and provided a refresher training. 2. On 5/14/2021, another staff gave a different client another client's medication. The client was monitored and had no issues. The staff was written up and provided a refresher training. LPA obtained those write-ups and proof of training. Due to staff mismanaging clients' medications, LPA finds the allegation that staff are mismanaging minors medication to be substantiated, or true.

At the time, the food was removed from the pantry and put in the kitchen. Staff sprayed the gnats nightly, and wiped them up the following day. The pest control company did come out to spray again. During interviews, LPA learned that the cycling of gnats lasted for about four weeks. On 2/16/2021 when LPA visited the facility and observed the dead gnats in the pantry, it was about the time that the gnat issue was resolving. After that inspection, the facility had maintenance staff clean out the overhead light where the dead gnats were, and other staff cleaned up the rest. Soon after, the facility put a mat over the closed crawlspace to try to further prevent anymore gnats from coming through. This completely resolved the issue. In subsequent visits (in person, and virtually) to the facility, LPA did not observe any more gnats in the pantry. Based on all the interviews and evidence, LPA found that the facility did have insects, so the finding for this allegation is substantiated, or true, however LPA also found the facility did take the correct actions necessary to rid the facility of the pests.

The licensee must use a continuum of interventions, starting with the least restrictive intervention. The Department has determined that there was sufficient evidence of an unwarranted restraint based on the text message sent by the direct care staff. LPA found through interviews that the facility fails to provide adequate supervision of clients. Staff stated there are not enough staff to provide necessary 1:1 supervision of the clients when needed. Staff reported that when multiple escalations are happening simultaneously, there are not enough staff present to assist staff and supervise the remaining clients. Staff also reported that sometimes staff are not able to shadow clients who AWOL due to staff being stretched thinly in a crisis. It was disclosed by staff that four clients were left alone due to staff having to follow a high-risk client who AWOL'd and on another occasion staff left two clients alone with an intern, who is not counted in ratio and is not considered staff. Another staff stated that they had to leave three clients alone in a cottage before due to having to handle another situation, while radioed help needed to come assist. A client also confirmed that; frequently, up to two to three times a day, staff will have to radio for assistance when handling an emergent situation and the clients would be alone for five to ten minutes until someone else can come to assist. LPA observed a common scenario of staff being stretched thinly to where they cannot handle the supervision needs of clients when multiple clients are in crisis, or restraints, or AWOL. Although the facility meets the general minimum ratio required in the Interim Licensing Standards, they are not providing adequate staffing ratios for the clients' needs and behaviors. Based on interviews, LPA has found the allegation that the facility does not provide adequate supervision of clients to be substantiated, or true.\n\nThe facility is being cited for violations of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Version 3.1 Section 87095 (b) Emergency Interventions. The facility was also cited for Section 87065.5(g). An office meeting was held on 6/14/2021 with the Department's Regional Manager, Licensing Program Manager, Licensing Program Analyst and facility representatives to further discuss these serious violations.

Corroborating statements from facility staff also indicate that medical treatment was offered, and while youth allowed some first aid to be administered at the Cowell Center, youth initially refused being taken to acute care. As for whether proper interventions were utilized by staff, statements obtained from youth and staff were inconsistent about staff\u2019s actions in responding to the incident in real time. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur; therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "Per reports, on 04/02/2024 during a crisis, a youth (C1) got a hold of broken glass from a window that they broke. While in possession of the glass, the youth swung at other youth and facility staff and threatened to harm people with it. Law enforcement officers eventually detained the youth who was transported to a hospital for a 5150 evaluation. As a result of this incident, the facility discharged the youth from the program\u2014when the hospital determined that the youth was no longer a danger to others or the youth\u2019s self and was therefore ready to be discharged from acute care, the facility did not accept the youth back citing safety concerns, and deferred to the youth\u2019s parent for placement elsewhere. In the facility\u2019s Discharge Policy, a copy of which was acknowledged and signed by both the youth and the youth\u2019s adoptive parent, the facility has a provision that allows an unplanned discharge\u2014a more immediate discharge without the usual 14-day notice\u2014if it is determined that a client is \u201ca clear danger to self or others.\u201d In submitted Incident Reports and CFT meeting notes, C1\u2019s difficulty in controlling their anger, impulsiveness, as well as a history of physical aggression towards peers and staff were documented along with the facility\u2019s efforts in trying to address these behaviors. Documentation also shows that there were times during placement when the youth was doing well as evidenced by a decrease in disruptive and problematic behaviors. A more recent interview with the youth and with staff at the youth\u2019s current placement indicated that the youth has not displayed any dangerous behaviors and was generally doing well. Although the allegation may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur; therefore the allegations is Unsubstantiated.

Regarding a youth being hit by another peer, three of the seven clients interviewed corroborated this but described it only within the context of peer-to-peer fighting involving the client in question, with one of the other clients characterizing the said youth as the actual aggressor.

The violence altercation according to the NMD, was that her boyfriend pulled her nose ring that led to a bleeding of her nose. Per Administrator, there was no tearing, or bruise or marks on her nose and face and she did not want to see a medical doctor. Administrator stated that County placement worker has been notified about NMD\u2019s police report and CSW has been in contact with NMD and met her outside of the facility for more support. Per Administrator, NMD refused to file a restraining order to her boyfriend, but nonetheless an Officer gave NMD instructions on how to file a request of restraining order. The plan of action, per Administrator that they have put in place is that they have asked NMD to block the name and telephone number of her boyfriend on her phone, which NMD stated that she did. The CSW was notified and in constant contact with the NMD, she communicates to staff when she signs herself off to the community, NMD let the staff know if she is staying overnight. STRTP staff double checks when NMD leaves, get the license plate number of the vehicle, reminds NMD to answer or reply staffs phone calls or text messages. Per Therapist, she conducts a safety check with NMD twice a week and continues to offer assistance with filing a restraining order should NMD change her mind.

It was alleged that client was physically assaulted and sexually trafficked while on AWOL from the facility. Based on the information gathered during confidential interviews, relevant parties denied the allegation indicating client ran away from the facility six times during client\u2019s stay at the facility from 5/24/23 through 6/13/23. Confidential interviews indicated when clients AWOL from the facility staff will be attempted to redirect clients, offer alternatives, and follow clients as the clients are AWOLing. Staff will then report AWOL, and call law enforcement. Once a client returns staff will offer medical attention and a safety check is conducted. Confidential interviews revealed clients have no concerns with the facility and stated staff will attempt to redirect clients and offer alternatives. LPA was not able to obtain a statement from the alleged victim due to the victim being on run away status. CSW indicated having no concerns with the facility and stated the incident happened when client was on AWOL and no longer placed at the facility. CSW indicated the client has been on AWOL status for a year. The other agency\u2019s delivered service logs and investigative report did not mention client being AWOL\u2019d from the facility, however, there continues to be safety risks for client. LPA reviewed incident reports which indicated client AWOL\u2019d from the facility six times. Each time client AWOL\u2019d, staff wrote incident reports and intervention was attempted. LPA reviewed the STRTP\u2019s run away plan and client\u2019s safety plan which indicated the steps the facility took to try and discourage client from AWOLing.

Staff and children both denied the allegation. Staff stated that they do not use inappropriate forms of punishment. Staff stated when children get into trouble, they have privileges removed but that they are afforded opportunities to gain those privileges back. Staff stated children are not restricted from receiving essential items or necessities as forms of punishments. Children stated they have never seen or experienced staff restricting them or doing inappropriate forms of disciplines. Furthermore, it was alleged staff do not accord privacy to minors in care. Staff stated that it is policy to knock on doors prior to entering children\u2019s rooms and if children do not answer they will announce entry into the room. Children stated that they are not aware or ever had any staff not afford them privacy in the home. It was alleged facility is in disrepair. Staff and children had similar statements in stating that home is well maintained and that if any issues or maintenance is needed that facility addresses issues immediately. On 10/20/2022 LPA and Administrator toured the facility both inside and out. LPA observed the facility to be in good repair and areas that needed repair already had a date of maintenance scheduled to complete and repair issues. It was alleged staff do not ensure that minor's in care get to school in a timely manner. Staff stated that children sometimes are delayed in getting up in the morning and refuse to go to school. Administrator stated that it has been an issue with tardiness with children and school administration and school resource officer have been to home numerous times to witness children refusing to go to school.\n\nChildren denied the allegation and stated that staff do try and get children to school on time but that sometimes children in the home cause a delay in getting to school on time. Lastly, it was alleged staff are interfering with minors' ability to purchase clothing while in care. Staff stated that children are given a monthly clothing allowance and that children usually use most of the allowance. However, if children have left over money, they receive the excess money to save or to use. Staff stated that children sign that they receive their allowances and it is documented in the amount that was used or provided back to child. Children had similar statements that they do receive allowances and that they are afforded opportunities to go to purchase clothing monthly. Documents reviewed identified staff do complete weekly grocery shopping and put in for maintenance repairs for facility. Based on information received and documents reviewed there was no indication that facility was or is in disrepair, children are receiving inappropriate disciplines, staff are not affording privacy to children, or that staff are the reason children are not getting to school in a timely manner.

On June 15, 2021, Community Care Licensing received a complaint allegation regarding alleged personal rights violation by an unidentified staff member on, Client #1 (C1) [see LIC811 dated 9/14/2021]. It is alleged that on an unspecified date, approximately two weeks prior to receipt of the complaint referral, an unidentified male staff member went into the facility bathroom while C1 was inside, then touched minor inappropriately. Based on information obtained from interviews during the investigation, there is not enough evidence at this time to support reports of sexual abuse.

    "narrative": "During the investigation, interviews were conducted with, but not limited to, C1, S1, residents, and staff members. A review of facility records including past incident reports and client file history revealed insufficient evidence to support alleged claims. Review of an incident report involving S1 and C1 dated 12/17/2017, revealed in part that C1 was \u201cbullying another client\u201d while S1 was attempting to de-escalate the situation. C1 became upset and attempted to attack S1 as S1 attempted to restrain C1. At some point a physical altercation ensued between C1 and S1 resulting in both parties wrestling on the floor. Other staff were present and assisted S1 with restraining C1. S1 states that any physical contact made with C1 was non-sexual and only with the intent of restraining C1. There was no corroborating evidence to support claim. The investigation revealed that while physical contact was made during an apparent restraint between C1 and S1 on 12/17/2017, to which other staff were present and assisted, there is not enough evidence to support the allegation that S1 touched C1 inappropriately in private areas during the restraint and/or while in care. The finding has therefore been determined as Unsubstantiated meaning, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove or disprove a violation occurred. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. Exit interview conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights are emailed to Facility Administrator.\n\nC1\u2019s room and on another instance where C1 was showering. S1 reports that the instances were inadvertent, and no knocks were made prior to entering C1\u2019s door. S1 reports being in a rush at the time and accidentally walked in on C1 during both incidents. S1 denies any sexual gratification derived from these incidents and states they were accidents. S1 states that S1 left immediately after both incidents. Based on the confidential interviews conducted and documentary evidence obtained during the investigation the preponderance of evidence standard has been met that a violation occurred, therefore the above allegation is determined Substantiated. Facility is cited per the Interim Licensing Standards for STRTP V 3.1; Section 87065.2 PERSONNEL DUTIES. S1 accidentally walked in C1's room on two separate occasions while C1 was undressing and while C1 was showering. Actions as such pose potential health and safety risks to children in care. Exit.

It was also detailed in the allegation that once C2 disclosed this information to GH staff, C2 changed rooms. Confidential witness statements corroborate that C1 did these actions to C2, however, confidential interviews also corroborate that C2 dared C1 to do some of these actions to C2.

While C1\u2019s needs and service plan does mention C1\u2019s sexual history, there is nothing in the needs and service plan requiring for C1 to be under constant supervision.

The purpose of the inspection was to complete the continuation inspection for STRTP annual inspection that was initiated on June 30, 2021. LPA already completed the physical inspection of the facility and reviewed facility client files on the first day of the annual inspection. During this annual inspection continuation, LPA Escobar reviewed ten personnel files to ensure they contained all required documentation per Title 22 Regulations and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS). Personnel Files are usually maintained in a locked closet inside the staff office. All appropriate personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. Nine of the ten files that were reviewed were for employees who converted from group home personnel to STRTP personnel. LPA observed the converted staff members were trained according to the STRTP training requirements. Files for staff 1 (S1), staff 2 (S2), staff 4 (S4), staff 5 (S5), staff 6 (S6), staff 7 (S7), staff 8 (S8), staff 9 (S9), and staff 10 (S10) did not have employer verification form in files.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that on or around 06/30/21, S1 engaged in a physical altercation with C1. Specifically, it was reported that C1 took a pen and S1 charged at C1 and tackled C1. Details state C1 sustained a \u201cfat lip\u201d during the attack and then C1 was placed on a 5150 hold. S1 denies charging and attacking C1 and denies injuring C1 and giving C1 a \u201cfat lip\u201d. S1 states C1 was threatening to hurt and kill S1 and also threatening to self-harm which is why S1 took away the pencil from C1. S1 states S1 raised S1\u2019s arms to block the attack from C1, however, denies hitting, assaulting, or attacking C1 in any form. Additionally, S1 states she did not give C1 a \u201cfat lip\u201d either. Another witness maintains staff put hands on C1, however, witness was unsure of how S1 physically attacked or grabbed C1 as could not provide any details. All witnesses corroborate that there was a verbal altercation between C1 and S1, however, S1 states she had to raise her voice to try to de-escalate C1 as C1 was extremely escalated and yelling loudly. There were no witnesses that observed any physical interaction between S1 and C1. One witness states they heard C1 yell things such as, \u201cGet off me! Get your hands off me!\u201d but did not see what was happening as the room door was closed and the incident occurred in the hallway area of the house. The majority of witnesses state S1 has never put hands on any clients in the STRTP. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegation that S1 engaged in a physical altercation with C1, may have occurred, however, it is not supported or proven by evidence. The allegation is, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were provided to Ms. Leticia Castaneda for original signature. Signed report will be placed in facility file.",

    "narrative": "During the investigation, confidential interviews reported that C1 left the facility on a continuous basis despite staff efforts to keep C1 from leaving the facility while in care. Confidential interviews further reported that C1\u2019s placement was terminated due to safety concerns for staff and other clients in care. Confidential interviews maintained that staff followed the programs protocols when C1 left the facility or attempted to leave the facility. Another confidential interview reported that C1 was placed at the facility with an agreement that C1 was going to have one on one care due to C1\u2019s history however, that care was not provided to C1 at the facility due to staff shortage. Another confidential interview stated that C1 left the facility when C1 felt like leaving the facility and there were times when staff attempted to redirect C1 and other times where staff did not do anything about C1 leaving the facility. Another confidential interview stated not witnessing Absent Without Leave (AWOLs) at the facility and further stated feeling safe at current placement and reported no concerns about staff supervision. Based on the confidential interviews, and record review the allegation that staff did not prevent C1 from wandering from the facility, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Home of Excellence, House Manager, Leticia Castaneda.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews were inconsistent regarding who was involved and witnessed the incident, except S6. Confidential interviews reported that, based on C1\u2019s past behaviors, staff reasonably suspected that C1 was hiding contraband in their pants pocket. Multiple confidential interviews reported that staff repeatedly asked C1 to let go of the pants and staff tried to de-escalate the situation; C1 would not loosen their grip on the pants and refused to comply with staff. Confidential interviews reported staff (S6) was not aggressive toward C1 but did reach for the pants, resulting in C1 pulling the pants, which caused C1 and S6 to fall to the floor. A confidential witness interview reported that S6 restrained C1 while C1 was on the ground. Other confidential interviews reported that C1 and S6 did not fall to the ground, and S6 did not restrain C1. In addition, confidential interviews reported that S6 did not hit C1, and C1 did not sustain any injuries or require medical attention. Pertinent documentation also reported that C1 had no observable marks or bruising. Other confidential interviews reported that S6 choked C1 and disclosed that C1 reported being physically abused by staff at the STRTP. The LPA did not receive any corroborating information during confidential interviews as the interviews denied staff hit or mistreated clients in care. The Department also received an allegation that staff spoke inappropriately to the minor (C1) in care. It was alleged that staff called C1 names. Confidential interviews reported staff did not yell or speak negatively about C1 or other clients in care. Other confidential interviews reported staff (S1) called names and made derogatory remarks about client behaviors. It was further reported that there were no concerns regarding client and staff interactions; confidential interviews reported staff were respectful and acted professionally. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegations that staff (S6) hit a minor (C1) in care and staff spoke inappropriately to the minor (C1) in care are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "A confidential witness reported C1 was physically assaulted by S6 by putting their hands on C1\u2019s throat and hit C1\u2019s left hand, however the date the incident took place was not known. Additional confidential witnesses reported the alleged incident happened in January 2023. LPA requested but did not receive a copy of the incident report to confirm the validity of the statements provided. A confidential witness reported the incident was a result of C1 not letting go of a pair of pants. It was reported C1 would not loosen their grip on the pants, fell back onto the couch, and then fell to the floor. S6 denied all allegations of physical abuse. Community Care Licensing also received an allegation that staff spoke inappropriately to minor in care. It was alleged that staff called C1 names. A confidential witness reported that staff did not call any of the clients names or speak inappropriately to clients in care. It was further reported, that C1 would get upset when clients made blunt remarks about C1. A Confidential witness also reported that C1 was yelled at by staff, no longer employed at the facility,and S2. However, they did not reveal what was said to C1. It was further stated that staff will use a firm tone when redirecting clients, but they do not yell at the clients. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and lack of documentation, the allegations staff hit minor and staff spoke inappropriately to minor in care in care, may have occurred. However, the allegations are not supported or proven by the evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights were provided to Home of Excellence, Facility Manager, Leticia Castaneda.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews reported when law enforcement (LE) arrived at the STRTP, C1 admitted to LE they (C1) used a \u201crazor\u201d to cut their (C1\u2019s) face. Confidential interviews also reported that C1 did not disclose where they (C1) obtained the object used to self-harm, and the safety search conducted by staff did not recover the object. In addition, information obtained from other confidential interviews reported that clients do not have access to sharp objects. However, clients are allowed to use shaving razors, but C1 and other clients are monitored due to unsafe behaviors. Additionally, multiple confidential interviews reported that due to C1's behavior's staff do not ignore C1\u2019s self-harming; staff provide emergency interventions and utilize C1\u2019s safety plan. The Department also received an allegation that staff (S1) teased a minor (C1) in care. It was reported during the same incident, mentioned above, that S1 made offensive remarks about C1 \u2018s appearance. More specifically, it was alleged that S1 criticized C1\u2019s makeup. A confidential interview reported that C1 was wearing dark makeup. However, other confidential interviews reported that S1 only mentioned C1\u2019s makeup because it resembled \u201cblack face.\u201d A Confidential witness interview reported hearing S1 comment on C1\u2019s makeup, but the witness did not know what was said. In addition, confidential interviews reported that C1 is \u201ccreative\" and staff complement C1\u2019s appearance. Furthermore, confidential interviews denied S1 or other staff, teasing clients in care and reported staff to allow clients to express themselves freely. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and documentation, the allegations that staff (S1) did not prevent a minor (C1) from self-harming and that staff (S1) teased a minor (C1) in care are unsubstantiated.
