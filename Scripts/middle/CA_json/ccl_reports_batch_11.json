The purpose of this meeting was to discuss possible extension of Our Safe Haven's Provisional License (expiring 10/30/2021) pending the home's Mental Health Plan Approval by the home's host county. LPA met with Licensee/Administrator Crystal Campbell, who helped facilitate this meeting. Also in attendance were Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong, and Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) representative Patricia Coyle. Currently in care are 4 ambulatory clients. During this meeting, attendees discussed barriers to the final facility survey and approval of Our Safe Haven's Mental Health Plan by Alameda County, which the county has stated is due to the unprecedented high volume of regularly scheduled and pandemic-deferred surveys that have taken precedence. Licensee Campbell has been in continual contact with the county, submitting required documentation and coordinating scheduling the final site certification visit. According to Licensee Campbell, the county has communicated that submitted documentation is under review, and the licensee should be contacted before the end of next week regarding scheduling the final walkthrough. Attendees also discussed ways to speed along this process, and discussed extending Our Safe Haven's Provisional License for an additional 6 months to allow for the approval process to be completed. Attendees requested the Licensee Campbell submit documentation of correspondence with Alameda County Mental Health to support the decision to extend the provisional license date. The facility shall submit a written request for extension of their provisional license, to include steps already taken for approval, and barriers to approval of their mental health plan.

LPA met with Facility Manager Jessica Reyes and informed of the purpose of the visit. Safety precautions were taken, including screening call, mask-wearing, and hand-hygiene. During investigation, LPA learned that there was an incident in which resident R1 (See LIC 811, dated 3/14/22) became upset by something that staff S1 stated after possibly misunderstanding what S1 said. The incident escalated, and R1 threw apples at S1. During the incident, S2 was holding R1 back to avoid an escalated altercation, and S1 was heard by S2 and S3 over the phone stating S1 did not care about the job and asking S2 to let go of R1 to see if R1 would fight. Prior to this incident, there had been another incident between S1 and R1, and a supervision plan was put in place, which involved two staff being present so as to allow S1 to avoid all communication with R1 to not aggravate R1. However, during the incident, the second staff S2 was in the administrative office and the facility manager had left for a short while (approximately 20 minutes), which was long enough for an incident to occur. S2 intervened and notified Facility Manager by phone, who made their way back to the facility. LPA is issuing a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87065 Personnel Requirements. See attached LIC 809-D.

During the review of facility records, LPA observed that emergency disaster plan, license, personal rights, facility sketch, menu, and complaint procedures were posted in the facility. LPA observed that the disaster drills documentation was not maintained on site, and LPA advised, per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Section 80023, that disaster drills be documented and that documentation be maintained on site. During the review of resident records, LPA observed that resident R1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 12/17/21) had a medical screening but did not have a TB test. LPA advised, per CCR, Title 22, Section 80069, that the LIC 602 Physician's Report be completed by a physician for R1. During the review of staff records, LPA observed that staff records and staff training records were located at the administrative office and needed to be brought to the facility during the visit. LPA advises, per CCR, Title 22, Sections 80066 and 87095.65, that originals or copies of personnel records be maintained at the facility site at all times. LPA observed that staff S2 and S3 had TB tests but no LIC 503 Health Screening. LPA advised, per CCR, Title 22, Section 80066, that the LIC 503 be completed by a physician for both staff.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Michelle P. Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Mattie Mash, Facility Administrator.",

LPA met with Administrator Mattie Marsh and informed of the purpose of the visit. Safety precautions were taken, including mask-wearing and pre-visit screening call. During an investigation at the facility, it was discovered that the facility is refusing to transport resident R1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) to an extracurricular activity in the region. There is a posting in the staff office that reads, \"No one is to give [R1] a ride to color guard. We do not provide transportation for extra curricular activities.\" Additionally, R1's needs and services lists traveling to color guard as a goal for R1 and discusses that R1 has taken the bus, but it does not have anywhere in writing that there is an agreement that R1 is to take the bus. Further, neither R1 nor R1's county social worker signed the needs and services plan; only the clinical social worker and the administrator have signed. LPA is issuing a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87074 Transportation and an advisory of Section 87068.2 Needs and Services Plan. It was also discovered that the facility issued a consequence to resident R1 due to R1 not completing chores and being disrespectful to staff. The consequence was issued on Saturday 5/21/22, and notice of the consequence was given to youth the same day. The consequence was that R1 could not attend the outing, bowling. During today's inspection, LPA observed that the consequence was not documented in the consequence log binder or elsewhere, and Administrator admitted it was not documented. Administrator also stated that the consequence was issued without collaboration with the youth. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87072.1 Discipline Policies and Procedures. Lastly, during today's visit, it was discovered that the facility was short-staffed this morning with a ratio after 7AM of 1 staff to 4 residents. Per Administrator, the staff who was scheduled to work this morning called off last night due to a family emergency, but no additional staff was called until this morning at 7:38AM.\n\nAdministrator stated that they believed they could manage supervision of all residents on their own. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87065.5 Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios. Three citations and one advisory was issued at today's visit.

LPA met with Administrator Mattie Marsh and Facility Manager Brice Marsh and informed of the purpose of the visit. Based on the incident report and confidential interviews with staff and residents, a staff member did not follow facility procedures for medication administration by allowing a resident to have direct access to their box of medications and also by not maintaining constant, direct supervision of the resident, resulting in the resident being able to pull out a bottle of psychotropic medication. The resident was later able to self-administer the medication and took enough to induce vomiting and potentially overdose. The youth was admitted to the program on 8/16/22, and this incident occurred on 8/21/22 evening around 7:30PM-8PM, and on 8/22/22 morning around 8AM, staff noticed the medication was missing. On 8/22/22, after being unable to locate the medication, staff spoke to involved resident, who admitted to taking the medication and to taking the high amount of pills missing from the bottle, which was about 26 pills. The facility immediately took the resident to the hospital. The youth was held overnight and released the following day. Based on confidential interviews, the facility has increased supervision, checks in more with the resident to provide additional supports, and has made a plan to terminate the staff member. LPA obtained staff file for further review. No deficiencies have been found at today's visit.

    "narrative": "On 1/25/23, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a case management visit to follow-up on the noncompliance conference (NCC) held on 10/13/2022, terms from which are listed below. LPA met with Administrators Patrick Davis and Mattie Marsh and informed of the purpose of the visit. (1) The facility will be subject to frequent visits following this NCC, at which supervision, emergency intervention procedures, trauma-informed care, and general compliance will be assessed through review of staff training records and confidential interviews with staff and residents. - This is the first quarterly inspection. At visit, LPA reviewed training records and conducted interviews to assess supervision, emergency intervention procedures, trauma-informed care, and general compliance. The facility has shifted one of the administrators out of the day to day items and and is overseeing the program tasks but checks in at the facility. The other administrator is at the facility everyday for four hours and meets with the lead facility manager (house supervisor) every week. Additionally, staff now work in teams; there is a food team, activities team, mental health team, and medication team. The facility has staff training certificates from careprovider.org and maintains a training log on which staff sign verifying attendance and the trainer signs as well. The facility is also using a past checklist from the Department to train staff on general compliance in the facility and to be able to spot and correct issues during their shifts. The facility is using MANDT training for de-escalation and trauma-informed care and is finding this very helpful. The facility is getting away from consequences and now uses education and specific language and tone to redirect residents. Supervision is maintained so that staff provide direct supervision. If residents, for instance, go in the garage, outside, etc. a staff member will follow. If a resident states they want to go for a walk, a staff will go on a mental health walk with them. Additionally, the LIC 500 reflects 40 hours of Administrator and Program Director coverage, Monday-Friday lead facility manager (house supervisor) coverage, and facility manager coverage at all times residents are present. The facility is in the process of designating one of the current staff as the head of services and therapist, has received approval from the State, and is waiting to hear back from the county on their approval. The facility has hired a psychiatric nurse who comes to...\n\n... the facility to administer medications and who oversees the home health care needs of the residents. (2) The licensee will retrain all staff, including administrator(s) and facility manager(s), on personal rights, de-escalation procedures, and trauma-informed care. Staff will receive a minimum of 2 hours of training on each topic, for a total of 8 hours of training. For each topic, training must be from a source not affiliated with the licensee. All training will be completed within 120 days from the date of the NCC, and training certificates for each training will be maintained in staff training records and available for review. - The training is to be completed by 02/10/2023. The facility has increased the 2 hour training requirement to 8 hours on each topic. See narrative above. (3) The licensee will develop and submit to the Licensing agency by December 1, 2022 on the retraining, including job shadowing plan, for former administrator if they are to continue working at the facility. - The licensee completed the training plan and submitted on time to the Department. (4) The licensee will submit the bi-annual review of the facility's emergency intervention plan, per STRTP ILS Section 87095.22(h), by January 5, 2023. The plan will include a review of intervention methods used to de-escalate residents during altercations. - The licensee completed the biannual review and submitted on time to the Department. (5) The licensee will ensure that staff schedules reflecting facility manager and/or administrator coverage on site at all times residents are present are available for review at all visits. - LPA reviewed the LIC 500 and discussed with staff. See narrative above. (6) The licensee will notify the Licensing agency by December 1, 2022 if licensee would like to receive technical support services. - The licensee stated that the services did not meet their needs so were not utilized. No deficiencies were observed at this visit. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report left with Administrator, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

The terms from the NCC that require follow-up today are listed below. - The facility will be subject to frequent visits following this NCC, at which supervision, emergency intervention procedures, trauma-informed care, and general compliance will be assessed through review of staff training records and confidential interviews with staff and residents. - The licensee will ensure that staff schedules reflecting facility manager and/or administrator coverage on site at all times residents are present are available for review at all visits. During visit, LPA conducted confidential interviews with 2 staff and 1 resident. A second resident refused an interview, and the third resident was on an outing. LPA reviewed the staff schedules and observed that they reflect facility manager coverage on each shift. LPA requested the training records for all staff listed on the staff schedule, including Admistrators and mental health professionals for the months of May through July 2023. The records should also indicate how many hours of training have been completed by each staff since their hire date or 2023 anniversary date. Administrator agreed to submit by Friday 8/4/23.

    "narrative": "On 8/10/23, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a case management visit to follow-up on the noncompliance conference (NCC) held on 10/13/2022. This visit was a continuation of the visit on 7/28/23. LPA met with Administrator Mattie Marsh and informed of the purpose of the visit. During LPA's initial visit, LPA requested training records which were not available for review during the visit. During today's visit, LPA continued the review of training and personnel records and interviewed Administrator. During visit, LPA obtained and reviewed camera footage compiled by the licensee. On 7/31/23, LPA requested the footage for the month of July 2023. Licensee was unable to supply more than the past 11 days, and the footage was not continuous, resulting in gaps in the footage. Also, based on record review, interviews, and observations, a repairman who does not have a background clearance associated to the facility has performed work resulting in frequent presence at the facility. LPA advised that the facility ensure the required conditions (outlined in advisory note) are met to ensure the individual continues to be exempt from fingerprinting. Lastly, the following deficiencies were observed. See LIC 809-Ds and LIC 811 Confidential Names. Training records were not available for review during the initial visit on 7/28/23. Staff S3, S4, S5, and S7 are designated facility managers but their training records do not reflect facility manager training. Staff S3, S5, and S6 are designated facility managers and have been filling this role, but their files do not contain the facility manager job description reflecting training on job duties and only contain the signed direct care counselor job description.\n\nStaff S3, who was hired in July 2022, has only 16 hours of training reflected in their training record, which is less than the required 40 hours of annual training. Staff S2's training record does not reflect training on the core program model/approach Nurtured Heart Approach. Staff S2, S3, S5, and S8 have less than 24 hours of initial training reflected in their training records. Personnel files reflect signed consequence procedure acknolwedgements that are pulled from the old group home (GH) program statement, which do not align with the current, approved Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) program statement. The current STRTP program statement is not maintained on file. The old GH program statement was supplied to LPA upon request of the program statement, and the STRTP program statement could not be supplied at visit. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80066 Personnel Records and STRTP Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Sections 87065 Personnel Requirements, 87065.1 Supervision, Evaluation and Training Requirements, 87022 Plan of Operation, and 87022.1 Program Statement. Additionally, due to a repeat violation within 12 months of Section 87022(f), LPA is assessing an immediate civil penalty of $250. See LIC 421FC.

Staff offered to dial social worker for client and was denied by client.

LPA Pavia could not obtain transcripts of the 911 call to verify staff were given the direction to lock the client outside while waiting for officers to arrive. Client was outside of the facility for no more than 15 minutes. Staff purportedly informed law enforcement that client was attempting to get a knife from the staff office, not that client tried to stab staff.

LPA was met by Executive Director Maritza Jefferson who gave a tour of the interior and exterior areas of the facility's physical plant. There are no bodies of water on the premises; the front and back yards were free of clutter; and the passageways and egresses were unobstructed. No potentially hazardous items or areas were observed--there is a shed in the backyard that is lockable (it currently does not contain any potentially dangerous equipment). The facility has three bedrooms: the master bedroom has an en-suite full bathroom whose two vanity faucets provided hot water with temperature readings of 110 and 116 degrees Fahrenheit; the temperature reading for the hot water that the shower provided was 109.6; the toilet in that master bathroom was in working condition. There is also a common bathroom off the bedroom hallway: the toilet flushes, the vanity faucet's hot water temperature reading was 121.4, the shower's water temperature was 105.8. The kitchen faucet's hot water temperature reading was 110.2. The house has two refrigerators: one in the kitchen and one in the garage, both are in good working condition. There is also a sizeable walk-in pantry. The house is equipped with two fire extinguishers, one was located in the threshold between the receiving area/dining room, and the other was mounted on the back wall of the kitchen. The house has an office area immediately to the right of entering the house; Ms. Jefferson stated that this room, as well as the built-in cabinet in the office, will be securable as this is where confidential client and staff files will be housed. No structural defects to the house was observed by this LPA: the windows and window screens were in good repair and there were no unfinished areas. Per Ms. Jefferson, the beds, along with all other necessary furnishings for the bedrooms, will be procured shortly; cabinets, storage spaces, and all other areas that need to be inaccessible to future residents will also be secured (locking mechanisms to be installed, for example) by the next Prelicensing inspection. Ms. Jefferson was reminded that she could call this LPA directly for guidance should she have any Regulations-related questions to ensure compliance. A subsequent Prelicensing inspection will be conducted at a future date. A copy of this report is being provided to Ms. Jefferson.",

Ms. Ayers checked this LPA\u2019s temperature and proceeded to give a tour of the interior and exterior areas of the facility\u2019s physical plant: there is an office area where locked cabinets were located, one for confidential client and personnel records, within which the facility\u2019s \u2018sharps\u2019 were also housed, one for medications, and one for miscellaneous personal supplies for clients. The kitchen refrigerator contained perishable food items sufficient for at least three days, and next to it was a pantry cabinet stocked with non-perishable goods. Snack items were observed to be readily accessible for clients. An additional refrigerator/freezer was located in the garage area which had locked access from the dining area\u2014this refrigerator/freezer contained more perishable food items. Also in the garage area were more non-perishable items sufficient for at least seven days along with additional emergency supplies. The common bathroom\u2019s toilet, sink, and bathtub/shower were in working order. The clients\u2019 bedrooms were equipped with appropriate furnishings and sufficient storage spaces for personal possessions. The pathways and egresses were unobstructed and the facility\u2019s front and back yards were free of clutter. There is a locked shed in the backyard that mostly housed personal belongings of previous clients\u2014no potentially hazardous gardening or yard maintenance equipment was observed on the premises, and there were no indications that the facility has any firearms. The facility\u2019s license was posted in an accessible area along with the Emergency Disaster Plan. The property has no bodies of water. The facility is clean, sanitary, and in good repair.

    "narrative": "Based on interviews conducted during the investigation process the allegation facility staff did not provide transportation is substantiated because the facility did not provide transportation to work for a client in care on 11/29/22, 1/7/23, and 1/13/23. The facility\u2019s Program Statement states in section 3 the facility will provide clients transportation to employment. During three confidential interviews on 11/29/22 it was disclosed transportation needs of the client couldn\u2019t be met due to the facility only having one vehicle and distance of the client\u2019s workplace. The facilities Program Statement in section 7 also states there will be two agency authorized vehicles at the facility to ensure that adequate transportation needs are met. When LPA Carmona opened the complaint at the facility on 12/02/22 there was only one vehicle at the facility to ensure adequate transportation needs were met. In addition, two confidential interviews conducted on 12/02/22 corroborated that the facility had not had two vehicles for over a year. During 2 confidential interviews on 11/29/22 and 1 confidential interview on 12/02/22 it was disclosed the facility was not aware their Program Statement contained the terms in section 3 and 7. Although the facility was not aware of the terms in their Program Statement once LPA Carmona addressed them, they made sure to try and transport the client in care to and from work. 7 confidential interviews conducted from 11/29/22- 1/06/23 corroborated that the facility was accommodating transportation to and from work for the client in care to their best ability. Although the client was not provided transportation on 1/07/23 and 1/13/23 it was disclosed in a telephone conversation on 1/13/23 that the facility staff would not be driving in unsafe weather conditions to transport client to work. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, (ILS 87022.1), are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.\u201d) An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report and the Appeal Rights were provided to the House Manager.\n\nBased on interviews conducted during the investigation process on the allegation\u2019s facility is not providing medication to client cannot be substantiated because statements given in 3 of the 14 confidential interviews conducted on 12/02/22, 12/12/22, 1/06/23 corroborated the facility attempted to obtain medication refills for the client. In addition, case notes dated 11/20/22, daily logbook dated 11/23/22 and an email dated 11/29/22 prove that the facility staff was attempting to refill client\u2019s medication but were not able to reach the primary care physician.

As it relates to the allegation of staff not meeting minor\u2019s dietary needs, LPA conducted a review of the discharge paperwork/postoperative instructions and learned that the client was supposed to be on a soft diet which includes no sharp foods/chips. Client was given options by staff which included soft diet foods in the form of soups, popsicles, and ice cream which were declined. Although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are Unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were given. A copy of this report was provided to Supervisor, Chelsea Dailey.",

    "narrative": "At 10:19AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont met with the home above virtually over Microsoft Teams for the purpose of conducting a Case Management inspection. The purpose of this Case Management Inspection was to address incidents that were disclosed during Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives' interviews with facility staff and clients. LPA Fremont met with Former Administrator Maritza Jefferson, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance was LPA AmyLe Tran.. Currently in care are 4 ambulatory clients. In an interview with C2 on 05/04/2020 at 1PM, C2 stated that staff do not often check on clients when they are in common areas of the facility, and staff also do not enforce bedroom or bathroom rules. C2 explained that the clients will often go into each other's bedrooms to hang out, and also stated that clients will often go into the bathroom to use the toilet while another client is in the bathroom showering. These statements are corroborated by interviews with C3 on 05/04/2020 at 2PM, C4 on 05/04/2020 at 2:22PM, and C5 on 07/29/2020 at 8:25AM. In her interview, C3 stated that clients are not allowed in each other's bedrooms, but they often are anyway because staff are not always around to enforce the rules or catch clients violating the rules. When asked where staff usually are during shift, C3 responded the staff are usually in the office or in the living room. C3 also stated that sometimes staff will check on clients in common areas every 30 minutes, but other times they will go 2-3 hours without checking on clients. C4 stated in her interview that when clients are in their bedrooms, staff typically check on them every hour, however if they are in common areas of the house staff do not typically check on the clients. C5 reiterated these claims, reporting that staff were usually in the facility office or in the living room watching TV, and the clients would often go into each other's bedrooms because staff only performed checks every 1-2 hours. C5 also stated that S2 was the only staff who stayed on top of checking on the clients, but even then it was every other hour. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nThese statements are contradicted by interviews with S1 on 05/04/2020 at 3PM, S2 on 07/16/2020 at 1:15PM, S3 on 07/20/2020 at 10:51AM, and S4 on 07/20/2020 at 10:58AM. S1 stated that room checks were performed every 15-20 minutes, and client checks did not have a set timeline but were typically every 5, 10, or 15 minutes depending on the clients and their behaviors. S1 did acknowledge, however, that sometimes the bedroom rules were not enforced if the clients were doing each other's hair or borrowing clothing. S2 also stated that it was common to find clients sitting on each other's beds. S3 stated staff check on the clients every 15 minutes, and then later stated that checks were performed every 20-30 minutes. S3 also acknowledged that clients often broke the bedroom rules if they were doing each other's hair or makeup. S4 reiterated that clients were checked on every 15-20 minutes, however the house was small and they could often hear clients in other rooms of the house without doing checks. Finally, in follow-up interviews with C3 on 07/29/2020 at 1:59PM, and C5 on 08/03/2020, both clients reiterated that staff were not performing regular client checks. When asked if she feels safe at the home, C3 told Licensing staff she did not feel safe due to the behaviors of the other clients because staff, although present in the home, were not always in the same room as the clients to observe incidents. C5 confirmed this, relating to Licensing staff an incident that had occurred where C2 touched C5's breast and kissed C5 while watching a movie at night alone in the living room. At the time, staff were in the office and had not checked on the clients. Based on the information gathered, including interviews with staff and clients, there is a preponderance of evidence that direct dare staff at the home did not have the supervision of the clients as their main priority at the home by not performing routine client checks. A deficiency is being cited per Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1, Article 6, Section 87065.2(b)(1) - Personnel Duties. Please refer to the attached LIC809-D for more details. At this time, one deficiency is being cited.

    "narrative": "On 05/04/2020 at approximately 1PM, Investigator Austin conducted an interview with C2. C2 stated that she and C1 had a relationship at the home. She stated C1 would try to put her hands in her pants and C2 would push her away. When asked where in the home this had happened, C2 stated that it happened in the living room, the \"front room\", the bathroom, and the facility office. When asked where staff was during these incidents, C2 stated that staff did not check on clients often when they were in common areas. This statement is corroborated by interviews with C3, C4, and C5, who stated that staff usually check on clients every 30 minutes when clients are in their bedrooms, and staff do not usually check on clients in common areas. All clients stated that staff are usually in the office or in the living room watching TV. In her interview, C2 also disclosed to Investigator Austin two separate incidents that had happened involving her and C1 in the front room of the home. C2 described that on the day of 12/07/2019, all clients were hanging out in the front room of the house when C3 threw something at C2. C2 refused to give the item back to C3, and C3 responded by holding a butter knife to C2's neck. C2 told staff, who did not take the allegation seriously. On the same day, C2 described that she was doing wrestling moves on C1, when C1 put her finger in C2's buttocks. Both of these incidents are corroborated by interviews with C3 on 05/04/2020 at 2PM, C4 on 05/04/2020 at 2:22PM, and C5 on 07/29/2020 at 8:25AM. In C3's interview, she stated that all clients were in the front room getting ready to leave for an outing, when she threw her phone at C2. C2 would not give the phone back, so C3 held a butter knife to C2's neck. C2 responded by doing a wrestling move on C3, and while C2 was standing over C3, C1 put her toe in C2's buttocks. C4 also stated that C3 held a butter knife to C2's neck, but only heard about C1 touching C2 inappropriately as she had left the room already. C5 also stated that she witnessed the butter knife incident, and later heard about C1 touching C2 inappropriately. This is contradicted by a statement made by C1 in an interview on 05/04/2020 at 9AM. When asked if she had ever had any incidents with C2, C1 stated \"of course.\" C1 went on to deny ever touching C2 or any of the other clients in an inappropriate manner. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nIn an interview with S1 on 05/04/2020 at 3PM, S1 stated that she did not hear about the incident between C1 and C2 until the next day. S1 was informed by other staff that C2 had been doing wrestling moves on C1, and C1 had poked C2 in her buttocks. S1 acknowledged that she did not question any of the clients about this incident, and it was not talked about again until the police were involved approximately a month later. In an interview with S2 on 07/16/2020 at 1:15PM, S2 stated that on the day of 12/07/2019, C1 and C3 had come into the kitchen to complain that C2 was doing wrestling moves on them. C2 came into the kitchen to defend herself and asked S2 to \"Tell C1 not to put her finger up my ass.\" C1 denied this happening, and S2 goes on to describe that all the girls left the kitchen laughing, so she and other staff did not take the allegation seriously , and did not question any of the girls further on the matter. No incident report was made. A week later, the incident with the butter knife was reported and as a result, the home removed all of its butter knives with serrated edges. In the coming months, C3 would disclose to S2 the incident when C1 touched C2 inappropriately. S2 stated that after C2 filed a police report regarding the incident, other staff at the home instructed her to retroactively fill out an incident report and date it back to December of 2019. In an interview with S3 on 07/20/2020 at 10:51AM, S3 stated that she found out about the incident between C1 and C2 a few days after it happened. She was told by other staff that C1 and C2 had been playing when it turned aggressive and C1 touched C2 in her buttocks. The other staff on duty was S4, who was at the grocery store at the time of the incident. Finally, in follow-up interviews with C3 on 07/29/2020 at 1:45PM and C5 on 07/29/2020 at 8:25AM, both clients stated that C2 had also been touching clients in an inappropriate manner. C3 stated an incident happened where she was sitting on the couch in the living room with C2 and C5, when C2 reached down and put her hand on C3 and C5's breasts. Both C3 and C5 removed themselves from the situation and went to their shared bedroom. This is corroborated by statements made by C5, who said that C2 had touched her breast and had also kissed her in the living room. Both clients indicated that staff were in the facility office during these incidents and had not been performing regular client checks. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nStatements from staff, clients, and review of facility documents suggest that clients of the home were left unsupervised on multiple occasions and that inappropriate touching between clients occurred during these times. While it is unclear which client definitively touched which other clients, statements overall support that inappropriate touching between clients did occur, and C1 touched C2 on the buttocks in an unwanted and inappropriate manner. Based on the information gathered, including staff and client interviews and review of facility files, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove that a lack of care and supervision resulted in a client being sexually assaulted by another client while in care. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. The licensee is being cited per Title 22 Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80078(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Additionally, due to the substantiated allegation above, and based on interviews with staff, clients, and review of facility files, the licensee denied its clients the personal right to live in a home free from physical or sexual abuse by repeatedly allowing clients to be unsupervised in the home, resulting in inappropriate touching between clients. The licensee is being cited per Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1, Article 6, Section 87072(d)(11) - Personal Rights. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Two deficiencies are being cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights discussed and provided, Plan of Correction discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to Paradise Adolescent Home with read receipt due to COVID-19 precautions.",

    "narrative": "At 1:06PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont met with the home above over Microsoft Teams for the purpose of addressing incidents that were disclosed during Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives' interviews with facility staff and clients. The purpose of the second portion of this inspection was to conduct a Regional Office-Initiated Informal Meeting with the Licensee. LPA met with Paradise Adolescent Home (PAH) Administrator Biana Jones, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance were PAH Executive Director Maritza Jefferson, PAH Clinician Susan Carol, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong, and LPA AmyLe Tran. Currently in care are 4 ambulatory clients. (See LIC811 - Confidential Names dated 10/29/2020) In interviews with C1 on 05/04/2020 at 1300 hours, C2 on 05/04/2020 at 1400 hours, C3 on 05/04/2020 at 1500 hours, and C4 on 07/29/2020 at 0825 hours, all clients reported to CCL representatives that on one occasion, all clients had been in the front room of the house, when C1 took something of C2's and refused to give it back. In response, C2 held a serrated-edge butter knife to C1's neck. C1 then fought back by doing a wrestling move on C2, and threw C2 on her back. C3 added that C1 had a mark on her neck from the butter knife for days following this incident, and staff did not document it. C1 stated that when she tried to report the incident to staff, staff asked her why she hadn't just called them. All clients interviewed stated that this incident occurred while the clients were unsupervised for an extended amount of time. In an interview with S1 on 07/16/2020 at 1315 hours, S1 confirmed that this incident had occurred, however she had not found out about it until weeks later when C1 reported it to her. S1 asked C2 if this was true, and C2 confirmed it had happened. As a result, the facility removed all of its butter knives with serrated edges. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nBased on the information gathered, client and staff statements support that C2 held a butter knife to C1's neck while clients were unsupervised in the facility. A deficiency is being cited per Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1, Article 6, Section 87078(b) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. Additionally, in an interview with S1 on 07/16/2020 at 1315 hours, S1 stated that on 12/07/2019, an incident had occurred where inappropriate touching between clients was reported. When the incident was originally reported by C1 on 12/07/2019, S1 stated that because the clients were laughing and joking, they did not take the allegation seriously and did not write an incident report. S1 stated that the following month, C1 reported the incident from 12/07/2019 to police and an investigation was launched. S1 went on to explain that once more information started to come out and CCL was notified, staff had S1 document the incident to \"cover themselves\". S1 explained she filled out two incident reports early in January 2020, one for the butter knife incident and one for the inappropriate touching incident, as both incidents had happened on the same day (12/07/2019), and staff instructed S1 to back date the reports. Upon further investigation of these incident reports, it was found the reports were backdated to 12/16/2019 and signed off by a supervisor on 12/17/2019 as the day they were completed, although the incident occurred on 12/07/2019. S1 ended her interview by stating it was management who had instructed her to back date the reports. Based on the information gathered, staff at the home did not fill out incident reports at the time the incidents occurred, and dates were fabricated on the reports showing an earlier date than they were actually written. A deficiency is being cited per Title 22 Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80061(b)(1)(E) - Reporting Requirements. Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. The second portion of this inspection focused on conducting a Regional Office-Initiated Informal Meeting, with the purpose of addressing obstacles the home has faced since its transition from Group Home to Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP), and to create a plan for the home to come back into compliance with CCL regulations. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nCCL called this meeting due to the facility facing recent challenges with operations, as well as to address recent deficiencies that the home was cited for. Specific challenges the facility has faced since STRTP licensure are as follows: 1. Staff training (specifically on Personal Rights, Care and Supervision, Reporting Requirements, and Personnel Duties 2. Staffing and Administration, including hours spent at the home and competency of facility staff on caring for STRTP level clients 3. Supervision of staff, including how the home ensures staff are preforming all of their duties 4. Appropriate client interactions 5. Enforcing program rules Proposed Plan: 1. The Licensee will submit an updated and current LIC500 - Staff Roster, to ensure that the Administrator is present in the home for at least 20 hours per week during normal working hours (Monday-Friday, 8AM-5PM), and to ensure adequate staff coverage at all times. Please submit no later than end of business hours on 10/30/2020. 2. CCL will offer the facility assistance from their Technical Support Program (TSP), during which time the facility will not be subject to enforcement actions and will receive guidance from the Department on how to regain compliance. Timeline to be determined by Licensee, should they agree to the offered assistance. 3. The Licensee will retrain all facility staff on Personal Rights, Reporting Requirements, Care and Supervision, Personnel Duties, Prudent Parenting Standards, and Administrative Duties.

The Licensee will make note of any supervision changes in case notes as necessary, and continue to fill out the log book as usual. Starting December 2020 and continuing through June 2021, the licensee will submit log book notes and case notes for the 7th day of each month, to be submitted no later than the 29th of every month. 5. Beginning December 2020 and continuing through July 2021, the Licensee will ensure that all staff are fulfilling all of their personnel duties at the home, by conducting quarterly audits that address any staffing issues and identify what staff are doing well, as well as things that could be improved on. Quarterly staff audits shall be submitted no later than end of business hours on 01/03/2021, 04/01/2021, 07/01/2021.

During an investigation at the facility, LPA reviewed MARs and psychotropic MARs (PMARs) for residents in care at the facility for the months of April and May 2020. LPA observed that there were some minor inconsistencies, including medications not being listed under the month in which they were prescribed. For resident R1's (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 4/20/21) MARs, Hydroxyzine is listed as a prescribed medication administered in April and May, but it is only listed on the prescribed medication list on the April log and not the May log. Additionally, not all administered psychotropic medications were documented on PMARs. For R1's records, Prazosin, Hydroxyzine, and Rizatriptan were documented on PMARs, but Clonazepam and Levetiracetam were not. Both of the latter medications are anticonvulsants, which are categorized as psychotropic medications, and should be documented on PMARs, even if administration is on an as-needed basis. No citations were issued at this visit. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Executive Director Maritza Jefferson, who agreed to receive an emailed copy of this report and return a signed copy.",

R1 does have a history of ingesting substances with intent to cause harm to self, but R1 was prescribed to multiple medications at the time and reported not thinking anything of being administered two cups of medications. S1 immediately realized that the first cup was empty and that R1 had taken those as well. R1 was told to try to throw up and was taken to the ER for a possible overdose. R1 was put on an IV and then released with no issues. The youth did not overdose but did have an excessive intake of psychotropic medication. The facility reported the incident to the required parties, and S1 was written up for not following the program's policy on medication administration. The facility also held a staff training on 6/3/20 to specifically address medication storage and administration. S1 was in attendance and completed a training questionnaire afterwards. LPA reviewed documentation of the training, sign-in sheet, and S1's post-training questionnaire. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated.

Based on interviews and record review, on 5/28/20, staff S1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 4/20/21) was preparing medication for administration to two youth by placing their medications in cups. Staff called youth to come and take their medication. While S1 was waiting for the youth, S1 continued preparing the medication. Youth R1 walked up and took the cup of medication on the table that S1 had already prepared but which was for another youth. S1 did not see this and handed R1 their cup of medication, which R1 took.

The home was observed to be clean and free from hazards. The home is one story, with a kitchen, living room, family room, staff office, two full bathrooms, and 3 bedrooms which each house 2 clients. One bathroom is shared by the clients, and one bathroom is located in the staff office. Each room was observed to be well lit and all light bulbs functional. Each bedroom was equipped with 2 twin beds and ample storage space for clients' belongings. All hallways and passageways were observed to be free from obstruction. LPA toured the backyard, which was free from hazards. The backyard is surrounded by a fence on 3 sides. No bodies of water on the premises. LPA observed at least 7 days of nonperishable food and at least 2 days of perishable food in the kitchen refrigerator. The facility license, weekly menu, activities calendar, and client Personal Rights were posted prominently in the home. Sharps and chemicals are kept locked and inaccessible to clients. Medications are centrally stored in the staff office. During this inspection, LPA reviewed 3 client records and 3 staff records. All client records were complete with all required elements.

    "narrative": "In an interview with W1 on 02/24/2021, W1 stated that during a recent provider meeting for C1 on 02/17/2021, W8 had reported that C1 was regularly smoking marijuana as part of their coping skills when they were depressed or feeling anxious. Per W1, W8 continued by saying C1 was allowed to take daily 10 minute walks in the neighborhood to smoke marijuana outside, and didn't see a need to make C1 stop because it was the only coping skill C1 had. In interviews with C1, C2, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, W7, W8, and W9, all interviewees stated that smoking was never allowed inside or outside of the facility, and that staff would never grant permission for a client to smoke marijuana as a coping mechanism. C2 stated they had never seen C1 smoking in the home, has never heard of it being an issue at the home, and stated the clients were not allowed to smoke as a coping skill. W2 and W3 both stated they had never heard of any complaints of inappropriate behavior or drug use at the home. W2, W7, and W8 all stated they were aware that C1 smokes marijuana, but that C1 had never done it on facility property and it would not be permitted. C1 denied this allegation, stating they never smoked inside or outside of the facility. In regard to W1's statement that W8 reported C1 was smoking in the facility as a coping skill, W8 stated this was false, that smoking was not allowed even for coping. W8 denied telling anyone they had given C1 permission to smoke, and that C1 was allowed to go on walks but not for the purpose of smoking. W7 and W4 both stated that marijuana paraphernalia had been found once during a room search of C1's room, but confirmed C1 had never smoked in the home. W5 also conducted an investigation into this incident for their own agency, and found the allegation to be unfounded based on interviews with staff and clients. During this investigation, there was insufficient evidence to substantiate that staff allowed C1 to smoke marijuana. C1 initially disclosed that facility staff allowed them to smoke in the backyard, but later declined to speak further on the matter because they stated it was untrue. Although the allegation \"Staff is allowing a minor to smoke marijuana while in care\" may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Sabrina Shelton, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

(See LIC811 - Confidential Names dated 11/24/2021). On 05/11/2021, the San Jose Children's Residential Program Regional Office received a complaint for Paradise Home with two allegations: (1) \"Staff mishandled a minor while in care,\" and (2) \"Staff did not seek timely medical attention for a minor while in care.\" On 06/04/2021, LPA AmyLe Tran traveled to the home to notify the licensee of these allegations and to request relevant documentation. LPA Fremont returned to the home on 11/18/2021 to collect additional documentation and to conduct interviews with staff and clients. Regarding these allegations, LPA Fremont conducted interviews with 2 clients and 5 staff. LPA obtained the following information: According to all those who were interviewed, if a client expresses to staff that they are feeling sick or injured, the staff protocol is to immediately offer the client medical attention, either by making an appointment at the nearest urgent care during normal business hours or by taking the client to the closest emergency room if no appointments are available. All those interviewed stated there was no reason that staff would ever deny a client medical attention, although clients were able to refuse treatment if they wanted. Neither of the clients who were interviewed were living at the home when these allegations were reported, and could not speak to the incident in question. All staff who were interviewed stated that the client named in this complaint (C1) had a history of aggression and making false allegations about staff. All staff stated that C1 had been the aggressor for the duration of the incident on 05/07/2021, and had been making verbal threats and exhibiting physical aggression toward the staff involved. It was reported that San Ramon Police responded to this incident after C1 called 911, and both officers agreed with staff that the client had been the aggressor, and they did not feel the need to make a report for the incident. It is noted in the incident report dated 05/07/2021 and in staff shift notes for the same day that C1 had taken a video of the incident, but upon showing the video to the police, C1 was told that it only showed her being the aggressor toward staff, and that she needed to go to bed. All staff interviewed corroborated this information, but did not know where a copy of this video could be found as it was never provided to the licensee. All staff stated that the client had reported their foot was injured during the incident, but the client did not report this to the responding officers, and the client did not mention an injury or request medical attention at all in the days following the incident. The staff involved stated they would have offered the client medical attention if they had requested it, but did not because the client did not show any observable signs of injury. These statements are corroborated by an incident report dated 05/07/2021, as well as the staff shift notes for the day of the incident. LPA Fremont attempted to contact the client involved, the responding officers, and the complainant several times over the course of this investigation, but was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a response. This agency has investigated the allegations (1) \"Staff mishandled a minor while in care,\" and (2) \"Staff did not seek timely medical attention for a minor while in care,\" and has found that althought the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

Staff member informed LPA that previous visits this was not an issue to leave powdered laundry detergent out in a locked garage. LPA Lam observed a broken chair in the garage. The leg of the chair is broken. LPA asked staff member when did it occur. Staff member informs it may have happened several months ago. LPA observed a broken bathroom sink counter inside the bathroom. Broken piece was removed, however edges of the counter is sharp and in access to clients. Staff member informs the incident happened recently and maintenance is supposedly coming to the facility 07/11/2024 to fix the broken counter. LPA observed broken door knob for one of the client's bedrooms. Staff member informs incident occurred 07/10/2024 overnight. Staff member informs LPA that door knob is supposed to fix the broken door knob as well. If maintenance does not come, staff member said another staff member will put on the door knob as of 07/11/2024 overnight. During the inspection of clients' safeguards for cash resources, LPA observed inaccurate records of accounts pertaining to cash resources. Staff member explains process of recording cash records were: client was to ask and receive a certain amount of cash (recorded under Amount Received), client was to spend the certain amount of cash (Amount Spent), hence Balance results in $0.\n\nHowever, transactions were solely recorded of how much money was given and used to clients. It does not overall reflect allowance earned and saved by client. No citations were issued at this visit. An exit interview was conducted and appeals rights was discussed to Shift Supervisor Ava Ballard. A copy of the report was emailed to the facility.",

LPA met with Shift Supervisor Ava Ballard and informed of the purpose of the visit. An IR was submitted for an incident that occurred on 11/13/2024. According to the IR, it was reported that two clients, C1 and C2, got into an altercation at school. As a result, C2 made a threat to C1, instructing them not to talk about what happened. This incident is related to CSEC. The Shift Supervisor further explained that both clients were brought back in separate car rides and when they got back home they seemed fine. In the following days, an emergency CFT meeting was planned and conducted on 11/18/2024. During the meeting, the clients' behaviors were discussed, as well as their problems with CSEC. C1's mother confirmed that she had been involved with CSEC prior to arriving at the facility, and not because of the other client. Additionally, a safety plan has been created, and discussed several rules that C1 signed and has to abide by. On Monday, MeeChell Williams, a Human Trafficking Case Specialist from Community Violence Solutions, will begin providing ongoing support for C1. LPA reviewed the safety plan and conducted a confidential interview with Shift Supervisor. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited.

    "narrative": "On 06/18/21 at 1:30 PM, the second collaborative a quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learning was embraced by about half of the clientele, with the other half preferring in-person learning.\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021. A copy of this report will be emailed for signatures to Laynee Kuhn.",

Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and time-frames be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled.",

LPA made the visit to discuss the following incident reports for this facility: On 6/27/21 C1 left to the store while staff was in the kitchen. While at the store youth was asking for cigarettes and customer called law enforcement who then returned youth to the facility. LPA inquired as to whether staff were even aware of youth's absence prior to law enforcement returning youth to the facility. Ms. Kuhn states that she believed On 5/5/21 C2 threw a bowl of cereal at staff's back after one staff denied having a conversation C2 claimed to have had with C2. The incident appeared to possibly be confrontational between the C2 and staff. LPA learned that C2 has a history of being confrontation and volatile with staff and facility is working with C2 on tempers and reactiveness to situations as C2 could have responded the same if staff had not responded about the alleged conversation. Agency did not see this as confrontational or out of line for staff during this incident. On 4/23/21, C3 was playing with fire while in the facility living room. LPA asked Ms. Kuhn about contacting law enforcement following incidents of this nature and Ms. Kuhn states that they have historically contacted law enforcement but are typically told that they will not respond unless there is an active fire in progress. If staff are successful in putting out the fire, there is no need to respond. This was discussed during C3's child and family team meeting and youth is currently no longer in this placement. Facility typically will not accept youth with fire starting behaviors. LPA discussed with Ms. Kuhn the additional clarification needed on the reports to ensure all details including antecedents and follow up are captured appropriately. No citations were issued as a result of this inspection. Document provided to Ms. Kuhn.",

S1\u2019s file was reviewed and copies obtained, including: LIC 501, Employee Address Change Form, Child Abuse Reporting Policy, Statement Acknowledging Requirement to Report Suspected Child Abuse, Allegation of Abuse and Social Media,\n\nTraining Logs, S1\u2019s Statements dated 12/13/2019 and 12/20/2019, two photos of S1\u2019s iPad, email dated 12/20/2019, Communication Notes dated 12/18/2019 and 12/19/2019, and S4\u2019s Statement dated 12/18/2019 (see LIC 811 dated 7/27/2021). LPA Johnson conducted another Case Management visit on 2/12/2020 with Stephanie Fisher, Program Director and obtained copies of two incident reports of staff witnessing S1 return to two POYS facilities and transporting NMD, after being terminated, three Communication Notes dated 1/28/2020 and 2/10/2020 (see LIC 811 dated 7/27/2021). On 3/4/2020, POYS provided notification that when a former staff resigned, he alleged that NMD is having a sexual relationship with S1 and S1 is pregnant. A Suspected Child Abuse Report was made on 3/12/2020 and Investigator Jami Eaton was assigned to investigate this case on 3/16/2021. Interviews were conducted from 12/31/2020-6/2/2020 with S1, Probation Officer Winifred Temple, NMD and six current or former POYS staff (see LIC811 dated 7/27/2021). The allegation is whether S1 had a sexual relationship with NMD when NMD was a minor client of POYS. NMD was placed on 8/26/2019, turned 18 years old on 10/4/2019, and S1 was terminated on 12/20/2019. Both S1 and NMD denied there was a sexual relationship. Two staff directly heard statements from NMD admitting to having a sexual relationship with S1, however the statements did not indicate when the relationship began. So it is not possible to determine if the relationship occurred while S1 was employed by POYS (See LIC811 dated 7/27/2021). Based on the investigation, interviews conducted and records reviewed, the complaint allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation is meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted. Facility signature is on hard copy. A copy of all reports and appeal rights were provided to the facility via email.",

Additionally, a search of the youth\u2019s person was conducted where the youth was asked to empty their pockets\u2014no \u201cpat-down\u201d search is allowed in the facility. Law enforcement was also called and responded\u2014this first search yielded no discovery of a weapon. After a second time that the threat was purportedly made again and upon this being reported to staff, another search was conducted with the involvement of law enforcement, at which time a folding knife was found on the suspected youth\u2019s person\u2014that youth was then detained by the responding officers. No other youths interviewed attested to seeing the suspected youth actually brandishing the weapon, nor did any of the interviewed staffers state that they saw the weapon before it was discovered. Beyond threats made by the suspected youth, no other youths were actually harmed due to this ordeal. On the allegation that there are Altercations between youths at the facility, though physical fights sometimes took place in the facility, no youths interviewed reported non-action on the part of the staff. The youths corroborated that staff do intervene when a physical fight breaks out between youths. Reviewed training records show that staff are educated on de-escalation techniques and, when needed, application of restraints. It is not a reasonable expectation that no altercations between youths happen in the facility\u2014only that facility staff attempt to de-escalate situations or intervene when a physical fight does occur. Corroborating statements by youths indicate that staff do their part in this regard. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur; therefore, the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED. No citations are being issued as a result of this investigation; a copy of this report along with a copy of the Appeal Rights are being provided to the facility.",

    "narrative": "On 06/18/21 at 1:30 PM, the second collaborative a quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learning was embraced by about half of the clientele, with the other half preferring in-person learning.\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021. A copy of this report will be emailed for signatures to Laynee Kuhn.",

Three locations: Madison, Sunset and Old Auburn currently have no foster youth placed. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Johnson, LPA, Tammy Hill, LPA \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director POYS reported a staff and family moved into Sunset after their home burned down approximately 2 weeks ago. Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested.

LPA made the visit to discuss the following incident reports for this facility: C1 (see LIC811 dated 9/24/21) attempted to leave the facility on a bicycle and when youth returned, the bicycle was locked up and it was not clear if that was an attempt to deter youth from leaving or if it was staff locking up the bike because it was being used as a mode of transportation. C2 brought into the facility a bb gun that was not authorized to be with youth in the program. The facility confiscated the weapon and attempted to have law enforcement come and retrieve the weapon as it looked a real. Facility was informed that they were going to need to destroy the weapon themselves and that law enforcement would not take possession. LPA discussed with Ms. Kuhn the additional clarification needed on the reports to ensure all details including antecedents and follow up are captured appropriately. No citations were issued as a result of this inspection. Document provided to Ms. Kuhn.",

    "narrative": "three to five days to receive the results. The facility did not attempt to obtain results until August 16, 2021. Documentation obtained during the investigation indicates that youth were tested August 12, 2021, and their results were ready as of August 14, 2021. Test results were obtained verbally from the clinic. Until a subsequent visit to the facility on January 27, 2022, the facility did not have any documentation of the test results in question. Facility Administrator went to the clinic during the LPA's visit and obtained the documentation because it was not obtained previously. Amongst the results, there was one positive youth and two youth's results indicate that COVID was \"Not Detected\" and the narrative of the results states \"re-testing should be considered\" but these two youth were not re-tested. During the time from the date of the test to the date of the receipt of the COVID results these youth were not isolating in their rooms and were potentially exposing staff and other youth. The youth that was in the hospital for another reason returned to the facility on August 15, 2022, was retested but was in isolation in their room until their test results were received August 17, 2022 indicating they were negative. As a result of the information obtained, interviews conducted and documentation received, the allegation that the facility did not obtain the youths' COVID test results in a timely manner is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. Facility was cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 80070(b)(9) Client Records. Licensees are required to maintain a separate, complete, and current record in the facility for each client that also includes, but is not limited to, record of any illness or injury requiring treatment... The facility took four youth for COVID testing on August 12, 2021, but did not obtain the written documentation of the COVID testing results as necessary to meet the intent of this regulation. The written documentation was not obtained from the clinic until January 27, 2022. Facility obtained the COVID testing results via phone on August 16, 2022, but the results of the verbal contact with the clinic was not documented in client files. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Kuhn and documents provided along with appeal rights.\n\nWhen LPA interviewed staff about COVID-19 protocols, it was discussed that staff were not sure what part they play in mitigating the spread of COVID outside of cleaning multiple times throughout the facility and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and protocols. Staff also confirmed that they feel that COVID is so new and ever-evolving that they aren't confident that they could be trained in a thorough manner either. Confidential interviews revealed that while staff some have been trained to clean, maintain social distancing, wear masks and wash their hands often, they feel that the agency could provide additional training on how all of these measures are helpful and what other things they could do. Some staff insisted that they have not received any training related to COVID mitigation and prevention at the facility. The allegation that the facility is not following their emergency plan to protect clients and staff is related to staff feeling that Paradise Oaks administrative staff asked at least one staff to return to work once their quarantine and/or isolation period was over regardless of still being symptomatic. LPA attempted to speak to this staff person about the circumstances but staff refused to be interviewed. Other confidential interviews revealed that a staff person reported to other staff that they were cleared to return to work regardless of still being symptomatic. This situation made staff question facility's policies to mitigate the spread of COVID, further creating the potential for additional spread of COVID. Confidential interviews revealed that said staff did not return to work and forfeited their position with the agency. Other interviews revealed that staff are trained and constantly reminded and trained that they are not to return to work if they are experiencing any COVID-related symptoms. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted, and documentation reviewed, the allegations that facility staff are not properly training on COVID protocols, facility is not following their emergency plan, and facility failed to implement mitigating factors that created additional exposure to clients and staff are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Kuhn and documents provided along with appeal rights.",

LPA Hill made a subsequent visit to the facility on 10/19/2021 where LPA Hill requested that the agency provide a copy of the COVID training plan for staff, protocols for youth and any other cleaning, sanitizing or other COVID protocols established for the mitigation of the spreading COVID within the facility. Another subsequent visit was conducted on 1/27/22 to the facility to obtain additional documentation. LPA Hill conducted interviews with clients and staff from 10/19/21 to 1/20/22. At least one staff did not respond to repeated requests for interview. The allegation that the facility did not obtain COVID test results in a timely manner is related to an incident on August 10, 2021, where one youth was taken to the hospital for another reason and was COVID tested. The hospital alerted the facility staff that youth had tested positive so all the remaining youth were taken to a clinic for tests on August 12, 2021.

During this inspection, 5 out of 5 Direct Care Staff and 5 out of 5 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 5 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 5 youth were interviewed.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA David Torres observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Carla Izzarelli, Administrator.",

LPA and LPM met with Carla Izzarelli, Administrator, to deliver the licensing report findings of a case management inspection conducted on May 25, 2022 for five special incident reports (SIR) received for medication errors. The facility was toured both inside and out with Carla Izzarelli, Manager. No clients were present during inspection. Interviews were conducted with Misha Scott, Medication Manager and Carla Izzarelli, Administrator. During the investigation three staff records were reviewed, one client record was reviewed (see LIC 811 \u2013 Confidential Names List dated 5/25/2022), medications were reviewed, two medications counted, MAR records for April and May were reviewed, training records were reviewed for S3, S4 and S5. \u00b7 SIR dated May 25, 2022 \u2013C1 was mistakenly given his p.m. prescription medication in the a.m. on May 23, 2022. \u00b7 SIR dated April 26, 2022 \u2013 C1 was two tablets short for two prescription medications. C1 was one 1 tablet short for a prescription medication. Staff are unsure if the pills were dropped or the client was given an extra pill and there was no notation of the missing medication. \u00b7SIR dated April 22, 2022 \u2013 C1 was not given a prescription medication because staff replaced the bubble pack prescription with an over the counter bottle due to the prescription not being filled and staff did not read or recognize the new packaging. SIR dated April 8, 2022 \u2013 C1 was missing one tablet of a prescription medication. Staff is unclear if he was given a double dose or if one was dropped. \u00b7 SIR dated April 4, 2022 - C1 was missing one prescription medication. Staff is unsure if C1 was given an extra dose or if one fell on the ground. There was no notation of the missing medication.\n\nThe medication manager checks the medications and the MARs on Mondays and Fridays. The administrator said they thought the errors could be attributed to the rotation of on call staff, Agency wide, who are not familiar with the houses or clients and the medication distribution process. The administrator also said she was working on a plan to have only permanent staff dispense medications and a plan to improving the medication dispensing process. Facility is cited for California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Section 80065 (a) \u2013 Personnel Requirements. Record reviews and interviews conducted confirms multiple medication errors were made by means of lack of documentation, dispensing or not properly reading labels.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth\u2019s monthly safety plan, and crisis intervention plan, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Mac observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Carla Izzarelli.",

ASW stated that the incident with C1 was because C1 was a new client to their facility and the pharmacy made some error while filing C1's prescription. Additionally, that C1 was not a patient of their regular facility doctor. They contacted both their doctor and the pharmacy and the error has been corrected and they have not had any confusion since then. An additional report was discussed involving C2 in the same facility with same error. ASW stated they had a staff from another facility who worked the shift and she did not receive the report about the medication and so she did not give the client their medication for that shift because she did not know they had not been given at the time she showed up for work.

Based on video footage provided by the reporting party, LPA Crass observed staff member (S2) casually eating and on their cell phone, while clients had put a chair on a table, to climb on to an awning, to get on to the roof. While the children were on the roof, the staff member was looking down at their cell phone, and then was watching a youth on the roof, while eating. The staff member did not appear to be preventing the child from being on the roof, or verbalizing for them to get down. The staff member eventually walks back inside the house. Additionally, two youth can be seen vaping in the video, one of which vaped right in front of the staff member, with no intervention from S2 being observed. Based on record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Interim Licensing Standards, Article 6, 87065.2(b)(1) is being cited on the attached LIC 9099D. An exit interview was conducted with Carla Izzarelli. A copy of this report and appeal rights were given.\n\nIt was reported that sometime in 2021 or 2022, youth in care were hiding from the fire department at night, and that staff had locked the back door so the youth could not enter the facility. LPA Crass investigated the above allegation. Based upon information obtained during the investigation, LPA received conflicting statements from interviews, and was not able to observe youth being locked out of the home in video footage, therefore this allegation has been found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

The reporting party was interviewed on 5-12-20, the facility social worker was interviewed on 7-29-20 and the youth was interviewed on 8-11-20 (see LIC811 Confidential Names List dated 5-11-20). It was alleged that the facility staff did not follow child\u2019s needs and services plan by not providing weekly therapy sessions with the facility social worker. According to documents between the time period of 8-5-19 to 6-5-20, the youth refused to meet with the facility social worker six times. On 3-24-20, the facility social worker attempted to contact the youth but did not get a response. On 2-25-20 it was decided that the youth would start having bi-weekly therapy sessions. According to the youth, one or two therapy sessions were held at the facility with the facility social worker. Documents indicate that some sessions took place in the community. The facility social worker was on modified duty from 8-16-19 until 9-6-19 but it is not documented if anyone else provided therapy for the youth. There is not any documentation of therapy for the month of September 2019. The initial needs and services plan dated 8-5-19 was provided to this LPA from the agency. The needs and services plan should be updated every thirty days. The agency was unable to provide an updated needs and services.

    "narrative": "On 09/17/21 at 1:00 PM, the third collaborative quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 27. Three locations: Madison, Sunset and Old Auburn currently have no foster youth placed. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Johnson, LPA, Tammy Hill, LPA \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director POYS reported a staff and family moved into Sunset after their home burned down approximately 2 weeks ago. Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled",

The incident report for the missed medications was received on April 18, 2025 however, Community Care Licensing (CCL) did not receive any 24Hr reports regarding the multiple incidents. Interviews conducted confirmed that a staff member had given a client in care medication that seemed to be \"moldy\". Staff informed that the medication was not moldy but was wet, altering the appearance and client did not want to consume the medication. It was also confirmed by the facility administrator that the medication became wet due to the water cup dripping into the pill cup. In addition, medication was not administered correctly and a client in care was given an additional dose of medication on April 8, 2025, April 9, 2025, April 10, 2025, and April 11, 2025. Additionally, on April 25, 2025 the client was only given a single dose of a required double dosage of medication. Based on LPA Turner's observations and interviews which were conducted and records reviewed, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Exit interview conducted, a copy of this report and the Appeal Rights were discussed and provided to the licensee.\n\nSeven out of the nine interviews conducted confirmed the allegations staff did not provide a safe environment for minor(s), staff did not safeguard minor\u2019s personal property, and staff made inappropriate comments in the presence of minor did not occur. During the investigation LPA Turner was informed by clients in care that they feel safe in the home. Several clients expressed their appreciation of staff members and how well taken care of they are in the facility. Staff informed LPA Turner that they provide a safe environment for clients in care and a safe place for client's belongings. Clients informed that they have space to keep personal belongings and that they have never heard staff making inappropriate comments around them. Three out of four clients stated that staff are very mindful of what they say around them while in care. During the interviews, LPA Turner was notified that clients in care misplace their personal belongings and they have seen other clients in care break or mishandle their belongings to try and get staff or other clients in trouble. Clients confirmed that they have removed some belongings from their room due to incontinence issues from other clients in care. Staff interviewed denied the above allegations regarding inappropriate comments and clients stated that staff only talk about the health and safety of clients in care. Lastly, LPA Turner was notified by staff and clients in care that a client in care has made allegations in the past to try and get staff and clients in trouble. Clients advised LPA Turner that they do not get along with this client in care because they like cause arguments in the house. Staff advised LPA Turner that they are working with this client in care so they can resolve their behavioral issues.

Interviews were conducted with RP, C1, C2, C3, C4, S1, S2, S3, FSW and Gma on 03/02/2020, 03/05/2020, 3/12/2020 and 04/02/2020. LPA requested a police report from Sacramento Police Department on 3/12/2020. Interviews were consistent that the stolen vehicle belonged to S2 which was parked in front of the facility. The interviews were consistent with that the staff office was unlocked and C1 was able to steal S2\u2019s car keys; and that C1 was left in the backyard unsupervised providing C1 the opportunity to get into the office and steal the car keys. Clients, S1 and S2 shared that both staff were inside the house watching C1 from the window. Interviews show that it was another client and not the staff that noticed C1 in the staff\u2019s car starting the engine. The facility was aware about C1\u2019s history of stealing cars and did not ensure to lock the office door where the facility vehicle\u2019s and staff vehicles keys are located. When the LPA asked who is responsible to make sure the staff office is locked S2 responded that he does not know. On 03/17/2020 LPA got an email from FSW informing about court hearing for C1. The facility staff shared that C1 was charged with auto theft and had to go to the court. The charges for auto theft were dropped during this hearing. and C1 was sent back to reside in the facility. During the investigation of the allegation clients are threatening another client in care. LPA Sanders interviewed RP, C1, C2, C3, C4, S1, S2, S3, FSW and Gma. Interviews were consistent that clients in care are bullying C1. Interviews were consistent about C1 provoking the bullying by sneaking in other clients\u2019 rooms, touching their bodies and asking them to have sex with them. Clients were clear that they do not want C1 touching their bodies or their belongings. It was disclosed that other client\u2019s trash C1\u2019s room, break or steal his belongings and once one of them even urinated in his bedroom. The facility staff were consistent sharing that there are meeting with residents asking them to stop. Interviews show that counseling provided to C1 is not sufficient to meet client\u2019s needs. FSW shared that the facility gave C1 a 14-day notice to which the County denied due to the facility was aware about C1\u2019s background when they took them in. Interviews show that despite the risk C1 was putting himself and others by his behaviors the facility did not increase the supervision. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews conducted and record reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. The facility is cited on the attached LIC 9099D under the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter Number 1, Article 6 80078 (a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and 80072 and 80072(a) Personal Rights Exit interview conducted with Laynee Kuhn, a copy of this report, Lic 811 dated 3/2/20, a copy of the appeal rights were emailed to the facility with a return receipt requested.",

On July 30, 2020, the Department concluded a complaint investigation for the facility; Paradise Oaks Youth Services - Linda Creek. The complaint alleged C1 died while in care. The investigation revealed that C1 had a history of sexual assault and was facing charges for a sexual assault. C1 was inadequately supervised giving him the opportunity to sexually assault other residents, including C2. C1 needed a higher level of supervision than provided at the facility and therefore the facility should have acted to provide a higher level of supervision. The allegations were substantiated, and the licensee was cited for violating California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, Regulations 87072 (d) Personal Rights and 87065.5(g) Direct Care Staff Ratio. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the Department has determined that an Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted for the violation of Personal Rights ILS Section 87072 (d) of C2. The penal code section 243 defines serious bodily injury as \"a serious impairment of physical condition. This section describes willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health and Safety (H&S) Code section 1548 (f)(1)(c), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2500.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights were discussed and provided to Administrator.",

    "narrative": "Investigation shows that on the morning of 4/10/2020, the date of the incident in question, C1 (see LIC811 dated DATE) got out of bed early in the morning and went into C2's bedroom but was observed by S1. S1 asked C1 to leave C2's bedroom but when C1 refused to leave, S1 woke C2 and informed C2 that C1 was in the room and to remove themselves from the room. C2 allegedly went after C1 and a fight ensued between the youth. S1 was able to separate the youth and then went to call for assistance. While calling for assistance, C1 left the facility and was seen in front of the facility. S1 ordered C1 to return to the facility but C1 refused to come in and instead walked into traffic and was struck by a passing vehicle, and died. On 4/10/2020, the facility was within the required staffing ratio of one staff to six clients. Staff was supervising C1 at the time of the incident. Staff instructed C1 to come back into the facility, which C1 refused. Staff then called for back-up assistance. Although C1 did need additional supervision at times, due to C1's challenging behaviors, there is no documentation in C1's Child and Family Team meetings to warrant additional staff was needed at all times or at the time of C1's death; C1's behaviors were normal for C1 and non-injurious to staff or other youth in the facility. While it is unfortunate that C1 died while in the care of the facility, there was no regulatory violation noted at the time of the incident. As a result of the investigation, the allegation \"Minor died while in care\" is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Kuhn and report was provided via email.",

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed the following: FY1 (see LIC811 dated 11/6/2020) went into FY2's room in the early morning hours of 4/3/2020 and touched FY2 inappropriately. During this incident, it was documented that S-6 was present and attempted to redirect FY1 out of FY2's room. Law enforcement was contacted due to FY2 alleging to staff that FY1 touched him in the genital area. However, during interviews with law enforcement and Licensing, and in analysis of the incident reports, S-6 made conflicting statements. S-6 told law enforcement they saw FY1 go in and out of FY2's room \"throughout the night\" and when FY1 went into FY2's room in the early morning hours, they couldn't tell for sure, but it appeared that FY1 was not wearing clothes and had a pair of shorts draped around their neck. S-6 wrote an incident report stating that FY1 went into FY2's room and S-6 was behind FY1. S-6 told Licensing staff FY1 would sleep through the night and regularly wake in the early morning hours. An incident report written by S-6 states that they were behind FY1 when they entered FY2's bedroom and FY1 dropped the basketball shorts once in the room. FY2 told law enforcement that FY1 had been harassing FY2 for the past two months. FY2 said that this was the first incident where FY1 had touched FY2 on the genitals directly. Incident reports written indicate that FY1 went into FY2's room and began pulling on FY2's shorts while touching FY2 but there is nothing about touching of the genitals or even touching FY2 inappropriately. Based on investigation including observations made, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that staff did not provide adequate supervision resulting in inappropriate behavior between clients is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

FY was beaten up after school on 2-25-20 and was taken to an urgent clinic that same evening by a Paradise Oaks staff (FE). FE was informed by medical personnel that the clinic did have the appropriate equipment to take an x-ray and suggested FY be taken to the hospital emergency room for an x-ray. According to FE, FY kept changing his mind about going to the emergency room. FE took FY to a fast food restaurant and it appeared that FY was eating without any difficulty. The FE called the FA and was told they could wait until the next morning to take FY to the emergency room.",

It was alleged that staff engaged in a verbal altercation with FY. According to the intake social worker FY had thrown grapes at a staff because the staff would not give the phone to FY. The intake social worker observed the staff person get close to FY\u2019s face and at first thought the two were joking around until the intake social worker saw the look on the staff person\u2019s face. The intake social worker told the staff to step outside and take a breath. According to FY the staff did get in his face. The staff person did admit to being angry and stated he did get into FY\u2019s face and told FY he wanted to hit him. According to documentation the incident took place on 3-3-20 and the staff person resigned on 3-4-20.

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed the following: It is alleged that the facility is not implementing activities. Communication Logs for May-July 2020 indicate the following outings were planned: Banister park, Denios, Hidden Trails, Folsom Lake, Hiding Falls, Bradshaw animal shelter, Boat outing, and Antelope Creek. The communication logs list the following in-house theme nights and activities: water balloon throw, connect 4 board game, ice cream outing, card games, puzzles, movies, BBQ challenge, arts and crafts, color wars, baseball with Mariposa house, and baking. The facility has no record of which client(s) participated in activities or went on outings. Records do not indicate if the planned activity or outing occurred or did not occur. There were inconsistent statements for the use of the internet in the house. Four foster youth stated the house had internet or limited internet. Two foster youth stated the house did not have internet access. According to two staff, youth have internet access for distance learning, homework, and earned free time. It is alleged that the disciplinary system restricts activities. The facility utilizes a progressive point system designed to motivate youth to advance through a behavioral modification program. According to the facility Program Statement, the program is structured to encourage and reward positive behaviors and decrease negative behaviors. Staff stated that if a client is on a level drop due to misconduct, they lose privileges for four days. If a client re-offends prior to the four-day loss of privilege, then the time starts over again. The youth are confined to the facility and typically do not participate in planned outings when they are on loss of privilege. Seven youth stated if they were off level, they could still go to the park, go to the gym, and play basketball. Five of seven youth stated they could not go on planned outings if they were off level. The five youths stated they never went anywhere because they were never on level. Staff reported the Administrators and Social Workers have the ability to modify restrictions to incentivize youth to participate in activities. Based on the evidence, the allegations that the facility is not implementing activities and that the disciplinary system restricts activities are UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning that although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted with Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director. A copy of the reports and appeal rights were provided to the facility via email.",

    "narrative": "It is alleged that the stabilization process after behavioral episodes is not meeting the needs of the youth. Staff interviews state procedures are in place during a crisis and immediately following a behavioral episode to include de-escalating youth, calming communications, encouraging use of individual coping skills, active listening, and staying in proximity until the client is at baseline. Documentation discusses increased anxiety of FY1, placed in the program for the second time on 4/21/20, but no specific intervention or specialty mental health services were documented for anxiety. FY1 was identified with anger issues and unsafe impulsive behaviors. The objective on the Needs and Services Plan for the youth is to remain safe, refrain from substance use, aggression, AWOL, and other unsafe behaviors 100% of the time in May 2020. This goal was met 28% of the time in April and 31% of the time in May. However, the goal for June remained at 100% of the time. Although documentation identifies a need for stabilization, the facility lacks evidence that behavioral episodes result in a modification to the Needs and Services Plan (NSP) or interventions to assist youth to stabilize. It is alleged that the Needs and Services Plans and Treatment Plans are inadequate or ineffective. NSP monthly updates have unrealistic goals. Example: FY1 met Focus Area One, 31 % of the time in May. Youth\u2019s goal for June is to meet the goal 100% of the time. Interventions listed on the NSP are not individualized and are not updated. A template of interventions are listed monthly. The NSP monthly updates do not specify a method of evaluating progress in the specific Focus Area. Example: Focus Area 2 states FY1 struggles with anger management. The objective is that youth will utilize appropriate coping skills, such as deep breathing, or taking time away, or have 1:1 with staff by the 3rd prompt, 70% of the time over the next 30 days. NSP does not specify individualized interventions to assist the youth with meeting the goals. A Treatment Plan lists a goal for FY1 to manage his feelings of anger appropriately. The objective is for the youth to manage his anger 90% of the time by a 3rd prompt from staff. The intervention plan lists the same methods and interventions for each goal in the Treatment Plan. It is alleged that the facility's services and supports are inadequate. NSP do not have attainable goals based on observed behaviors. Interventions and specialty services are not specified on documentation. Example: FY1 has a reading level many years behind his grade level and it is identified as a barrier in his treatment plan yet no documentation of this specific need in the NSP for April, May or June, nor any interventions noted. AWOL is listed on youth\u2019s NSP as an objective for youth to refrain from 100% of the time over the next 30 day. No intervention strategy of how youth is to obtain that objective. Youth met this goal 28% of the time in April and 31% in May. The goal for June remained at 100% of the time. It is identified in progress notes that FY4 has abandonment issues yet there is no documentation addressing this specific need.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. The facility is cited for violation of Title 22 Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 3, regulations 87078.2 Trauma-Informed Interventions and Treatment Practices, 87068.3 Modifications to the Needs & Services Plan, and 87089.1 Mental Health.

    "narrative": "On 06/18/21 at 1:30 PM, the second collaborative a quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learnin\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021. A copy of this report will be emailed for signatures to Laynee Kuhn.",

    "narrative": "On 09/17/21 at 1:00 PM, the third collaborative quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 27. Three locations: Madison, Sunset and Old Auburn currently have no foster youth placed. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Johnson, LPA, Tammy Hill, LPA \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director POYS reported a staff and family moved into Sunset after their home burned down approximately 2 weeks ago. Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled",

    "narrative": "On 06/18/21 at 1:30 PM, the second collaborative a quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learning was embraced by about half of the clientele, with the other half preferring in-person learning.\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021. A copy of this report will be emailed for signatures to Laynee Kuhn.",

POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 27. Three locations: Madison, Sunset and Old Auburn currently have no foster youth placed.

Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled",

LPA made the visit to discuss the following incident reports for this facility: 4/14/21 there are five reports related to property destruction in the facility and one resulted in a restraint after causing a hole in the wall as a result of opening a door too hard. LPA questioned what was happening at the facility and why this one particular incident resulted in a restraint of C1. Ms. Kuhn states that the staff that handled this incident has been out as a result of this restraint due to an injury sustained by the staff person. Ms. Kuhn is to provide a follow up statement from staff that would provide additional detail to this incident. . C2 also reportedly had females at the facility overnight and it was reported to the agency that the overnight staff knew that the females were there and did not do anything to deter this from happening. When speaking with Ms. Kuhn, the staff was immediately terminated as a result of this incident. LPA did obtain additional documentation related to staff person (S1). C2 was observed to be playing with fire/starting fires in the living room of the facility. Facility reports that there was not any reported damage to the facility and this incident was discussed in child and family team meeting but that the child is no longer in the facility. C3 had gone out on his own and gotten a job interview and when reporting this to the facility, C3 was informed that per the child and family team meeting, C3 was not authorized to have a job. LPA asked what the protocol of this is and Ms. Kuhn states that they discuss age and behavior appropriate readiness for employment and this youth was not cleared to have outside employment.\n\nC4 left the facility to go to the store after getting allowance and staff contacted to report youth as unauthorized to be out of the facility. LPA asked if youth was authorized community time and if law enforcement was contacted due to youth not signing out of the facility. LPA was informed that they contact law enforcement immediately if they do not have authorized community time per the discussion in the child and family team meetings. C5 left the facility to go to a store and there is mention about juvenile hall on the report. LPA inquired as to why a youth leaving to go to a store would justify contact with juvenile hall. LPA was informed that when the missing persons report was filed per the agency protocol, they were informed of an outstanding warrant record however this issue had already been cleared up in court prior to youth coming into placement. LPA discussed with Ms. Kuhn the additional clarification needed on the reports to ensure all details including antecedents and follow up are captured appropriately. No citations were issued as a result of this inspection. Document provided to Ms. Kuhn.",

Another allegation is whether S1 had an inappropriate relationship with C1 or C2 resulting unprofessional conduct. C1 admits to more than ten inappropriate incidents with S1. While many of the incidents were identified as occurring after S1 resigned, the investigation was unable to determine if the below incidents occurred before or after S1 resigned.\n\nThose incidents include: C1 reported S1 provided him with marijuana 12-13 times, S1 called C1 extremely late on his cell phone multiple times, S1 took C1 to S1\u2019s personal residence four times and spent the night twice. S1 encouraged C1 to AWOL and provided transportation. S1 rented a hotel room for C1. The most egregious incidents occurred when S1 obtained and provided C1 the address of a person that assaulted him. S1 showed C1 a \u201cGlock\u201d handgun and allowed C1 to hold it while at S1\u2019s residence. Then S1 told C1 to \u201ctake care of him\u201d. In addition, S1 told C1, her ex-fianc\u00e9 was abusive and suggested C1 \u201cshoot him up\u201d.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA David Torres observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Javon Metoyer, Administrator.",

    "narrative": "On 06/18/21 at 1:30 PM, the second collaborative a quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learning was embraced by about half of the clientele, with the other half preferring in-person learning.\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021. A copy of this report will be emailed for signatures to Laynee Kuhn.",

    "narrative": "One staff (S1) stated that she is Pro-Act trained but new employees do not get the hands-on role playing because Covid has forced the training online. Staff stated with the assaultive behaviors of their youth, there is not enough staff if there are multiple crises but staff are trained. Staff acknowledge Covid has created employee shortages and lack of in-person training. C3 stated that staff do not do enough when clients are escalated, but there is not much staff can do. C1 stated staff try to get us to disengage with each other and calm us down and go for walks or go outside. C1 stated if there were more staff, there would be more support for everybody. It is alleged that the needs of a child are not being met. CSW stated that C1 is getting TBS from the facility clinicians. Therapeutic behavioral services are an intensive, individualized, one-to-one behavioral mental health service for youth with serious emotional challenges. CSW stated the facility typically had a lot of resources but Covid has made it difficult everywhere. The facility social worker (SW) stated the number one issue is keeping C1 safe from self-harming tendencies. SW is working closely with house staff so interactions with the youth are consistent with her treatment plan. S1 stated youth participates in all her therapies but has a high need for recognition and seeks attention, so it is difficult to answer if youth is getting her needs met. C1 stated she would like more support when she is upset. C1 stated she has a treatment plan and participates in therapy sessions but she feels more one-on-one time would help. C1 used to go on drives with her social worker but that ended with the Covid restrictions. Based on the interviews conducted the allegations, that staff are not adequately trained to intervene during incidents and the treatment needs of a child are not being met, are UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegations may or may not have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, appeal rights and the LIC811 were discussed and left with Amanda Lee.",

LPA interviewed three foster youth (C1, C2, C3, see confidential names on LIC811) on 3/24/21, the facility social worker (SW) on 6/14/21, one staff (S1) and the county social worker (CSW) on 6/15/21, and one staff (S2) on 4/8/21. LPA conducted a file review and obtained the following documents: Pro-Act training certificates, staff contacts, maintenance repair logs, four needs and services plans and treatment plans, behavioral plans, and a register of current clients. It is alleged that staff are not adequately trained to intervene during incidents. Staff attend Professional Assault Crisis Training (Pro-Act) for de-escalation and restraint training. The first sixteen hours of Pro-Act training is on hands-off de-escalation techniques. Staff are then trained to use hands-on restraints as a last course of action. If a restraint becomes necessary, two restraint-trained staff must be present to conduct the restraint.",

    "narrative": "C3 confirmed she smokes cigarettes but learned she may be pregnant and will stop smoking. C3 and three staff confirm that when youth leaves the facility, staff follow her. If staff loses sight they immediately call law enforcement to report a runaway. C2 confirmed she sometimes smokes marijuana when she goes on unauthorized leave but not at the facility because staff get in her face. S1 stated C2 uses substances infrequently. All clients are offered alcohol and substance use classes if they are using substances or they indicate they may be interested in attending. If clients are using substances staff discuss the dangers, coax clients to give substance to staff, have clients conduct a self-search if they show signs of intoxication or use, and encourage substance use treatment. It is alleged that a minor in care is not adequately provided with care and supervision. C1 fears that C3 is too aggressive and impulsive to live there and that regular staff are doing their best but if C3 returns to the facility she will be a threat to herself, other clients, and staff. C1 stated that C3 needs a higher level of care. According to S1, C3 will not be returning to the facility. A higher level of care is being sought for the youth. Based on information obtained from the interviews C1\u2019s concerns were based on fear that C3 may come back to the facility. Staff follow runaway protocol and contact law enforcement if they lose sight of a youth. Substance use treatment is offered to clients and searches are conducted if contraband is suspected. The inappropriate interactions between minors in care occurred during an unauthorized absence. Staff were not present but had notified law enforcement of youth\u2019s absence. It was determined that C3 requires a higher level of care and will not return to the facility. Although the incidents have occurred, staff followed standard procedures, therefore the allegations that inappropriate interactions between minors in care, staff did not prevent minors from smoking marijuana, minor in care not adequately provided with care and supervision, and lack of supervision resulting in minor going AWOL are UNSUBSTANTIATED. There is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report left at the facility.",

The investigation revealed that a foster youth (C1) was concerned about the imminent return of another youth (3) when released from juvenile detention. C1 is concerned for the safety of clients and staff if C3 comes back to the facility. C3 has a history of assaultive and destructive behaviors and was detained due to an assault on staff. It is alleged that there were inappropriate interactions between minors in care, staff did not prevent minors from smoking marijuana and lack of supervision resulted in minor going AWOL. C3 confirmed that while on an unauthorized leave she engaged in sexual activity with a youth from another facility.",

    "narrative": "On 09/17/21 at 1:00 PM, the third collaborative quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 27. Three locations: Madison, Sunset and Old Auburn currently have no foster youth placed. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Johnson, LPA, Tammy Hill, LPA \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director POYS reported a staff and family moved into Sunset after their home burned down approximately 2 weeks ago. Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled.",

    "narrative": "In LPA's review of the facility's Program Statement, there was no mention of confiscating clients' belongings as a consequence and storing them locked in the garage for 24 hours. The Department has not approved this method. The facility's Program Statement states the facility uses positive discipline, trauma-informed practices, and that, \"staff are trained not to be punitive with the youth.\" The facility is not following their Program Statement, nor CCL Personal Rights regulations, by confiscating clients' clothes and other personal belongings as a consequence. This practice is also not trauma-informed. Based on LPA's interviews which were conducted and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 4, Section 87072(c)(11) is being cited on the attached LIC 9099D. An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was emailed to FM with a read receipt which will serve as the record of receipt.\n\nLPA learned from confidential interviews that C1 would often try to push their way into the staff office and need to be prevented from entering by way of body blocking, removing them from the door, or by shutting the door before C1 could enter. LPA reviewed four incident reports detailing incidents like that. LPA was informed in one confidential interview that when C1 had barricaded themselves in their room, S1 tried to push open the door. It became a pushing back and forth situation between them and one individual states that staff pushed the door on the client, and another individual denied it. All other non-involved individuals interviewed either stated they have never seen S1 do that to a client, or that they did not have knowledge of the incident. All staff and all but one client interviewed denied that staff have threatened a client before, other than phrasing for giving consequences. An example of this could be something to the effect of: \"if you don't do X, you'll have a point taken away.\" One client claimed that S1 threatened violence on them. S1 denies ever threatening any client. Based on all evidence collected through interviews and incident reports, LPA has found that C1 and S1 at times have a tumultuous relationship, there are inconsistent statements from clients and staff, and it is uncertain whether or not the allegations occurred. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED. An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was emailed to FM with a read receipt which will serve as the record of receipt.",

C2 denied pressuring C1, claiming that C1 initiated requests to vape, and that staff provided support for her coping skills. Staff generally reported that while C1 and C2 had a complicated dynamic, there was no clear evidence of C2 pressuring C1. Staff supervision is in ratio and if C1 has AWOL they do follow their emergency intervention.

LPA Martinez met with Naeem Brown (Assistant Administrator) and explained the purpose of the visit. The purpose of the visit today is to discuss the following deficiency: reporting requirements. During record reviews, it was learned that the facility has not reported incidents to the Department as required. The unreported incidents that occurred directly threatened the physical, emotional health, and safety of the clients in care. Documentation shows child 1 (C1) had seven incidents pertaining to aggression towards staff and youth. There were two incidents of verbal aggression towards staff and youth. Three inappropriate sexual behavior incidents towards staff. On February 07, 2025, an event occurred that was not reported to the Department. Staff 1 (S1) and child 1 (C1) were in a physical altercation. Upon the occurrence, the facility staff did not implement a safety plan that would entail de-escalation of physical aggression and the separation of S1 and C1. A February 07, 2025, facility notes, indicated this incident would not be addressed until February 13, 2025, CFT meeting. The lack of addressing the February 07, 2025, altercation in a timely manner resulted in a second physical altercation between S1 and C1 on February 09, 2025. Continued...\n\nBased on records review there were physical aggression commonalities between the unreported incidents and the physical altercations on February 07, 2025. However, the identified behavioral patterns were not addressed after the February 07, 2025, altercation. As a result, the Agency will be cited, and the 80061(b) reporting requirement deficiency can be found on the 809-D page. LPA Martinez will also return at a later date and time to follow up on the following: Open bedroom door policy, bedtime hours, and access to bedrooms. An exit interview was conducted with Naeem Brown (Assistant Administrator). A copy of this 809 report, 809D page, and appeals rights were given to the facility at the end of this visit.",

Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Martinez observed documentation of completed training and policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learning wa\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021.",

CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Dung Mac conducted a case management inspection on April 5, 2023 at 10:30 AM based on the number of relevant law enforcement contacts reported by the facility, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1538.7. During this inspection, 6 out of 6 Direct Care Staff and 4 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 6 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 4 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, April 5, 2023). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were emailed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments and Daily Communication Log, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Mac observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Amanda Lee.",

    "narrative": "Page 2. The records of 4/10/23 stated that FC1 refused this appointment and stated they want a new dentist. On the issue of court appointments, S2 stated that the facility has an agreement with the county that the county will pick FC1 up for court days as the facility does not participate in scheduling the hearings and are not made aware when those appointments are scheduled. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Allegation #3. Staff are not picking up minor in a timely manner. During the interview, FC1 stated that staff does not pick them from school in a timely manner. FC1 stated they have had to wait more than 2 hours before being picked up on one occasion and 30 minutes or so on some other occasions. When staff was interviewed, S1 stated that staff was late to pick FC1 up one time that she remembers, and this incident was addressed in another complaint. When FC3 was interviewed at school, FC3 stated that they have not experienced staff picking them up late from school. When S6 was interviewed on 7/20/23, S6 stated that he picks up the child that gets off from school by 2:45 pm and that the staff that resumes work at 2:00 pm picks up the youth that gets out of school by 2:50 pm. S6 stated that there was never a conflict in picking up the kids that he remembers because FC1 rarely goes to school and when FC1 attends school, FC1 calls the facility randomly and other times in the morning hours to pick FC1 from school. S6 said when this happens, he is the one that picks FC1 up from school. During the second interview of FC1 on 5/25/23, FC1 stated that staff does not pick them up on time and because of this reason they do not attend school regularly. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Cont. 3.\n\nPage 3. Allegation # 4. Staff are making inappropriate comments towards minors. On 4/28/23, FC1 stated that there was an incident on 4/20/23 where S5 was inciting FC2. FC2 corroborated this this and stated that on 4/20/23, S5 was inciting them to become violent by telling FC2 to \u201crun up or shut up.\u201d When S5 was interviewed on 5/10/23, S5 denied making the comment and stated that FC2 had shown her a tattoo gang carving on FC2\u2019s skin. S5 expressed the belief that FC2 was trying to intimidate her by the tattoo. S5 stated that during that incident, FC2 called their grandmother to report S5 and Staff could hear the grandmother uphold FC2\u2019s action. S5 stated she could hear grandma of FC2 telling FC2 to \"show the Sacramento bitch what the 209 is all about.\u201d Facility Manager submitted an incident report to LPA about this incident. The report revealed the youths were aggressive towards staff without provocation. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Allegation #7. Staff don't provide minors with privacy. When staff was interviewed regarding this allegation on 4/26/23 and 5/11/23, all staff stated that they provide the minors with adequate privacy, however whenever two minors that are not located together in the same room are seen together, the facility policy provides that staff should be close by to monitor and prevent them from fighting which happens very often when the clients stay close to each other. When FC2 was interviewed on 4/26/23, the youth stated that they, referring to the youths, are aware that when two youths who are not placed together in one room come together, a staff is required to be close by and this is because they fight when they come together, and staff is trying to prevent them from fighting. FC1 also stated they understand they could have gone outside to make the call, but they did not wish to take the call outside. Cont on 4.\n\nPage 4. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Allegation #10. Facility is dirty. During the youths\u2019 interviews on 4/26/23 both FC1 and FC2 stated that the facility was left dirty for about 2 days. During the interview of the facility manager, S1 on 4/26/23, S1 stated that the youths fought in the living room and spilled ketchup all over the floor. LPA observed the carpet has been cleaned but there was still stain on the carpet from that incident. A picture of the evidence was obtained. S1 stated that due to the amount of spill, a work order was placed for the carpet to be deep cleaned. On 4/28/23 the carpet cleaned company cleaned the carpet, but the stain could not be completely removed. On 7/13/23, LPA visited the facility, and the Facility Manager informed the LPA that a work order has been issued to change the carpet and the company had come out to take measurements. LPA observed the stain on the carpet floor, and litters all over the office floor. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

During the interview of FC1 on 4/26, FC1 stated that staff does not regularly provide transportation to their dental and court appointments and that staff does not inform them in a timely manner about their appointments. FC1 said because they do not get this information on time, they are not able to prepare for their appointments. When FC2 was interviewed, FC2 stated that they have not been declined transportation to their appointments, but that staff has failed to take FC1 to some of their court appointments. When FC3 was interviewed on 5/9/23, FC3 stated they have not experienced staff not taking FC3 to their appointments. During the interview with FC1\u2019s case manager, the Case Manager stated that FC1 is the one refusing to attend their dental appointments. S2 provided CFT notes to corroborate this statement. The note showed that FC1 attended the checkup scheduled on 3/20/23 where the doctor referred them for orthodontist and fillings visit. The notes on 4/3/23 stated that FC1 refused to come out of their room or attend this appointment and it was rescheduled on 4/10/23. Cont 2.",

Another passenger on the bus said that FC1 should not be allowed on the bus.

Additionally, statements made were inconsistent regarding the period of time the alleged staff member had worked at the specified facility, transported the youth, or had been in the presence of the youth for the allegations to have occurred. The staff, S1, resigned from their employment on 02/03/2024.

    "narrative": "On 06/18/21 at 1:30 PM, the second collaborative a quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. The first meeting was held on March 19, 2020. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 28. Two locations have closed, Linda Creek on 2/3/21 and Violets on 5/11/21. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst. \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director, Thomas Harrer, Clinical Director POYS provided a status update of the CARF evaluation stating the accreditation approval is over two months out due to backlogs from covid. An extension of approval is in effect. The Mental Health review by Dept. of Health Care Service (DHCS) was completed in April 2021 and at this time POYS is working with DHCS in providing the plan of corrections. POYS reports numerous clients recently graduated from high school. Some graduates are enrolled in community college, some are working, some are seeking transitional housing programs, and some are still figuring things out. Distance learning challenges were reported to be with band-width issues both from the schools and at the facilities. Distance learning was embraced by about half of the clientele, with the other half preferring in-person learning.\n\nCCL reported a decrease in complaints and incident reports. POYS attribute the decline to a more deliberate intake process and screening for better compatibility with the current clients. They also reported they were revamping their level system. In addition, POYS is training house staff to participate more closely with each client and their overall treatment plan. Staff are eliciting more input from youth on what is working/not working with the program. Youth have responded with more engagement. POYS reported they are resuming a higher level of training for staff as more in-person training become available. They have contracted with Relias Learning for staff training. When asked about the status of overnight staff, POYS reported, they have two roamers that are assigned to three homes each. They also have one floater that helps out as needed or if someone calls out. This model is used both for the day shift and nighttime shift. The roamers and floaters meet regularly with staff to discuss client behaviors and needs. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. They complimented the discussed areas of change and the graduation of youth. DHCS discussed the pros/cons of the virtual Mental Health review and was appreciative for POYS\u2019 feedback on the process. Clarification on mask wearing requirements for POYS clients and staff will be provided as the Department receives details. POYS will submit an electronic Program Statement to include recent revisions. They next meeting is scheduled for September 17, 2021.",

    "narrative": "On 09/17/21 at 1:00 PM, the third collaborative quarterly meeting with Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) was held to provide technical assistance and collaborative support to assist with and ensure POYS operates a successful program. POYS consists of nine locations: Olivine, Rosa Vista, Hazel, Hickory, Antelope, Mariposa, Old Auburn, Madison, and Sunset. The current census at all locations is 27. Three locations: Madison, Sunset and Old Auburn currently have no foster youth placed. The following were present on an MS Teams virtual meeting: \u00b7 CCL: Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Robin Sullivan, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Johnson, LPA, Tammy Hill, LPA \u00b7 System of Care (SOC): Marjana Jackson, Stacie Kinney. \u00b7 Sacramento County: Linda Abdelbaki \u00b7 Department Health Care Services (DHCS): Brian Keefer \u00b7 POYS: Robert Pye, CEO, Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director, Stephanie Fisher, Program Director POYS reported a staff and family moved into Sunset after their home burned down approximately 2 weeks ago. Annual inspections were completed for all their facilities in June and July, resulting in Technical Advisory/Advisory Notes and no deficiencies cited. CCL will provide the electronic program statement revisions to System of Care. Program statement revisions for the SAY population was submitted but still needs to be reviewed and approved. LPA Marla Horne will review by October 20, 2021.\n\nIncident reports regarding smoking on grounds was discussed. Both trauma-informed practices and harm reduction protocols were discussed. Harm reduction practices have not been approved by the Department. POYS is reminded that incident reports should document interventions including staff discouraging youth from smoking. CCL pointed out youth smoking in the backyard is still smoking on grounds which may require additional case management inspections. CCL requested program statement revision to Transportation services to add details of exceptions to provide transportation to youth when extreme weather, youth not feeling well or after hours. CCL requested incident reports be typed due to the difficulty of reading the handwritten reports. At this time there are multiple POYS staff that still hand write reports. This has been an ongoing conversation between POYS and CCL. CCL requests all reports be typed by November 1, 2021. POYS declined this request. CCL requested all youths\u2019 names be included in one incident report rather than referring to other involved youth as \u201cpeer\u201d. CCL recommended using a legend to submit the report to CCL and redacting the names for POYS purposes. POYS declined the request due to confidentiality. The CCL request was requested and approved through upper management and noted not to be a HIPPA violation. CCL requested incident reports and timeframes be more specific. Antecedent information is specific and thorough, yet more follow up details or resolution information is needed and requested. CCL recommended POYS to Technical Support Program (TSP) for incident report writing. POYS approved the recommendation. Sacramento County had no specific areas of concern. DHCS had no specific areas of concern. Due to the upcoming impact of FFPSA on program statements, a deadline for the revisions was not determined and will be included at the time of the FFPSA changes. No further meetings are scheduled.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Alyssa Burgess and Shawndra Miles made an unannounced annual inspection at the facility and met with a Paradise Oaks Youth Services (POYS) Administrator, Jovan Metoyer, who assisted with this inspection. After the walk-through, LPAs continued their inspection at the POYS Administration Office where we met with Stephanie Fisher, Program Director and Laynee Kuhn, Executive Director. LPAs conducted a walk-through of the facility inside and out. There were no clients present during the inspection as the facility has not been in use since 2020. There are three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a staff office, living room, den, kitchen and garage. LPA inspected and/or reviewed the following: Posting of license and Children\u2019s Personal Rights checked; Disinfectants/Cleaning solutions were found to be kept in the kitchen area of the facility. The refrigerator's temperature was read at 40 degrees Fahrenheit; the freezer temperature was at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. There was not an adequate supply of perishable and non-perishable foods as required. The only food present was purchased by the Administrator for the Administrator's personal use. There is a working landline telephone at the facility. All carbon monoxide and smoke detectors were checked with the assistance of the POYS Administrator. There was one carbon monoxide detector installed in the hallway outside of the clients\u2019 bedrooms, which was non-functional. The smoke detectors throughout the facility were working as required. There was no first aid kit at the facility. This was previously addressed with the facility on 6/30/2021, at which time they received an advisory note. An adequately sized common room was available. The dining area had enough space to accommodate clients. LPAs observed holes in the walls of the dining area and in the hallway leading to the garage. There were no medications on-site. An expired fire extinguisher was observed in the kitchen and the meter indicated it needed to be recharged. The refrigerators and freezers were not cleaned and had expired food from 2020 to Feb 2022. This was previously addressed with the facility on 6/30/2021, at which time they received an advisory note.\n\nSinks, baths, and shower fixtures were all in good repair. The toilets were not cleaned and the water had evaporated due to limited use. Provisions of soap, paper towels, and other personal hygiene were observed in the master bathroom only. The laundry area was clean; required linen and furnishings were found to be present and in working order in the linen closets. There were no facility service vehicles on-site. There was no indication of the facility campus having any pest infestation. The facility was unclean and in disrepair in several parts: surfaces, doors, walls, and carpets were dirty with smears, crumbs, etc. there were holes in the wall in the bathroom near the garage/kitchen, broken moulding and no door on the hallway closet, a missing light bulb in one bathroom, garbage on counter in kitchen, dirty dishes in sink, general clutter and debris throughout whole house. Administrator's bedroom messy, piles of dirty linens/towels in the garage. Staff office had a foul odor. The facility has a Disaster and Mass Casualty plan that is up-to-date and readily available. LPAs instructed the facility to amend the plan to indicate how refrigerated medication will be stored. Currently, the facility is not conducting drills, as there are no clients. LPA's observed an POYS Administrator residing at the facility. During the course of the inspection the Administrator admitted to having a firearm with a loaded magazine and ammunition improperly stored on the premises. The firearm was in a locked box, which the Administrator unlocked for LPAs to show an unloaded firearm, with two magazines next to it, one of which was loaded. The Administrator also had two boxes of additional ammunition, which was kept unlocked, in a bag. LPA let Administrator know those cannot be stored in that manner, and how to store them properly. Administrator removed the ammunition from the magazine and took all ammunition to his car to be secured. Additionally, there was curved knife that was in the Administrator's bedroom, which he stated was confiscated from a client. The Administrator's room smelled of marijuana, showed presence of marijuana, and smoking paraphrenia, to which the Administrator admitted to owning. There were various other things missing or incorrect, which LPA detailed in the attached Technical Violation Advisory Notes, which are not citations: 80076(a)(17,19-20), 80088(e)(3), Interim Licensing Standards 87076(c)(4), Health & Safety Code 1565(a)(7)(e).

This inspection was conducted via Microsoft Teams due to COVID19 restrictions on conducting on site inspections at licensed facilities. LPA Segura sent the Administrator Steve Duran a Document Request checklist on 08/28/2020. LPA Segura received requested documents on 09/04/2020. The facility has four clients in placement at this time, two are taking psychotropic medications. On 09/10/2020 student assistant Tania Martinez reviewed Assessment Needs and Services Plan, Centrally Stored Medication logs, and medication authorization documents. On this date student assistant also reviewed the facility program statement and medication policies and procedures and input to file review checklist. LPA Segura conducted a phone interview with C1 (Client 1, see confidential names list LIC 811 dated 09/18/2020) on 09/15/2020 and interview with C2 on 09/17/2020. C3 declined to be interviewed for the purposes of this inspection. During todays inspection LPA Segura conducted two staff interviews regarding psychotropic medications. LPA requested staff Monze Duenas to do a pill count for C2 and C3 (Client 2, 3, see LIC 811 confidential name list dated 09/18/2020) at approximately 12:15pm. LPA Segura calculated the pills that should be left by reviewing the centrally stored log and medication administration log submitted. There were no irregularities found during the pill count. Note a pill count of C1 was not conducted as they were discharged and moved on 09/17/2020.\n\nIn the course of condcuting the pill count. Staff Monze mentioned that the facility had an \"overflow\" for medication. LPA inquired and she stated that they put medication there if for example there are more pills left over due to medication refusal by the client and a new prescription bottle is obtained. LPA further explored the \"overflow\" medication container with the Administrator Steve Duran who indicated they actually use that box for storing medication to be destroyed and should not be used for storage of any medication. The administrator stated he would rectify the issue and rename the other medication box for medication to be destroyed to make it clear that is the only use of the box. During the inspection there were only eye drops in the box, no other medication was observed being stored. There were not deficiencies noted at today's evaluation. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was emailed to the Administrator Steve Duran. A read receipt was requested to acknowledge that the report was received.",

    "narrative": "Interviews with youth C2 and C3 on 12/04/21 beginning at 2pm, revealed that S1 (Staff 1, see confidential name list 811 dated 01/27/21) yelled at clients over the use of marijuana at the facility. Further interview with C1 on 12/08/2021 revealed that S1 followed C1 to their bedroom when they were attempting to evade S1. While C1 was attempting to close their bedroom door, S1 pushed the door open while C1 was attempting to close the door. C1 then attempted to evade S1 into the bathroom and S1 put their foot in the door and stopped the door from shutting. C1 stated that S1 then pushed their way into the bathroom allowing the door to shut behind them and pushed C1 back further into the bathroom to gain entry. C1 stated that S1 did yell and use profanity while accusing C1 of using marijuana at the facility and scheduling a Child Family Team meeting. Interviews conducted with S1 on 12/03/21 confirmed that S1 did raise voice at clients, but denied pushing C1. S1 admitted to entering both the bedroom and bathroom as client was attempting to evade them. S1 stated that they were trying to explain to C1 they were not getting kicked out of the program. Confidential interview conducted with a staff on 12/17/2021 at 4pm revealed that they did hear S1 yelling at C1 upstairs and using profanity. Staff indicated that they did not see or hear S1 either push C1 or push their way into bathroom or bedroom. Only 1 staff out of three present that day confirmed they heard S1 using profanity toward C1; however all staff confirmed that S1 yelled at C1, C2 and C3 over the use of marijuana at the facility. In the course of interviewing staff and other clients in the home, it is confirmed that no one else was present upstairs with S1 and C1 to witness any pushing or entering of rooms forcefully. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that S1 yelled at C1, C2 and C3. There is also a preponderance of the evidence to prove that S1 pushed C1 therefore handled client aggressively. Therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Executive Director and deficiencies were cited. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was emailed to George for a signature, an email read receipt was requested.\n\nThe clients hide from and evade staff either outside or in the bathrooms. Clients statements indicated that the staff are supervising them. Clients further stated that they know staff can only do so much and limit the places they can search such as their person. Although clients are using marijuana at the facility, the Department could not determine that it is as a result of the lack of supervision from staff. There is not a preponderance of the evidence to proof staff are not supervising children resulting in the usage of marijuana. Appeal rights were provided and discussed with the facility staff listed above. No deficiencies were cited. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was emailed to Ernest Howard, Kelly Quackenbush and George Lopez.",

During the inspection LPA Segura met with administrator Andrew Sandoval and Medical Assistant Heydy Hernandez. The facility was inspected inside and out. In placement at this time there are four youth; two of which are taking psychotropic medication LPA Segura began by reviewing the two files for the youth who are taking psychotropic medication at around 10am. During the review LPA Segura observed that neither of the two clients had Assessment Needs and Services Plans signed by the authorized representative. Note however, that one client has been in placement less than 30 days therefore the facility is not required to have that on the file yet. LPA Segura reviewed 2 children's records on site at the facility at 10am. LPA reviewed 3 personnel files on site at 12:00pm LPA Segura interviewed 3 staff on site at around 11am. LPA did not interview any client's during todays inspection. The two youth were asked to participate but refused. LPA explained the purpose of the inspection and the youth still refused to participate. Continued on 809c\n\nAt around 2pm LPA Segura and Medical Assistant Heydy Hernandez conducted a medication count for two clients. The medication count resulted in C1's (Client 1; Medication 3, see confidential names list LIC 811 dated 07/14/2021) M3 having one extra pill. A count of C2's medication also resulted in an extra pill for M4. The review of the centrally stored logs and PMARs revealed the following: The facility is not logging medication received from a prior placement (only filled by the facility) The facility is future dating medication start date (anticipated start date) not actual start date. This practice may not account for medication refusals. Staff are not indicating on the PMAR when medication is refused; only leaving space blank not noting required refusal information. Per Title 22 Regulations, deficiencies were cited during this inspection. Exit interview conducted, appeal rights discussed and a copy of the report was left at the facility.",

What appears to be the main control in the kitchen; has a faceplate that is no longer secure to the wall and falls down onto the counter. LPA Segura was able to use their state issued iphone to capture photos of the intercom. During todays inspection the facility repairman used a sensor to show that there were live wires in the wall of this intercom; although they were capped with plastic electrical caps. Further inspection of the home; LPA Segura observed there were multiple faceplates missing from electrical and phone outlets in the home. LPA was able to use their state issued iphone to capture pictures of the missing faceplates. Some of the faceplates appear to be missing in areas the facility has had to patch the walls due to residents damaging the walls and outlets. On todays date, 06/07/2021 LPA observed that the living room sliding door windows are in need of repairs. The part of the sliding doors that is are not meant to slide have been pushed away from the wall creating a half inch opening to the outside. Further one of the sliding doors has come off the rail creating a half inch opening to the outside. Both items have allowed cold air and insects to come into the home. Based on observation and photographic evidence obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility is in need of repair and deep cleaning.

S8 denied that there were times that there was not enough food. S8 stated that there is always sufficient food. Interview with S2 revealed that the facility staff do attempt to stick to the posted menu; however, clients sometimes want something different or want the meal sooner than posted. S2 indicated that in those cases staff have to choose a different meal to provide clients. S2 stated that if they are missing ingredients or were used up, the staff calls the office to request the items be brought to the home.

What appears to be the main control in the kitchen; has a faceplate that is no longer secure to the wall and falls down onto the counter. LPA Segura was able to use their state issued iphone to capture photos of the intercom. During todays inspection the facility repairman used a sensor to show that there were live wires in the wall of this intercom; although they were capped with plastic electrical caps. Further inspection of the home on 03/16/2021 and 06/07/2021, LPA Segura observed there were multiple faceplates missing from electrical and phone outlets in the home. LPA was able to use their state issued iphone to capture pictures of the missing faceplates. Some of the faceplates appear to be missing in areas the facility has had to patch the walls due to residents damaging the walls and outlets. On todays date, 06/07/2021 LPA observed that the living room sliding door windows are in need of repairs. The part of the sliding doors that is are not meant to slide have been pushed away from the wall creating a half inch opening to the outside. Further one of the sliding doors has come off the rail creating a half inch opening to the outside. Both items have allowed cold air and insects to come into the home. Based on observation and photographic evidence obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility is in need of repair and deep cleaning. Therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Andrew Sandoval and deficiencies were cited.

The interview with S7 revealed that the runaway training is not part of the Nonviolent Crisis Intervention (NCI) and Emergency Intervention Plan training. Eric stated that the NCI training only touches on runaways when a hold is necessary not prevention. Eric indicated that due to personal rights the facility mostly tries to talk children out of running away and only ever conduct a hold on a child if they are being a danger to themselves or others such as attempting to run into traffic. Interviews conducted with staff revealed that staff felt as if they could not do anything to prevent a child from running away; however, did admit that they attempt to talk children out of running away by following them when they attempt to walk away and conduct bed checks overnight to ensure they are still in bed. Staff also report calling non-emergency number for the Monterey Sheriff\u2019s office to report a missing child. A review of the facility Program Statement revealed that although the facility does have a Runaway Plan, there is no indication that facility staff are trained in the plan. LPA Segura reviewed at hire training list and new hire training checklists for five staff. None of the documents showed that the facility is training staff on the runaway plan. An interview conducted with S8 confirmed that although staff knows some of the steps of the runaway plan, they had not seen the plan before LPA showed them a copy on 09/17.

A new LIC 809 and LIC 811 have been created for correct facility number 275200693 located in the open FAS database. Licensing Program Analyst Michelle P. Kyane conducted a case management inspection on April 26, 2022 at 11:39 am based on the number of relevant law enforcement contacts reported by the facility, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1538.7. During this inspection, 8 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 4 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. 3 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 4 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, April 26, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Michelle P. Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Zeana Bey, Clinical Supervisor",

Note this report signed on 06/08/2021 due to LPA's battery dying during inspection at the facility. The SIR stated that Staff called law enforcement because there were 15 tablets missing when completing a medication count on 02/07/2021. LPA Segura conducted an interview with the facility manager on 02/10/2021 Nate Garner regarding the incident. LPA Segura obtained a copy of the police report on 05/20/2021. The police report review revealed that the officer was unable to determine who took the medication as there is multiple staff who have keys and access to the medication. Further the officer indicated that the medication boxes the facility was using at the time, allowed someone to pry the side up and stick their hand in to remove medication. The boxes used were tool utility boxes with a padlock in the middle. The facility since has installed a metal lockbox attached to the wall. The facility completed a staff training on 02/15/2021 and monitored youth for any signs they had taken medication. The interview with Nate revealed that there were room searches done after it was discovered that medication was missing. In addition LPA Segura 06/07/2021 inspected the old medication boxes and confirmed the police officers finding that it is possible to pry open the side and take out items inside. Continued on LIC 809C\n\nThe investigation consisted of interviews with staff and a review of a police report and in person inspection. Based on the interviews regarding the SIR, the facility did not ensure medication was secure; therefore, the facility is being cited. Appeal Rights were discussed and an exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was provided to Andrew Sandoval via email for a signature.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Joel Segura conducted an unannounced inspection at the facility and met with Interim Executive Director Shaniz Beza regarding an incident that occurred on 03/15/2021. The incident indicated that C1 (Client 1, see confidential names list LIC 811 dated 09/30/2021) engaged in property destruction and assault of S1 (Staff 1). LPA Segura investigated the incident and was informed C1 came out of her bedroom window into the courtyard and argued with C2. An interview was conducted with S1 on 04/07/21 at approximately 3pm. S1 stated there were no other staff in the immediate area when C1 began to hit S1. S1 indicated that he was attempting to block C1 from hitting him and eventually made it out to the living room where other staff were present and intervened. Staff S3 and S2 intervened and escorted the client to the couch. Interview with former staff S3 on 09/08/21 at 1:45 pm, revealed that C1 had sat down on the couch and appeared to have calmed down. S3 indicated that C1 stood up, still appearing to be calm and then suddenly ran into the kitchen where S1 was attempting to keep distance from C1. S3 indicated that all she witnessed was S1 attempting to deflect C1 from hitting him and pushed C1 away in a further attempt to stop the attack. S3 indicated that again her and S2 escorted the client outside to try and calm him down. Continued on 809C\n\nS1 reported attempting to put C1 in a child hold. Interviews were conducted with S2, S3 and S4. S3 reported that S1 restrained C1 in a bear hug, S3 described S1 attempted to hold C1 from the back. Interview with S4 did not report seeing S1 hold C1 from the back. LPA reviewed Crisis Prevention Institute photographs and it appears a Child Control Position is where a child is held from behind; however, it is not a hugging action. Rather the child is held by their arms crossed in front of them. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that there was an inappropriate hold of C1. LPA Segura concluded there will be no violation per Title 22 Regulations. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was provided to the facility.",

An interview was conducted with S2 on 08/20/21 at approximately 10:15am. The interview with S2 revealed that C1 was trying to punch and hit S1. S2 stated he did not see S1 hit, handle in a rough manner or hear S1 state anything inappropriate to C1. S2 indicated that C1 did have a negative opinion of S1. A review of the CPS report made regarding this incident did contain a statement from C1 indicated that S1 had hit C1 and had made inappropriate comments toward C1. C1 was taken into custody by juvenile hall and had run away various times since removal from the facility. A review of county welfare database indicates that as of 06/25/2021 C1 has been missing therefore no interview was conducted. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that C1 was hit, handled in a rough manner or inappropriate comments were made; therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On this date LPA used their state issued iPhone to take pictures of the grounds at the facility. Pictures consisted of the linoleum near resident bedrooms in need of mopping and sweeping, stained carpets, power outlets missing face plates, missing floor board, visible patches, a small section of the homes siding appeared to have been torn off, cabinets in need of wiping from hand grease, kitchen cabinets with stuck on food particles and spills, and patches that seem to have been damaged again. During the 03/24 inspection, LPA observed that the facility had installed new windows to replace the previously broken ones. Note that although patches are not visually pleasing, they are not an immediate health and safety risk to clients in care and are fixes to damaged walls. LPA Segura interviewed staff S4 on 04/07/21 at 4:15pm, S5 on 08/25/21 at 10:15am, S6 on 08/20/21 at 10am, S7 on 09/01 at 4:15pm, S8 and S2 on 09/17 at 11:00am. See confidential names list LIC 811 dated 09/21/21. LPA Segura obtained staff training records at the facility on 08/25/2021 at approximately 10am. Five staff training documents were reviewed for new hire training. LPA Segura observed that all five staff had evidence that they were trained in accordance with the facilities training plan including Non violent Crisis Intervention and Emergency Intervention Plan. Interviews conducted with S5, S7 and S8 revealed that they had been trained and participate in annual refresher courses. Trainer S7 stated that he conducts regular training to for staff specifically for the nonviolent crisis interventions, other trainings are conducted by the facility manager or self-paced online training by outside providers. The interview with S7 revealed that the runaway training is not part of the Nonviolent Crisis Intervention (NCI) and Emergency Intervention Plan training. S7 stated that the NCI training only touches on runaways when a hold is necessary not prevention. S7 indicated that due to personal rights the facility mostly tries to talk children out of running away and only ever conduct a hold on a child if they are being a danger to themselves or others such as attempting to run into traffic. Continued on 9099C\n\nInterviews conducted with staff revealed that staff felt as if they could not do anything to prevent a child from running away; however, did admit that they attempt to talk children out of running away by following them when they attempt to walk away and conduct bed checks overnight to ensure they are still in bed. Staff also report calling non-emergency number for the Monterey Sheriff\u2019s office to report a missing child. A review of the facility Program Statement revealed that although the facility does have a Runaway Plan, there is no indication that facility staff are trained in the plan. LPA Segura reviewed at hire training list and new hire training checklists for five staff. None of the documents showed that the facility is training staff on the runaway plan. An interview conducted with S8 confirmed that although staff knows some of the steps of the runaway plan, they had not seen the plan before LPA showed them a copy on 09/17. A brief review was conducted with administrator Andrew Sandoval of the facility training documents and confirmed that the Runaway Plan is not listed on any of the checklists or training materials. Based on observation and photographic evidence obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility was in need of repair and deep cleaning and staff were not trained in the agency Runaway Plan. Therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Andrew Sandoval and deficiencies were cited. During todays inspection LPA Segura was given a tour of the facility ground and observed all windows have been repaired, floors cleaned and swept, carpets cleaned and siding of the home repaired and painted. Deficiencies were cleared as of todays inspection. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was left Andrew Sandoval",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst Michelle P. Kyane conducted a case management inspection on April 26, 2022 at 11:39 am based on the number of relevant law enforcement contacts reported by the facility, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1538.7. During this inspection, 8 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 4 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. 3 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 4 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, April 26, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Michelle P. Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Zeana Bey, Clinical Supervisor. Due to a technical error this report was created and provided via email to Shaniz Beza, Interim Executive Director (shaniz@peacockacres.org) for signature on May 2, 2022",

    "narrative": "On 1/27/22, the County received a 14-day notice for a client residing at Peacock Acres. A County representative (CR) claimed they were told the reasoning for this is because Peacock Acres did not have enough staff to safely provide supervision for the client. CR said that the facility mentioned an altercation the youth in question had to show this. This led to the allegations that Peacock Acres does not have sufficient staff, does not provide a safe environment, and a youth was involved in an altercation with another youth while in care. RCR felt that the 14-day notice was unjustified because they felt the client in question was making progress and that they should not be given a 14-day notice because of lack of staffing. On 3/3/22 when LPA Simien asked Peacock Acres about the client\u2019s issues and why a 14-day notice was issued. Peacock Acres explained, since placement, the client has struggled with several behavioral challenges that the program is unable to effectively address. These challenges have continued to impede Client\u2019s ability to make progress towards his treatment goals and have continued to pose a risk to safety of staff and other residents of the program. Included in these challenges are ongoing property destruction, continuing to store and smoke marijuana in the home, verbal threats to kill and/or harm both staff and other residents, theft of Peacock Acres and other resident\u2019s property with intention to sell, and, inciting and provoking another resident to become physically assaultive, punching another resident several times, and ongoing harassment of another resident (refusing to let that resident use the kitchen or exit his room), purposely destroying other resident's property and stalking other residents around the home while posturing and yelling threats and homophobic/transphobic slurs, throwing items at other residents resulting in property damage. The client has been unresponsive to lower level interventions instead requiring police intervention, has been unable to commit to maintaining the ongoing safety of the home and other residents, and voiced his ongoing intention to try to harm other residents. His behaviors have resulted in marked increases in the mental health symptoms of other residents, required Peacock Acres to temporarily place residents in another lower level home to ensure their safety, and have prevented clinical staff from implementing therapeutic components of the program (ex: providing group therapy) due to the need for increased staff ratios to help stabilize the client and maintain safety in the home. When LPA Simien mentioned to Peacock Acres the allegation of not having sufficient staff and that CR claimed that they said they didn\u2019t have enough staff, they said that they are maintaining proper staff-to-client ratios based on ILS V.4 standards. They also mentioned that the client in question is much larger than the average client and that it would take more than one staff member to subdue and redirect the client in question.\n\nThey said they could not risk the whole program for one client. At the time of LPA Simien\u2019s inspection of Peacock Acres on 2/16/22 they had the proper client-to staff ratio. Based on the review of staff schedules from 1/1/22-1/31/22 it showed that Peacock Acres did have the proper client-to-staff ratio, although there is no way LPA Simien can confirm staff worked those shifts. CR said that because Peacock Acres does not have enough staff and the altercations the client in question is having, Peacock Acres does not provide a safe environment. When LPA Simien brought up the allegation that the facility does not provide a safe environment, staff responded by saying they felt they provide a safe environment for clients. They mentioned that some of the clients (including the client in question) behaviors and actions create an unsafe environment. Based on confidential interviews LPA conducted with clients on 2/26/22 clients felt that Peacock acres provided a safe environment and only other clients make them feel unsafe. The clients LPA Simien interviewed mentioned the client in question as creating an unsafe environment. LPA Simien asked clients \u201cHas there been any time you have felt or observed yourself, staff, or other kids being in danger at Peacock?\u201d. They responded, only when the client in question gets upset, this individual tends to physically attack people. They also mentioned that the client in question bullies and attacks them and because of this they do not like the client in question. When LPA Simien brought up the allegation that a youth was involved in an altercation with another youth while in care, staff responded that although altercations happen between clients, they respond to them within CCL regulations. They also mention that the client in question is usually the aggressor in these altercations with other clients. Staff pointed out an incident that occurred on 2/5/22 where the client in question attacked another client in which they had to call law inforcment and the client in question was booked in juvenile hall. On 2/16/22 LPA Simien asked clients, \u201cdo you feel like there are enough staff to stop physical altercations?\u201d. The clients\u2019 responses were mixed. They responded, \u201cyes, staff put a stop to bullying\u201d and \u201ckind of, staff attempts to stop altercations.\u201d Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations . Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated. As a result of this visit, there were no title 22 deficiencies observed. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was to Clarissa Joseph, Residential Manager (RM).",

    "narrative": "On 1/27/22, the County received a 14-day notice for a client residing at Peacock Acre and had a preservation CFT meeting with the facility. The facility explained that the reason for the 14-day notice was that they felt the client question could no longer make therapeutic progress in an environment with peers with behavioral issues and that they became a health and safety risk for clients and staff. Peacock Acres suggested that the client would benefit from being placed in an ITFC resource foster home. CFT Facilitator for the County stated that this was not an option for the client unless they could demonstrate sustained progress for 3 months or longer and that ITFC resource foster homes were in short supply and it was unlikely the County would be able to find one. Peacock Acres also suggest maybe placing the client in Texas to be closer to their Mother. The County responded that they legally could not place client in Texas. When LPA Simien talked to a County representative (CR) about the CFT meeting they claimed they were shocked by the 14-day notice and that Peacock Acres said that the client in question was doing well and progressing clinically. When LPA Simien brought this up to Peacock Acres, they acknowledge that the client did well one-on-one with clinical team but regressed with behavioral issues while with other peers with behavioral issues. On 3/3/22 when LPA Simien asked Peacock Acres about the client\u2019s issues and why a 14-day notice was issued. Peacock Acres explained, since placement, the client has struggled with several behavioral challenges that the program is unable to effectively address. These challenges have continued to impede Client\u2019s ability to make progress towards his treatment goals and have continued to pose a risk to safety of staff and other residents of the program. Included in these challenges are ongoing property destruction, continuing to store and smoke marijuana in the home, verbal threats to kill and/or harm both staff and other residents, theft of Peacock Acres and other resident\u2019s property with intention to sell, and, inciting and provoking another resident to become physically assaultive, punching another resident several times, and ongoing harassment of another resident (refusing to let that resident use the kitchen or exit his room), purposely destroying other resident's property and stalking other residents around the home while posturing and yelling threats and homophobic/transphobic slurs, throwing items at other residents resulting in property damage. The client has been unresponsive to lower level interventions instead requiring police intervention, has been unable to commit to maintaining the ongoing safety of the home and other residents, and voiced his ongoing intention to try to harm other residents. His behaviors have resulted in marked increases in the mental health symptoms of other residents, required Peacock Acres to temporarily place residents in another lower level home to ensure their safety, and have prevented clinical staff from implementing therapeutic components of the program (ex: providing group therapy) due to the need for increased staff ratios to help stabilize the client and maintain safety in the home.\n\nPeacock Acres said they would try to preserve placement if the County could take back the client while they tried to find more staff to be better equipped to handle the client\u2019s behavior issues. The County said that was not possible. Based on conversations with Peacock Acres and CR, there was a miscommunication/misunderstanding regarding the plan of action for the client. Both said that there was an agreement that the client would stay with their mother for two weeks (starting on 2/10/22) while the County found a new placement (with County providing updates). Peacock Acres would attempt to hire more staff to accommodate the client\u2019s behavioral issues. The misunderstanding/miscommunication stems from what would happen after the client\u2019s stay with their mother. The County said there was an expectation that the client would go back to Peacock Acres if no placement was found. Peacock Acres says there was no agreement to accept back the client after their stay with their mother. On 2/18/22, Peacock Acres received an email from the client\u2019s Social Worker stating no placement had been found for client, providing return date for the client and expectations for him to be picked up at the airport. On 2/20/22, Peacock Acres sent an email to the client\u2019s Social Worker informing them of the decision not to accept the client back into the facility following return from home visit due to ongoing safety issues presented by doing so. Peacock Acres provided LPA Simien a screen shot of the email with time stamps to confirm that the email was sent to the Social Worker on 2/20/22. Peacock Acres said they didn\u2019t get a response back from the client\u2019s social worker On 2/22/22, Peacock Acres sent an email with the client\u2019s discharge summary to client\u2019s Social worker. Peacock Acres provided LPA Simien a screen shot of the email with time stamps to confirm the email was sent on 2/22/22. On 2/23/22, Client and their Social Worker flew to San Jose with the expectation that Peacock Acres were going to pick up them up. The County said that Peacock Acres refused to pick up client because of previous 14-day notice and left the client and Social Worker stranded. Once they realize that Peacock Acres was not going to pick up the client, The County tried calling various staff members of Peacock Acres, but no one answered.\n\nThis event lead to the allegations: minor was abandoned while in care, wrongful eviction, minor is being deprived of their possessions, staff are not responsive to requests for communication, and facility\u2019s phone went unanswered. When LPA Simien mentioned to Peacock Acres the allegation minor was abandoned while in care, they mentioned the emails they sent to the client\u2019s Social Worker (mentioned above). They said despite them informing the Social Worker they were not taking back the client and the discharge summary, The County still sent the client and Social Worker to San Jose. When LPA Simien mentioned to Peacock Acres the allegation of wrongful eviction, they said they had a consultation on 2/15 with an Alliance representative regarding the legality of not accepting client back into placement following his two week home visit. Based on this consultation it was determined that the client would not be accepted back following visitation with mother as the County had stopped paying for client's placement after his departure to home visit. The 14 Days to find placement had passed and there was no prior agreement with the County that Peacock Acres would continue placement of client after 14 days. Given client's behaviors prior to leaving on visit and additional events that had occurred in the house, client was increasingly likely to pose ongoing safety risks to the other residents of the home if they returned back. Also, increased staffing beyond required 1:3 staff to client ratio could not be secured to manage this risk. LPA Simien reviewed Peacock Acres Discharge Policy and it states, \u201cReasons for an unplanned discharge, removal, or transfer include but are not limited to 1. Repeated program violations, 2. Health and safety of other residents is endangered by the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s continued presence 3. Repeated or prolonged absences from the facility (AWOLs) 4. If it is determined the facility can no longer meet the needs of the child or youth\u201d. Peacock Acres determined the client triggered reasons two and four for unplanned discharge, removal, or transfer. On 3/3/22 LPA mentioned the allegations facility's phones are not answered, staff are not responsive to requests for communication, and minor is being deprived of their possessions. Peacock Acres said that although they missed the County\u2019s calls on 2/23/22 they had eventually contacted them and were working on sending the rest of the client\u2019s belongings.\n\nOn 7/7/22 LPA Simien contacted CR regarding Peacock Acres claims regarding the allegations against them. Based on this conversation, CR stated that Riverside County had an arrangement with Peacock Acres to meet the client and Social Worker at the airport and gave no indication they were not going to take back the client. CR said that on 2/23/22 none of the various staff members they attempted to contact answered. LPA Simien encouraged CR to send him any correspondence between them and Peacock Acres. As of 7/29/22 CR has only sent LPA a copy of the client\u2019s placement history which showed the County paying for the client\u2019s placement at Peacock Acres until 3/1/22. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations.Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated. As a result of this visit, there were no title 22 deficiencies observed. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was to Clarissa Joseph, Residential Manager (RM).",

    "narrative": "On 11/22/2022 at 9:55 AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Shikya Belfield and Selena Hood conducted an announced visit to the facility. The purpose of this visit was to conduct a Psychotropic Medications Inspection. LPA's Belfield and Hood met with staff member Daniela Flores. At the time of the inspection, there were two staff present and one client in the facility. The facility currently has two clients, both clients are prescribed psychotropic medications. LPA reviewed the both clients' files. During the time of this inspection one client was away on a home visit, therefore they could not be interviewed. The second client could not be interviewed as they were not a dependent placement. LPA's interviewed two staff members while in the facility. LPA's reviewed four staff files and the training records. A walk through of the facility was conducted with staff Flores. During the walk-through it was observed by LPA's Belfield and Hood that there were six pieces of wood with small nails sticking out of each one.

Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Michelle P. Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

When discussing the incident report ED informed LPA Simien that the keys thrown were not office keys and that the client broke into the staff office by breaking into the office. ED stated that they inspected the set of keys and determined that none of the keys had access to anything related to the facility. ED informed LPA that the phone was a staff members and was locked so the client couldn't access the phone. LPA inquired about how the client was able to access the melatonin. ED responded that she was not sure and that Peacock Acres Residential Manager handled the follow up to the incident. ED agreed to send LPA Simien the follow up documents to review.

ED responded by creating a plan of action (this plan of action is also a POC for a related citation). The plan of action in summary: Hiring two part-time staff for the overnight shift. This will allow the overnight shift to have two staff members from 12 AM to 6 AM. The facility will request future CSEC clients to be placed on 1-on-1 supervision ratio from the placing counties/departments.

During the physical inspection of the facility on December 23, 2020, LPA Jose Gonzalez conducted a physical inspection of the facility while LPA Carmen Escobar attended and observed via FaceTime. LPAs met with Direct Care staff Mr. Robert at the start of the inspection. Since there was no facility manager on site, Mr. Rufus, facility manager, was called to come to the facility to complete the inspection with LPAs. The facility is being cited for not having a facility manager on site at time of the inspection while two clients were at the facility. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards chapter 7.5 section 87065, Personnel Requirements. LPA Gonzalez and LPA Escobar also observed that there was no carbon monoxide detector in the facility at the time of the inspection. Also, the bathroom inside bedroom #2 continues to be used by staff but remains locked for the client in that bedroom. Confidential interviews revealed that staff use client bedroom #2 as a passageway to use the bathroom located in the bedroom. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards section 87087, Buildings and Grounds. It was also observed that none of the beds in the facility had all the required linens such as a mattress pad/protector, as well as top and bottom sheets. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards section 87088, Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment and Supplies. The facility does not have a phone that allows clients to make private phone calls. The only working phone at\n\nthe time of the inspection was a corded phone that is in the open office area of the living room, which does not allow for privacy of calls. Also, the window in bedroom #2 has what looked to be like nails or screws in the window track that may obstruct the window when being opened. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards section 87072, Personal Rights. The activities calendar for the facility could not be produced and was not posted. The staff stated there are usually no regular activities planned as the clients do not like to participate and get involved in anything. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards section 87079, Planned Activities. Other observations made will be cited under Title 22 Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations. The first being the condition of the facility. LPA Gonzalez and LPA Escobar observed numerous holes in the walls of the facility, some patched poorly and others painted over poorly. There was a hole by the front living room where the painting was hung, another in the dining room wall, and a bigger one in the hallway. Room #1 also had small holes behind the door in the wall, and several holes were observed in the dry wall throughout the house, such as by the whiteboard. Most concerning were the broken and missing windows in rooms #1, #2, and #3. Room #1 has a missing window and curtains stapled to the wall with no board replacing the missing window. Room #2 has a 1-2 inch gap between the two window panels that allows the outside air to come in. A big piece of plywood was up against the wall, but it does not cover the window gap, nor covers the window. Room #3 has a shattered window that also is not boarded up. The glass shards are hanging off the window frame and are on the floor outside the window. A smoke detector in room #2 is hanging off the ceiling with wires exposed. Room #1 has no electrical outlet plate covers on the outlets, exposing the outlet. There is also what appears to be tagging on the wall that was painted over, but still visible. This is also the case outside in the backyard. There is tagging on the stucco wall and on the concrete patio that is still visible. Finally, the backyard has trash all over the grounds, including cigarette butts, glass pieces, and miscellaneous trash. The palm trees have not been landscaped and are overgrown with dead foliage. Lastly, there are multiple large items in the backyard that were identified as \"trash\" by staff, however, have not been removed. There are mattresses, old chairs, old screens, broken pieces of furniture, and drywall and plywood. Based on observations made the facility will be cited under Title 22 Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations section 80087, Buildings and Grounds. Also during the inspection, it was observed that the majority of windows do not have screens, including the\n\nwindows in all the client's rooms. The trash can in the kitchen does not have a lid or cover on it. The main restroom for the clients has six light bulb outlets but only one bulb was screwed in for light. The sink in this restroom does not drain well and was clogged. The cabinets in the bathroom were in disrepair with a broken drawer on the bottom right side. The shower curtain had stains all over the curtain of an unknown black streaky substance. The counter in the kitchen has chips and the cabinets have stains from what looks to be white paint and brown and white stains from unknown substances. Based on LPA observations, the facility will be cited under Title 22 Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations section 80088, Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment, and Supplies. LPA Escobar and LPA Gonzalez concluded the physical inspection of the property.

While another witness states C1 had S1\u2019s handprint on C1\u2019s neck, LPA was unable to confirm this information from pictures provided to LPA. Several witnesses confirm C1 did spit on S1, escalating the situation with S1. Several witnesses corroborate S1 grabbed C1 by C1\u2019s neck and was pushing C1 around the house, at one point, throwing C1 into the couch in the living area. S1 denies this occurring. Several witnesses corroborate a witness recorded part of this incident on their school Ipad. Another confidential witness was not there at the time of the incident, however, confirms they viewed the recording and states there were also audio recordings where C1 was heard saying \u201cLet me go!\u201d, \u201cStop, get your hands off me!\u201d LPA did not have access to these recordings, however, several witnesses corroborated this did occur and was recorded. S1 denies putting hands on C1 at any point during the altercation stating S1 was only using S1\u2019s hands/arms to block the hits C1 was aiming at S1. The facility is being cited for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards section 87072(d)(10), Personal Rights. It was also alleged that on or around 12/14/20, the facility is in disrepair. It was reported that there are holes in several walls within the facility and there are several wires exposed within the facility. It was detailed that the garage door is broken and several rooms have broken windows, causing concern for client\u2019s safety at the facility. LPA Carmen Escobar was on FaceTime while LPA Jose Gonzalez conducted a physical inspection of the facility on 12/23/20. LPA Gonzalez and LPA Escobar observed numerous holes in the walls of the facility, some patched poorly and others painted over poorly. There was a hole by the front living room where the painting was hung, another in the dining room wall, and a bigger one in the hallway. Room #1 also had small holes behind the door in the wall, and several holes were observed in the dry wall throughout the house, such as by the whiteboard. A smoke detector in room #2 was hanging off the ceiling with wires exposed. Room #1 has no electrical outlet plate covers on the outlets, exposing the outlet wires and electrical sockets. The facility is being cited under Title 22 Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations section 80087, Buildings and Grounds. Based on confidential interviews, information gathered, and LPA\u2019s own observations, the allegations that S1 handled C1 in an inappropriate manner and the facility is in disrepair are SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for each allegation. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Title 22 as well as the Interim Licensing Standards cited above. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were emailed to Ms. Nikki for signature. Original signed reports will be placed in facility file.\n\ncase, the facility provided LPA with a copy of the annual training log showing hours completed by staff in \u201cMedications\u201d training. In reference to the staff administering medication to clients without proper paperwork, the concern is that clients were receiving psychotropic medications with no current JV220 forms. While a confidential witness states the JV220 forms were expired, LPA was unable to corroborate this information. LPA requested most recent JV220 forms along with dates clients were in the home receiving the medication and LPA also reviewed the medication log. Forms were current for current client though a confidential witness states the JV220 forms were incorrect. Finally, it was alleged that the facility has a gas odor due to a leaking pilot light from the gas stove. While a confidential witness states there was a constant odor of gas in the facility, during LPA Gonzalez\u2019s physical inspection of the home, there was no odor of gas and the pilot was in working order. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that staff at the facility are not trained, staff are administering medications without proper paperwork, and that the facility has an odor of gas, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited.

The purpose of the inspection was to address issues and concerns regarding an incident that occurred on or around December 14, 2020. It was discovered through information received via confidential interviews and LPA Carmen Escobar\u2019s and LPA Jose Gonzalez's own observations that the STRTP\u2019s administrator is not at the facility the minimum twenty hours required per Interim Licensing Standards. Per the facility\u2019s LIC 500 form for that week of the physical inspection, the administrator was scheduled to work at the facility on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 11 AM until 5 PM. When LPA Jose Gonzalez conducted a physical inspection of the facility on Wednesday, December 23, 2020, during that period of time, the administrator never arrived and was not on grounds at the facility. Confidential interviews revealed that the administrator will stop by the facility randomly on occasion for a small amount of time, however, the administrator is not at the facility on regularly scheduled days and times. Current LIC 500 states the administrator is \u201con call\u201d but no specific schedule hours were provided. Additionally, all confidential interviews corroborate administrator is hardly at the facility on a weekly basis. Based on confidential interviews and document review, Community Care Licensing (CCL) is citing the facility under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Section 87064: Administrator Qualifications and Duties. It was also discovered that staff have not received annual training as required. The facility provided LPA with copies of the annual training log showing hours completed by staff and topics covered. Training records did not show sufficient training hours as required for the year 2020. Per administration, training is occurring online due to COVID19 therefore the facility was unable to provide more specific documentation of completed training, such as a sign-in sheet for staff participation. Annual training hours for staff have not been met per the training records obtained. Several confidential witnesses state they never received the\n\nrequired new hire training at hire, have not received the required annual training, and have been working for the facility for one or more years. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Section 87065.1: Training Requirements.

    "narrative": "On February 25, 2021, at 9:30 AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carmen Escobar and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Jennifer Smith met with Lawrence Thomas, CEO of Pennacle Foundation Inc, Dr. Cynthia Powell, Administrator/Therapist, Rejeena Marshall, Assistant Administrator, Amy Guisa, acting San Bernardino County STRTP (Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program) Coordinator, Watishi Turner, facility manager, Terry Landreaux, facility manager, and Dionne Thomas, facility manager, via Microsoft Teams for a virtual office meeting due to COVID 19. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss issues and concerns regarding the facility and to bring the facility into compliance with Title 22 Regulations and STRTP Interim Licensing Standards. LPM Smith summarized the facility\u2019s deficiencies occurring since the last office meeting completed with the facility on January 23, 2020. LPM and LPA discussed concerns that have arose due to information gathered from confidential interviews and inspections with the facility. LPM and LPA reviewed issues, concerns and plan of corrections that need to be addressed in order to bring the facility into compliance with Title 22 Regulations and STRTP Interim Licensing Standards. Items covered during the meeting included: -Reoccurring Building and Grounds deficiencies concerning broken windows in client rooms, trash in yard, contraband trash, holes in walls, exposed wires in client rooms, and general cleanliness of facility. Maintenance of facility was discussed. The need for the facility to be kept in clean and safe condition for clients was expressed by LPA and LPM. CEO stated a checklist for building maintenance for ongoing repairs has been implemented at the facility and a staff has been\n\ndesignated as a physical plant manager to ensure the buildings and ground are maintained. -Administrator Qualifications and Duties: Administrator is not on the premises for a minimum of 20 hours per week to manage and administer the STRTP in compliance with applicable law and regulation. CEO stated that due to Administrator's \"high risk\" category for COVID 19 and the Administrator living with her elderly parent, the Administer is unable to be at the facility. LPA was not unaware of the Administrator\u2019s special circumstance. CEO Thomas stated he will send LPA a letter to explain this situation and to designate an Assistant Administrator as the acting Administrator during this time of COVID 19 or until the Administrator receives a COVID 19 vaccination allowing her to be at the facility a minimum of 20 hours as required by ILS. -Training Requirements: staff have not received the required annual training. Per CEO, a majority of the staff have only been with the facility for 4-5 months. CEO will send a training calendar to show training planned for 2021 to meet the required ILS 40 hours of training as part of a plan of correction (POC) that is due on 02/26/21. CEO requested the POC be extended to 03/05/21. Also, a facility staff was required to be retrained for Personal Rights and LPA has not yet received proof of this POC which was due on 02/19/21. CEO stated he did not recall this report/POC being received. CEO requested an extension for this POC and it was agreed the POC would be submitted by 3/5/21. -Buildings & Grounds: It was discussed that no bedroom shall be used as a public or general passageway to another room, bath or toilet. Facility was cited for bedroom #2 serving as a passageway for staff to use the restroom occupied by a client. CEO states the room is now empty as there is only one client at the facility and while staff are allowed to use the restroom right now, the restroom will be locked once a client is assigned to that bedroom. CEO will send a photo of the empty room (as beds are being fixed) to LPA for previous POC that was due on 01/08/21. -Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment and Supplies: Another POC not received is that client beds do not\n\nhave the required linens such as a mattress pad or protector as well as top and bottom sheets. CEO mentioned picture was sent to LPA by POC due date, will resend for POC clearance by LPA. -It was further discussed with facility representatives that the facility currently has a provisional STRTP license and the facility needs to be in compliance with Title 22 Regulations and STRTP ILS in order for the facility to be issued a permanent license. LPM mentioned that while this is a (virtual) \"office meeting\", the next step could be a non-compliance meeting. CEO expressed the need to find a qualified individual, who lives closer to the facility, to take over as administrator to put in the time and work the program requires, however, states Ms. Rejeena has been doing most of the management of the facility at this time. LPM and LPA summarized the issues covered during the meeting and clarified to the facility representatives that CCL's (Community Care Licensing's) purpose of the meeting is to bring the facility into ILS compliance as the regulations for an STRTP are much more detailed and demanding than the group home regulations. As long as there is communication with CCL/LPA, there are ample opportunities to bring the facility into compliance. CEO expressed his concern with the hold San Bernardino County currently has on the facility and Ms. Guisa expressed she would follow-up with CEO once the remaining POCs have been completed and cleared. LPA and LPM open the meeting up for any additional comments or questions from facility staff and nothing was asked of LPA or LPM. Meeting was concluded. A copy of this report was provided to CEO Thomas and a signed copy of this report will be placed in the facility file.",

LPA met with facility manager (FM) Tina Gordon. The purpose of the visit is to conduct an annual inspection of the facility. There was one staff and zero clients present at the time of the inspection. Appropriate staff/client ratios were verified during the inspection, however, the two clients currently placed in the STRTP were at school. LPA conducted the physical inspection 11:50 AM. FM Tina Gordon led the physical inspection of the facility. The facility consists of three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The facility has a dining area, kitchen area, and living room/common area that also houses the make-shift staff office. The facility also has an attached garage where the washer and dryer are located. The facility does not have a clinician's office for therapeutic services, therefore, counseling and therapy is currently being provided . Staff area is located in the open common area adjacent to the main living room. All bedrooms have two individual twin beds and adequate drawer space for each client. Because there are only two clients placed in the STRTP, they each have their own room. The facility ensures that there is one client per bed with appropriate linens, pillows, comforters, and mattresses in good repair. Facility grounds are clean and free of debris and observable hazards. There is adequate indoor and outdoor activity space for the clients. Books, board games, movies, a TV, and video game system, were observed for client\u2019s recreation time.

    "narrative": "An informal conference was held with Pennacle Foundation Inc. Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) to discuss current Community Care Licensing (CCL) concerns. Present at the meeting was LaCresha Cook, Regional Manager, Jennifer Smith, Licensing Program Manager, Carmen Escobar, Licensing Program Analyst, Lawrence Thomas, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Carolyn Ruffin, Administrator, Dr. Sandra Butler, Board member, Jenell Ross, Riverside Department Public Social Services, Diana Wagner and Stacie Kinney, System of Care Branch, Karen Atkins, Riverside County Placement Liaison, David Gutierrez, Sandi Snelgrove, and Alexandria Andrews, Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), and Nisha Elliott, Riverside Behavioral Health. The following information was discussed: 1. Lack of oversight by management. 2. CCL unable to verify work hours of Administrator and hours present in the facility 3. Lack of trauma informed programming and activities for clients 4. Facility Managers unaware of Facility Manager Training 5. Lack of communication between Facility Management 6. Facility records unorganized and unavailable upon request 7. Clarification of mental health services being provided to clients. 8. Lack of Accreditation, Mental Health Contract, Medi-Cal Approval. 9. Lack of response to Department Health Care Services for denial of Mental Health Application. 10. Staff are not qualified. 11. Staff are not being adequately trained. 12. Plans of correction are incomplete and submitted late. 13. Core services, lack of trauma informed care.\n\nwho are San Bernardino County placements, are receiving mental health services in Riverside County. This could cause billing issues for the facility. Administrator stated she would obtain clarification on this. 8. CEO and Administrator confirmed the STRTP does not have accreditation, however, are working with CARF representative and have obtained the services of Maria Sarkisian to assist with the application process. CEO confirmed program does not have an approved mental health program as the application was returned by DHCS due to being incomplete. The facility has also not received Medi-Cal approval. 9. The mental health program application (MHPA) submitted by the facility to the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) was incomplete. DHCS stated the STRTP staff did not respond to the letter that was sent advising that the MHPA was incomplete. CEO stated he was unaware any response to the letter was necessary. DHCS advised the approval process is lengthy and expressed concern that the program may run out of time as the STRTP\u2019s second extension expires on 03/18/22. 10. CCL stated STRTP staff need to be re-valuated to confirm facility managers are qualified to be facility managers. LPA mentioned how not having a Facility Manager at the facility has been a reoccurring issue in the past, so somewhere along the line, all direct care workers were converted to Facility Managers, therefore, any staff working would also be the Facility Manager on site. LPA cited that several facility managers, upon file review, do not meet the requirements specified in the ILS either with education or experience. Almost all employees were hired after January 1, 2017, meaning they were not grandfathered into the STRTP program. Administrator states staff qualifications will be re-evaluated, however, feels this concern might only apply to one staff. Administrator stated they have been having issues with Guardian taking several months to clear a staff. Regional Manager Cook advised that if Guardian is taking a excessive amount of time the facility should reach out to LPA Escobar and LPM Smith for assistance. 11. CCL discussed a previous citation due to lack of training for staff. The annual training hours were incomplete, and upon confidential interviews with staff, many could not recall when the last training provided by administration had occurred. Concern was expressed towards facility staff's lack of understanding of trauma informed care. LPA stated upon interviewing facility staff, several employees were unable to define \u201ctrauma-informed care\u201d. Additionally, during these confidential interviews, it was determined staff are not receiving\n\n14. Lack of trauma informed milieu 15. CEO and Facility Managements Lack of knowledge of STRTP Requirements and Standards of Care 16. TSP Referral Information covered during the informal conference includes: 1. CEO was unaware of most STRTP requirements and has delegated all operational authority to facility Administrator. Board minutes were discussed, including the need for the Board to spend more time addressing the issues of Pennacle Foundation in Lake Elsinore, as many agendas and meeting minutes provided to LPA addressed the Pennacle facility in Fresno. While the facility has many concerning issues occurring at this time, as noted above, they are not a priority per the agendas and minutes provided to LPA. CCL/LPA expressed the need for Board of Directors to be much more involved, provide more oversight to facility, and aware of all issues occurring with the facility. CEO stated he is the direct contact with the Board of Directors, therefore, it was requested for CEO to better communicate facility issues/conditions to the Board. LPA also requested a Board meeting be conducted to address the facility issues addressed during this informal conference. CEO stated he will definitely fill the Board of Directors in on all the concerns expressed by each department in today\u2019s meeting CCL and DHCS recommended the CEO become more familiar with the program and provide more oversight and work more closely with the Administrator and Mental Health Head of Service to ensure successful implementation of statutory and regulatory STRTP requirements. 2. STRTP submitted documentation to CCL that did not verify the work hours of Administrator nor the hours present in the facility. The documentation lacked dates, times, and hours. 3. STRTP is not providing a full program to clients, as seen on the activities calendar for clients. Activities scheduled include things such as movies and visits to park or local YMCA. LPA stated during the three consecutive days of STRTP\u2019s annual in September, the activities listed on the calendar did not occur. CCL requested for activities provided to clients to be more trauma-informed based on the specific trauma-informed care model being followed by the program. 4. During past confidential interviews with staff, LPA was told by staff that they are unsure\n\nif they are considered a Facility Manager. Several staff could not confirm whether or not they had been trained as a Facility Manager. Some facility managers thought they were still \u201cdirect care staff\u201d as they were previously. CCL expressed concern with the training being provided to staff, especially since a Facility Manager is required to be on-site when clients are at the facility, per regulations. 5. CCL addressed the lack of communication between management. CEO confirmed that facility\u2019s upper management/administration is busy trying to keep up with all the pending requirements that sometimes, they do not fill each other in quickly enough to know what may have recently occurred or developed within the program. Regional Manager Cook stated the Board of Directors, CEO, and Administrator, all need to better communicate to get everyone on same page with facility concerns. CEO agreed. 6. LPA addressed facility\u2019s common practice of staff files to be stored \u201coff grounds\u201d, sometimes taking hours to be brought to the facility. CCL stated all hard copies of files need to be stored at the facility for reviewing purposes. Though Administrator generally offers to email copies of necessary documents to LPA, it was made clear by CCL all files need to be stored at the facility. LPA confirmed staff files were brought to the Regional Office for review and will be ready for pick up on Monday, December 13, 2021. Documentation of mental health service hours were also discussed. DHCS specifically addressed the need for detailed records including dates, times, and hours, etc. of services provided for each client. The program needs to create a more detailed documentation system. Per DHCS, hours, and additional details, need to be clearly recorded for audit purposes. Same issues exist for documentation of staff training hours. Administrator agreed to get files organized and completed. 7. Administrator states client 1 and client 2 are both being provided mental health services in Riverside County (Lake Elsinore), though they are both San Bernardino County placements. LPA read from facility\u2019s program statement stating the clients in the program will receive 1-2 sessions per week of individual therapy and will have group therapy sessions once a week. DHCS pointed out that since the STRTP does not have an approved mental health care program, they cannot be providing these services to clients as of yet. Administrator confirmed clients are receiving off-site mental health care services at this time. Administrator was unsure as to which county provides Medi-Cal to clients. Riverside Behavioral Health expressed there needs to be clarification as to why the clients\n\nthe required hours of annual training. Training records submitted to LPA previously do not provide the necessary information required per Interim Licensing Standards. LPA advised facility better documentation is needed showing course title and subject matter, learning objectives and activities, number of hours per training session, qualification of trainer, and training evaluation. There should also be a way to confirm staff attendance, either attendance sheet with signature, electronic signature, time stamp records, etc. Supporting documentation of training, if available, should also be provided. Hours completed for each training should be clear for reviewing parties. 12. Plans of corrections (POCs) provided to LPA are generally incomplete and/or untimely. CCL expressed the need for more detailed documentation and records as expressed above. Additionally, CCL confirmed LPA will be following-up with the plans of correction in a timely manner to more quickly bring the facility into compliance. It was also stated that civil penalties are a possible consequence of repeat citations if they are not being properly or sufficiently cleared. LPA expressed a vital component of this occurring is simply the need for more detailed and organized documentation by the facility. Administrator agreed and stated she is always good about submitting everything on time, however, past POCs have been untimely. 13. While trauma informed care is described in the facility's program statement, System of Care Branch and Riverside Regional Office both stated that additional updates are required because the trauma informed sections are not specific and lack detail. 14. System of Care Branch advised a clear trauma informed, evidence-based, model needs to be referred to throughout the entire program statement. This is necessary because depending on the model being used, the trauma-informed practices should be specific to that model; every aspect of trauma informed should be addressed in detail and not described in a general manner. 15. CCL and DHCS recommended the CEO become more familiar with the program and provide more oversight and work more closely with the Administrator and Mental Health Head of Service to ensure successful implementation of statutory and regulatory STRTP requirements. 16. A Technical Support Program (TSP) referral will be made by CCL in order for facility to obtain assistance with the implementation of statutory and regulatory STRTP requirements. Administrator stated that she was planning on requesting help from TSP.\n\nThe facility has agreed to the following: 1. Staff will submit a Plan of Action to CCL within 30 days, due January 7, 2022. The plan should address updates to the facility's current program statement core services, staff training section including program trainer requirements, trauma informed activities that will be provided to clients and how the activities are developed or selected. 2. Update to program statement should include a clear, evidence-based trauma informed model of care and how this model will be implemented. 3. Program statement should address how trauma informed milieu will be provided to clients. This should include how clinical staff will be working with current staff, including regarding technical interventions. 4. Staff will provide anticipated hire dates for two Mental Health Specialists that are in process of being hired by facility. 5. Administrator hours will be addressed in terms of increased hours at facility, how administrator will provide additional oversight to facility and perspective dates of hire for a permanent administrator and assistant administrator will be provided. 6. Updated LIC500 will be produced reflecting exact Administrator schedule and a detailed sign-in sheet will be created, displaying date, time in, time out, staff signature, etc. CCL has requested finger-print attendance records from August 2021 through the December 9, 2021 for the Administrator. 7. Plan of action will include plan for ensuring Facility Manager is present at all times when clients are at the STRTP. 8. Plan will include how staff qualifications will be re-evaluated (specifically Facility Manager staff). 9. Perspective dates of hire for a Head of Service will be provided. 10. Facility activities schedule from October 2021 through December 9, 2021 will be provided to CCL, along with supporting documentation (such as receipts). Examples of trauma-informed activities to be completed with clients will be provided to CCL. An activity schedule for the next six months will be provided to CCL. 11. Staff training documentation will be reassessed to include all the information required per Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) regulations. Training records will be updated to reflect the ILS requirements.\n\nUpon conclusion of the meeting, Pennacle Foundation representatives were advised the goal of the informal conference is to bring the facility into compliance, especially since the STRTP's provisional license expires March 18, 2022. It was also advised that if the Plan of Action is not approved or adhered to, the next step would be conducting a non-compliance conference with the facility, which may result in administrative action. CEO, Lawrence Thomas, was advised the report (LIC809) will be provided via email for signature. Conference was concluded.",

    "narrative": "On February 17, 2022, at 1:10 PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carmen Escobar arrived at Pennacle Foundation Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) to conduct a Case Management inspection to determine compliance with the Plan of Action created during the informal conference that occurred with Pennacle Foundation on December 9, 2021. This Plan of Action had an original due date of January 07, 2022, however, Pennacle Foundation CEO, Lawrence Thomas, requested an extension. The extension was granted and extended with a new due date of January 21, 2022. The Plan of Action for Pennacle Foundation was received on January 25, 2022. Upon review of the Plan of Action, several items that should have been addressed and completed by the deadline of January 21, 2022, were not. The Plan of Action stated these items were being reviewed and worked on and would be submitted by February 04, 2022. As of the date of this facility inspection, February 17, 2022, the remaining Plan of Action items have not been completed and will be addressed by LPA Escobar during this case management inspection. During the physical inspection of the facility, LPA Escobar observed no health and safety concerns. During the facility inspection, LPA Escobar requested to see facility\u2019s Activities Calendar along with accompanying receipts/logs to support scheduled activities. While staff was able to provide some receipts to LPA, activities scheduled on calendar (such as groups) do not have sign-in sheets/information of who led group, what was covered on each date for each group meeting. Additionally, there are no activities being led or conducted by community groups/resources. Confidential statements also corroborate that the facility continues to lack planned activities/outings. Administrator was unaware all clients in the facility are off from school the following day, Friday, February 18, 2022, and Monday, February 21, 2022, therefore, no special outings have been planned. Facility is being cited under Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) section 87078.1(a)(3) Core Services and Supports. The facility is being assessed a civil penalty due to repeating the same violation within twelve months.\n\nLPA Escobar requested the updated Staff Training Plan with updated training hours for staff, however, Administrator states she is still working on this and was unaware a date of February 4, 2022, had been given to LPA as the expected submission date. The Staff Training Plan was discussed during the informal conference and was expected to be submitted, along with current training hours for each staff member, by January 21, 2022. Nothing has been submitted in regards to training from facility. The facility is being cited under section 87065.1(a)(7) Supervision, Evaluation, and Training Requirements as well as Title 22 section 80066(C) Personnel Records for not having personnel training records available for review. The facility is being assessed a civil penalty for each of these citations due to repeating the same violations within twelve months. Additionally, LPA requested the visitor sign-in log to verify actual dates and times that Facility Administrator, Carolyn Ruffin, has been at the facility as discussed in the Informal Conference. Administrator was able to provide both the time clock record of hours worked along with dated sign in sheets for the facility. Upon review of client files, it was observed that three of three client files did not have current, updated, signed Needs and Service Plans. LPA requested the most current plans be reviewed by clients, signed, and provided to LPA within seven days. The facility is being cited under ILS section 87070(c)(1) Children's Records. The facility is being assessed a civil penalty for each of these citations due to repeating the same violations within twelve months. LPA requested for Administrator to submit a revised LIC500, Personnel Report, to LPA with updated staff work schedules/titles/etc. by Friday, February 18, 2022. The Facility Manager scheduled for day shift for tomorrow, February 18, 2022, does not meet qualifications and does not have an approved exception from Community Care Licensing. Administrator was advised that a qualified facility manager needs to be present whenever clients are at the facility. Administrator agreed and stated will be making modifications to the staff schedule. LPA provided Administrator a copy of this report, along with accompanying LIC421FCs, a copy of the Children's Residential PIN 17-02-CCLD: AB221 Care Facilities: Civil Penalties, and also appeal rights print out. An exit interview was conducted and all documents were discussed with Facility Administrator, Carolyn Ruffin.",

    "narrative": "**This is an amended report of the original dated January 19, 2022** adequately supervise minors in care, facility staff allow C2 to smoke cigarettes while in care, and facility does not provide C1 a safe environment. Specifically, it was reported that C2 has been punching C1 in the stomach daily for two weeks and when this is brought to staff\u2019s attention, staff don\u2019t do anything to stop C2 from doing this. Additionally, it was reported that C2 smokes cigarettes outside the STRTP and staff are aware but do not do anything about this. It was also reported that C2 has threatened to hit C1 more if C1 tells staff that C2 is hitting C1. Per allegation details, a witness does not feel safe in the STRTP. While a witness maintains all of the allegation details are true and occurred as reported, another witness denies all allegations. FM confirmed C2 would intentionally hit C1 on occasion, however, this was not due to lack of supervision, as staff was supervising the clients when this occurred. This was C2\u2019s behavior when arrived at the STRTP. Staff redirected C2 and separated C2 from C1 immediately in each incident. Staff confirmed C2 will look for used cigarette butts while on outings and will sneak them into the STRTP to attempt to smoke them. Staff corroborate that they confiscate the cigarette butts when this occurs as C1 knows this is against STRTP rules. Staff corroborate clients are supervised on a continuous basis due to their behaviors and conditions, however, C2 is more independent and does push STRTP boundaries regardless of staff supervision. LPA reviewed C2\u2019s needs and service plan and observed there is nothing in the plan stating C2 requires constant supervision. Staff corroborate they have never witnessed C2 threaten C1. Additionally, staff corroborate that C1 has never mentioned the above allegations to staff to be addressed. Also, CSW states C1 has never reported allegations to CSW and CSW has never had concerns with the care being offered at the STRTP. A couple of witnesses confirm they feel safe in the STRTP despite the allegations reported. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that C1 is getting hit by C2 while in care without staff intervening, staff do not adequately supervise minors in care, facility staff allow C2 to smoke cigarettes while in care, and facility does not provide C1 a safe environment, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegation is, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were provided to Ms. Watishi Turner for original signature. Signed report will be placed in facility file.",

    "narrative": "On February 28, 2022, at 12:25 PM, Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Carmen Escobar and Lisi Leon arrived at Pennacle Foundation Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) to conduct a Case Management inspection to address the facility's compliance with the Plan of Action created during the informal conference that occurred with Pennacle Foundation on December 9, 2021, and the plan of correction documents received by LPA Escobar on February 24, 2022. LPA Escobar conducted a physical inspection of the facility at this time and did not observe any immediate health or safety concerns. Upon review of the Plan of Correction documents, it was observed that the Training Plan and training records from February 2021 through February 2022 did not show a comprehensive total hours trained for each staff member. Staff names were used on some records while staff phone numbers were used in other training records. Five of the six staff employed by the facility for over one year, have accrued less than the required 40 hours of annual training in this past year, per the records provided. Also, the records indicated 1.5 hours of training completed by an outside entity, in this case, one training was completed by the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. Per Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), a minimum of 20 hours of annual training should be conducted by an entity other than the STRTP. The facility is being cited under ILS section 87065.1, Supervision, Evaluation, and Training Requirements. Also, the remaining Plan of Action item in reference to the Activities, deficiency 87078.1(a)(3) Core Services and Supports was not submitted to LPA Escobar by the due date of February 24, 2022. The facility is being assessed a civil penalty for failing to correct the deficiency due February 24, 2022. Additionally, because the facility has not provided sufficient evidence in this area, though it was indicated during the annual inspection that S3 is in charge of\n\nactivities, the facility is being cited under ILS section 87065 Personnel Requirements. Due to the facility's continued lack of oversight of the program as seen in the failure to correct the plans of corrections or inadequately correcting the previously cited issues and the repeated lack of communication amongst STRTP administration, the facility is being cited under ILS section 87063 Accountability. LPA provided Facility Manager, Mr. Zachary Williams, a copy of this report, along with accompanying LIC421FCs, and appeal rights print out, and an exit interview was conducted.",

S1, allegedly, became upset and turned off the TV. C1 became angry and turned the TV back on. It was then reported that S1 got in C1\u2019s face, telling C1 to leave the TV alone. C1 requested for S1 to \u201cget out of (C1\u2019s) face\u201d and shoved S1 when S1 did not remove self from C1 personal space. There was a power struggle between C1 and S1 as C1 pushed S1 and S1 attempted to redirect C1. They were witnessed to have ended up wrestling near the couch and landed on the floor of the facility living room. Allegedly, S1 proceeded to push C1 down the hallway in an effort to put C1 in C1\u2019s room. Several corroborating statements confirm S1 was raising S1\u2019s voice while attempting to get C1 to go to C1\u2019s room. Confidential witnesses state S1 attempted to restrain C1 during the altercation. Several witnesses corroborate seeing S1 put hands on C1 in an attempt to redirect and restrain C1 from potentially hitting S1. Other witnesses corroborate hearing C1 yell, several times, \u201cGet your hands off me!\u201d to S1. During the investigation, S1 confirmed S1 put hands on C1, stating S1 attempted to put C1 in a child pose, one-arm restraint, which S1 states S1 is trained to conduct. S1 also confirmed S1 tried to physically turn C1 around to redirect C1 to C1\u2019s room, however, was only able to \u201cmaintain control of (C1\u2019s) forearms\u201d. Corroborating statements confirm that eventually S1 and C1 released their holds on each other and C1 retreated to C1\u2019s room. Another confidential witness confirms seeing S1 restrain C1\u2019s arms as C1 yelled, \u201cGet your hands off me!\u201d and both of them struggling with each other like they were going to fall on the floor during the incident. Based on confidential interviews, information gathered, and review of the facility\u2019s program statement which states restraints are not to be used on clients, the allegation that S1 engaged in a physical altercation with C1 while in care is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for the allegation. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) section 87095, General Provisions.

    "narrative": "the pills were vitamins and there was also nothing mentioned by authorized representative that the pills were vitamins. Even though C1 advised S2 the pills were vitamins, S2 could not confirm this information and for C1\u2019s safety, flushed the vitamins down the toilet. S2 was unaware of a proper way to dispose of drugs/pills and later participated in staff training that provided instructions on proper disposal of medication/pills/drugs and also proper documentation. Another witness observed the actual flushing of the vitamins and became upset with S2 at time of incident. Other witnesses corroborate that even though they did not witness the flushing of the vitamins, they were made aware by upper administration/management, that this incident had occurred prior to the staff training that was completed. Based on confidential interviews and information gathered, the allegation that S2 flushed C1\u2019s vitamins while in care is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for the allegation. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Interim Licensing Standards section 87072, Personal Rights. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were provided to FM, Candice Caldwell, for signature. Original signed reports will be placed in facility file.\n\nSpecifically, it was reported that C1 has been denied access to C1\u2019s phone book. Several witnesses corroborate this is not true and C1 has constant access to any phone numbers C1 might need, including CSW\u2019s, county representatives, legal entities, etc. It was also detailed that S1 gets in C1\u2019s face and yells at C1, however, no details of this were reported. It was further reported that S1 will say things such as, \u201cIf (C2) sticks (C2\u2019s) thumb up your (C1\u2019s) butt, you\u2019re gay right?\u201d While two witnesses corroborate these two allegations, all other witnesses state this has never been observed and S1 does not yell at clients or says things as indicated on report. Several other witnesses state these incidents have never been reported to them during C1\u2019s time at the facility. It was also reported S1 refuses to make C1 food, however, all witnesses corroborate that while several staff, including S1, do not cook for the clients in the facility at times, staff will order food or pick up fast food for clients. While S1 states S1 does not cook and does not like to cook, S1 states S1 will buy clients fast food or will order food for clients, including C1. Several other witnesses corroborate this information, some even stating they would rather eat fast food than eat food cooked by staff. Again, other witnesses advise this has not been reported to them during C1\u2019s time at the facility. It was then detailed that S1 threatened to make C1 food with a dirty plate or food that is contaminated. S1 denies this allegation stating C1 can be unhygienic and S1 will have to remind C1 to not touch C1\u2019s private parts and then touch plates in the kitchen, or food in the kitchen, as it will contaminate items with unhygienic germs. Another witness denies this occurring. Several witnesses corroborated this incident, advising S1 was not threatening C1, but was advising of proper hygiene when eating and preparing food. This incident was also not shared with other parties and, therefore, not witnessed. It was further detailed that C1 does not have access to TV or WiFi in the facility, causing C1 to be bored. Several staff deny this allegation and advise the TV and internet are always available to C1 as long as C1 has completed chores and has not lost privileges. While a witness maintains this continues to occur, several other witnesses deny this allegation, stating the TV is always on and staff usually allow clients to use the WiFi when requested. Finally, it was also reported that C1 has not been enrolled in school, however, the facility provided documentation of the ongoing enrollment process which has taken longer than usual, but not due to lack of effort by the facility, simply issues with school district in regards to C1\u2019s educational needs and behavioral issues. While a witness maintains this was the case initially, the facility has now been able to enroll C1 into school. S1 denies all allegations related to S1 and C1. While another witness maintains the allegations are true, several witnesses deny ever observing these allegations occur. Based on interviews conducted, the allegations that S1 denied C1 access to phone book, S1 yells at C1 while in care, S1 makes inappropriate comments towards C1, S1 refused to make food for C1 while in\n\ncare, S1 threatened C1 while in care, staff deny C1 access to activities while in care, and C1 is not enrolled into school while in care may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited.

Based on the analysis of the youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Veronica Whitaker observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Carolyn Ruffin, Administrator.",

LPA confirmed this information upon review of client medication records for months of September and October 2022. Additionally, the reason for missed medication was not provided on some entries. Staff corroborate they were unaware of some of the required information needed on medication log records. The facility is being cited for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards section 87070(13)(G)(1), Children\u2019s Records. Based on confidential interviews, information gathered, and LPA\u2019s own observation and review of client medication logs, the allegation staff do not adequately maintain minor\u2019s medication records is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for the allegation. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited the Interim Licensing Standards cited above.

While a witnesses maintains all the allegation details are correct, all other witnesses corroborate that the details of each allegation are untrue. Witnesses corroborate that while there may have been an old food menu on the fridge on at least one occasion, the menu is usually updated, however, clients request to eat out or would rather order food other than the food being cooked. LPA observed clients have scheduled laundry days and as long as clients are capable of doing their laundry the washer and dryer are available to clients for laundry needs. C1 has not wanted to do C1\u2019s laundry and keeps C1\u2019s room messy, regardless of being asked to pick up C1\u2019s clothes. Staff have also done C1\u2019s laundry on several occasions, as C1 does not complete C1\u2019s chores. Based on interviews conducted, the allegations that minors are not provided a food menu, C1\u2019s laundry needs are not being met, minors are not being provided a comfortable temperature, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited.

During the meeting, LPM Smith stated the meeting was to follow up on the facility status in obtaining Mental Health Program Approval through the Department of Health Care Services. LPM Smith reminded the STRTP CEO Mr. Thomas that the STRTP provisional expiration date and expiration of Waiver of Time is June 30, 2023. RM Cook inquired about the facility\u2019s plan in case the STRTP is not able to have a mental health contract with a county prior to the license expiration date. RM Cook inquired as to whether the facility had a plan to operate a different facility type. RM Cook stated that in addition to obtaining the mental health county contract, the facility would also have to get Medi-Cal certification, which is part of the Mental Health Program Approval process. RM Cook stated the process can take several months to complete. CEO Mr. Thomas explained that Pennacle Foundation Inc. has not yet received a Mental Health contract with Fresno or through San Bernardino County and missed the deadline to apply which was on 03/06/2023.

Ms. Ruffin mentioned that there has not yet been any formal discussion regarding this option, but it is being considered as a possible alternative as well. RM Cook requested that Pennacle Foundation Inc. submit a closure plan by 03/20/2023 clearly indicating the next steps that will be taken to implement the facilities plan for merger or closure.

Confidential interview continued stating that during the incident LFM embraced C1 by placing both arms around C1. Confidential interview stated that law enforcement arrived to respond to C1\u2019s behaviors and spoke to C1 and LFM about the incident. LPA Urena obtained a 24-hour notice and a Law Enforcement Report dated 10/26/22 that states \u201cC1 was moving so aggressively that LFM laid on C1 for approximately two minutes while trying to calm the client and de-escalate the situation\u201d. Another confidential interview stated that clients have expressed concerns about being mishandled by staff while in care but denied that staff were intentionally mistreating clients in care and added that staff are trained on how to respond to emergency situations. It was discovered that during the process of responding to C1\u2019s behaviors LFM did use a one-person restraint as a method of de-escalation. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegation that LFM mishandled C1 while in care, is supported and proven by evidence. The facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) version four Section 87072(c)(11) PERSONAL RIGHTS. Exit interview was conducted.

Another confidential interview declined to provide any comments due to C1\u2019s short stay at the facility, and C1 could not be reached for an interview. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegations. Regarding the allegation that C1 engaged in a physical altercation with another client, a confidential interview stated that there was a fight that resulted in C1 being body slammed by another client in care. Confidential interview continued stating not being sure what occurred but maintained that C1 wanted to return to county of origin and was willing to make false allegations to get relocated. Other confidential interviews denied witnessing an altercation between C1 and another client. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegation that staff choked C1 while in care, staff handled C1 in an inappropriate manner, and that C1 engaged in a physical altercation with another minor while in care, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted.

    "narrative": "On January 31, 2023, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received complaints alleging that minor consumed alcohol and smoked marijuana on the premises, minor sustained injuries while in care, minor engaged in physical altercations while in care, and that staff did not intervene while minor was engaged in physical altercations. Regarding the allegations that C1 consumed alcohol and smoked marijuana on the premises, confidential interviews reported that C1 had a history of substance use prior to placement and was found in possession of drug paraphernalia on multiple occasions while in care. Confidential interviews further reported that it is unknown where C1 obtained marijuana or alcohol while in care but added that C1 left the facility without permission frequently. Confidential interviews reported that staff confiscated and discarded marijuana and other drug paraphernalia from C1 resulting in aggressive behaviors towards staff and ultimately C1\u2019s termination from placement. LPA received reports to support that C1 was in possession of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia while in care. However, C1 could not be reached for comment regarding the allegation that C1 consumed alcohol and marijuana on the premises. Regarding the allegations that minor sustained injuries while in care, minor engaged in physical altercations while in care and that staff did not intervene while minor was engaged in physical altercations, SI Jackson received information that C1 was involved in an incident resulting in injuries. It was reported that during an outing with staff and peers C1 required medical attention due to an incident resulting in a face injury from playing with another youth in care. It was further reported that during this incident staff were present and provided C1 with the medical attention and follow-up care needed. Other confidential interviews reported that C1 engaged in multiple fights with peers where C1 was the aggressor. Confidential interviews further reported that C1 had ongoing aggressive behaviors that resulted in altercations with peers, but maintained that staff intervened during these altercations and on some occasions, resulting in law enforcement contacts. The Department received inconsistent information regarding lack of supervision by staff. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that C1 consumed alcohol and smoked marijuana on the premises, C1 sustained injuries while in care, C1 engaged in physical altercations while in care, and that staff did not intervene while C1 was engaged in physical altercations, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.\n\nExit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was emailed to CEO Lawrence Thomas. Copies of the original signatures will be placed with the complaint file.",

SI Jackson and LPA Urena made multiple attempts to interview Client #1 (C1) however no additional information could be obtained due to C1\u2019s unknown whereabouts. Additionally, SI Jackson reviewed a police report, and other pertinent reports involving C1 to assist with the investigation process.",

C1 walked out the front door and S1 proceeded to lock C1 outside of the facility and did not allow entry from the door.

Johnson and Program Administrator Denise Samano and Executive Director Larnel Jackson on the phone. The purpose of this case management is to discuss information received during a review of facility documents and interviews conducted. LPA Valenzuela conducted a review of facility records on November and December 2021, as well as conducted interviews with witnesses. It was revealed that Administrative Staff # 1 (AS1) and Administrative Staff #2 (AS2) knowingly received fifteen First Aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) cards for personnel without having the personnel complete the training required for the First Aid and CPR cards to be considered valid. In addition, AS1 and AS2 had personnel who work directly with children, continue to work at the facility without having a current and valid First Aid and CPR card on file. Based on records review and interviews, the Department has determined that the licensee did not ensure adequate oversight and accountability was provided to the STRTP program, to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The facility is cited for violation of the STRTP Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), Version 4, Section 87063 (a)(11) Accountability. An exit interview was conducted where the citation and plan of correction was discussed with Gregory B Johnson and over telephone with Denise Samano and Larnel Jackson.

The following was discussed with the facility: \u2022 Facility Oversight \u2022 Accountability \u2022 False information \u2022 Staff Training \u2022 Operational needs Regional Manager (RM) Cook stated the reason for the meeting were concerns regarding the Board of Directors lack of oversight and accountability. RM Cook stated, based on information received, it was found the facility issued fifteen First Aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) cards for personnel without having the staff complete the entire certification process which included, video review and hands on compression training. (continued on page 2)\n\nLPA Wilson stated that the CPR, First Aid vendor was contacted, who confirmed, that in order for the CPR First aid cards to be valid, the personnel would have to complete both an online video training and an in-person hands on training. Interviews conducted by LPA Wilson and Valenzuela revealed that 15 staff were issued cards without completing the hands-on training. LPA Valenzuela expressed concerns regarding the CPR First Aid training sign in sheets submitted to the Department and personnel who signed in as having completed the training which was later revealed that some personnel had not completed the training. RM Cook asked the facility to explain the process for training. Program Administrator (PA) Denise Samano stated the CPR training consisted of a video training, and hand on compression training with an instructor. PA Samano stated that she was responsible to ensure the CPR and First Aid training was conducted and completed. RM Cook asked who was responsible to verify the personnel who signed training sign in sheets attended the video and hands on training. PA Samano stated she was responsible for setting up the training and overseeing it was completed. PA Samano stated she did not follow up to see who had completed the compression training. PA Samano stated she oversaw who attended the video training, however it is possible that some personnel did not complete the video training in its entirety. PA stated there was at least one staff person signed in to have watched the video but left early and did not watch the video entirely. Executive Director (ED) Larnel Jackson stated there will be a plan to ensure CPR cards are kept current and that they will not let this occur again. He further stated, there is \u201cno excuse\u201d for not having the cards on file. PA stated that during the CPR training she was occupied with many tasks and duties. PA Samano stated that when an administrative employee had stopped working at the facility in July 2021, she took on the responsibilities of that staff person and repeatedly stated, \u201cthere was a lot going on\u201d. San Bernardino representative Amy Guisa asked who was supporting PA Samano in her duties, as PA appeared to be overwhelmed. ED Jackson stated that PA Samano was doing her job and PA Samano kept him updated on everything regarding the facilities. ED stated that a Quality Improvement personnel left in July 2021, and after this date another personnel Ricky Chali, who is also the Child and Family Team (CFT) Facilitator and in charge of billing, is taking on the role and tasks of ensuring quality assurance/improvement. ED Jackson stated, he interviewed applicants for the quality improvement position however, he has not yet hired anyone for that role. RM Cook asked who trained Mr. Chali for the role in quality improvement? ED stated he had personally trained Mr. Chali. (continued on page 3)\n\nRM expressed concerns for lack of accountability and lack of a plan to ensure compliance with licensing regulations. RM asked the facility how the facility will resolve these concerns. ED Jackson stated that he oversees PA Samano and stated that he thought everything was being done to ensure compliance. ED Jackson stated that during the COVID 19 pandemic he did not visit the facilities. ED Jackson stated that he trusted things were being done but \u201cdid not verify\u201d. RM Cook stated that due to facility disseminating false documents to the Department the facility is being cited. Based on interview, document reviews, the facility is cited under STRTP Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), Version 4, Section 87063 (a) Accountability. The Department is requesting a written Plan of Action detailing how the board of directors will ensure that oversight of program operations and internal controls are adequate and effective for the management of the short-term residential therapeutic program pertaining to: accountability, lack of oversight by Management, administrator duties, delineation of Management responsibilities, lack of staff supervision, staff training, continuous quality improvement policies, procedures, and practices, and how operational needs of the facility will be addressed on a continuous basis. The office conference also provided the opportunity for the STRTP representatives, CCL and county representative, Amy Guisa to discuss concerns regarding placement and acceptance of youth into the STRTP. RM reminded the facility that they must demonstrate the willingness and capacity to assess and determine the appropriateness of placement within the program, consistent with the population to be served on an individualized basis for each child referred by the placing agency. At the conclusion of the conference, RM Cook thanked the facility representatives. A copy of this report, LIC 809-D was emailed to Executive Director Larnel Jackson for signature. Appeal rights were provided. Original signed report will be placed in the facility file.",

On 05/22/2022, Community Care Licensing received an incident report from the STRTP Facility. Per the incident report, on 05/19/2023, the facility reported that staff #1 (S1) did not follow correct Pro-Act restraint guidelines according to the Facility's Emergency Intervention Plan when utilizing a restraint on C1. It was reported that S1 observed C1 with C1\u2019s medication in their hand and that C1 was showing this medication to another client. It was reported that S1 instructed C1 to return the medication to S1, but that C1 refused and ran down the hallway, away from S1. S1 then called Staff 2 (S2) for assistance. It was reported that when S2 arrived to assist, C1 had their arms behind their back as S1 was trying to retrieve the medication. It was also reported that S1 had a hold of C1\u2019s arm and was advised by S2 to let go of C1\u2019s arm so that it would be easier to de-escalate C1. It was reported that Facility Manager (FM) and Administrator (AD) responded to the facility and assisted with de-escalating C1. FM advised LPA Choi that after S1 reported the incident details and admitted to grabbing and holding C1\u2019s arm instead of waiting for S2 to assist, S1 was suspended from work for grabbing and holding C1\u2019s arm. LPA was advised there was no video surveillance within the facility. Based on confidential interviews, a records review of facility documentation of the incident and the facility Emergency Intervention Plan, and an admission from S1 that they did utilize an improper use of a restraint on a client, the STRTP is being cited for violation of STRTP ILS, Personal Rights 87072(c)(11), To be free of physical...emotional, or other abuse, and from corporal or unusual punishment,...infliction of pain, humiliation, intimidation, ridicule, coercion, threat, mental abuse, or other actions of a punitive nature...This poses an immediate health, safety, or personal rights risk to the children in care.

In attendance were: Plan It Life representatives Chief Financial Officer Nyron McLean, Director Sheila McLean, Administrator Dana Taylor, and Administrator Joe Jones. Also in attendance were: Meghan Boyd, Karin Atkins, Sophia Williams, and Alain Dominique, representatives from Riverside County Department of Social Services; Rose Collins and Amy Guisa, representatives from San Bernardino County; Stephanie Hudak and Jennifer Smith, Licensing Program Managers (LPM); LaTonya Wilson, Ronnesha Fountain, and Linda Haynes, Licensing Program Analysts (LPA). The following issues were discussed: \u00b7 Staffing Plan \u00b7 Complaints \u00b7 Personal Rights \u00b7 Needs and Services Plan \u00b7 Providing Documentation to the Department In regard to the staffing plan, LPM Hudak and LPA Wilson observed various staff changes within the past year. LPM Hudak inquired about proper training for new Administrator Joe Jones. Mrs. McLean explained that Administrator Jones has Administrator knowledge as he was previously employed as an Administrator at another facility. Administrator Jones has also received training provided by Mrs. McLean and Administrator Taylor. Concerns were also brought forth regarding the LIC 500 not reflecting the correct hours the Administrators are present at the facility. Mrs. McLean explained that additional issues may arise within the facilities requiring the Administrators to work outside of the schedule provided on the LIC 500, such as concerns related to COVID-19. Mrs. McLean also stated Administrator Richards is performing a dual role at the Banning facility as the Administrator and Facility Manager. The facility has also implemented Assistant\n\nFacility Managers at each facility so that they can fulfill the facility manager role if needed. In regard to complaints and personal rights, LPM Hudak and LPM Wilson observed an increase in complaints within the past year across all four Plan It Life facilities. Multiple concerns regarding personal rights violations were discussed pertaining to staff speaking to the youth inappropriately, weekly allowance, clothing allowance, and telephone usage. Suggestions were provided such as allowing the youth to manage their own allowance money, providing more options for shopping, allowing unrestricted phone time when the youth are speaking to the Ombudsperson, Community Care Licensing (CCL), or Social Workers. Mrs. McLean mentioned that certain problematic staff are no longer employed with the corporation and additional training has been provided to staff regarding the concerns. In regard to Needs and Services Plans, it was discussed that during a recent complaint investigation, LPA Wilson observed multiple Needs and Services Plans for youth residing at the Temecula facility that had not been signed by the youth or County Social Worker. In addition, LPA observed that approximately one month prior, a separate LPA noted that multiple Needs and Services Plans were missing signatures from the youth. Mrs. McLean stated that there was some confusion regarding the various forms required from separate entities that govern the facility, however, steps have been taken to ensure all the care/treatment plans are updated and following guidelines. In regard to providing documentation to the Department, LPA Wilson voiced concerns of having to request documentation multiple times from facility staff before they are received pertaining to various complaints investigated within the past year. In addition, there are concerns that the youth\u2019s Needs and Services Plans are not being kept at the facility site to allow CCL as well as facility staff immediate access to the files. Mrs. McLean stated that measures have been taken to include these records in the youth\u2019s files. In regard to medication, concerns were discussed pertaining to medication documentation and records.

On December 14, 2023, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging that staff do not prevent the minors from having access to drugs, and that staff did not prevent a minor from fighting another minor. It was specifically reported to CCL that C1 has access to nicotine and marijuana in wax form and that C1 and other clients obtain these products out of care and use these products at the facility. It was also reported CCL that C1 was observed with a nose injury that was a result of a fight in care. During the investigation there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegation. Confidential interviews reported that C1 engages in drug use while not in care, away from the facility. Other confidential interviews stated that C1 has been in possession of drug paraphernalia in care, and that staff respond to the incidences by removing the items and following facility protocol. Other confidential interviews reported not observing C1 in possession of drugs in care but have observed C1 under the influence of a substance when returning to the facility. The statements received are inconsistent in determining if a violation of lack of supervision by facility staff is a result of C1 having access to drugs. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation and two clients refused to comment on the allegation. Regarding the allegation that staff did not prevent C1 from engaging in a fight with another minor in care. Confidential interviews provided inconsistent statements about whether the injury to C1\u2019s nose was a result of a fight due to staff not intervening. Confidential interviews indicated that there was a nose injury due to a fight at the facility. Some confidential interviews reported that the injury was not due to a fight but rather due to a skin problem and was treated in care. Other confidential interviews stated that there was no injury observed on C1\u2019s nose and that fights in care involving clients are stopped by staff in a timely manner. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegations that staff do not prevent the minors from having access to drugs, and that staff did not prevent C1 from fighting another minor, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

Additionally, a confidential witness reported to LPA that staff coordinated or attempted to coordinate hiding medication records during LPA\u2019s visit at the facility, however, LPA was unable to verify this statement. On 9/8/20, CCL also received information that the foster youth\u2019s allowance is being held in an allowance folder at the facility and that the allowance is being mismanaged by staff. Multiple confidential witnesses reported to LPA that the weekly allowance, ranging from $5-$7, has never been mismanaged or used by staff for any purpose. Confidential witnesses further reported that the allowance is kept in a binder for all the youth (FC1, FC2, FC3, FC4, FC5) and not given to the youth directly due to substance abuse issues. On 9/17/20, LPA counted the allowance and reviewed the allowance records. LPA did not observe any discrepancies with the amount of money the youth had. During additional record reviews, LPA observed that there were no signed confirmations from the County Social Workers allowing the facility to hold the youth\u2019s allowance. LPA contacted the County Social Workers of two youth placed at the facility, who stated they were not aware that the allowance is being held by the facility and not given directly to the youth. Based on confidential interviews and records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined the allegations that staff failed to maintain appropriate documentation of prescribed medication and that the facility is holding the allowance for FC1, FC2, FC3, FC4, and FC5 are substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards Chapter 7.5, Version 3, Section 87070(b)(12) Children\u2019s Records and Section 87072(d)(18) Personal Rights. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided. Note: Administrator provided authorization for staff Ebony Cherette to sign report.\n\nCCL also received information that there are not enough towels and wash cloths for the foster youth and multiple staff tried collecting money in order to purchase additional towels for the facility. Multiple confidential witnesses reported to LPA that there are always clean towels and wash cloths available for the youth. However, other confidential witnesses reported that there are times when there are no clean towels and as a result the youth are unable to shower due to morning staff leaving the laundry for night staff. On 9/17/20, LPA observed six large towels in the closet and in the bedrooms. LPA was also informed that there were eleven large towels being dried in the dryer during LPA\u2019s visit. On 9/30/20, LPA observed twenty large towels and twenty wash cloths. LPA was informed that staff recently purchased additional towels for the facility and discarded the older towels. Additionally, CCL received information that the food is expired at the facility and that the facility receives donated bread that is often molded. Confidential witnesses reported to LPA that there have not been any concerns about the food at the facility and that staff will check the expiration date of food items before it is distributed to the youth. Confidential witnesses also reported that staff will usually pick up donated bread and vegetables from a nearby church and will discard any expired foods. On 9/17/20, LPA observed two expired breads dated 6/28/20 and 9/13/20. Staff informed LPA that the breads are sometimes stored in the freezer and refrigerator for preservation. Lastly, CCL received information that the facility has two vehicles, Dodge Caravan and Hyundai Elantra, with bald tires, leaking fluid, and no air conditioning resulting in high temperatures inside of the vehicles around June 2020. S1 reported to LPA that both vehicles have a service alert system and the oils are changed regularly. Staff also reported that two new tires were placed on both vehicles recently and that the air conditioning was in disrepair inside of the Elantra Hyundai but was repaired immediately. Additional staff reported to LPA that bald tires were observed on the vehicles this year and were replaced right away. Staff further reported that the vehicles are inspected at the beginning of each shift and if any repairs are needed, a maintenance request should be submitted notifying facility managers of the repairs needed. On 9/17/20, LPA observed staff shift exchange logs which showed two separate notes from staff regarding tires needing to be replaced on the Hyundai Elantra in early June 2020. S1 informed LPA that there had not been any separate maintenance requests submitted to management in June or July 2020 regarding tires needing to be replaced. LPA reviewed additional documentation showing oil changes completed on both vehicles in early June 2020, air conditioning maintenance completed on the Hyundai Elantra in June 2020, and tires replaced on the Hyundai Elantra in July 2020 and on the Dodge Caravan in September 2020. Based on the documentation\n\nprovided to LPA, there was an approximate two-month period in between staff observing the bald tires and when the tires were actually replaced on the Hyundai vehicle, however, there were no vehicle maintenance requests submitted to management by staff in June or July 2020. Based on confidential interviews and records review, the allegations that foster youth smoke marijuana with S2 at the facility, youth are not provided with adequate towels and/or wash cloths, an adequate food supply is not being maintained at the facility, and facility vehicles are unsafe transporting youth, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were provided.

Also, the PMAR lacked the specific time the psychotropic medications are administered to C1. LPA's also observed the facility was incorrectly documenting the PMAR when C1 refused C1's psychotropic medications. The facility did not follow the directions provided on page 1 or page 2 of the PMAR for documenting refusals.

On October 27, 2020, LPA observed all clients\u2019 allowance money to be held by the facility in individual pouches in a locked safe in the staff office closet. Confidential interviews conducted with staff and clients also revealed that clients are not given their allowance or able to hold and manage their own allowance money. Confidential interviews revealed the reason for the facility holding client\u2019s allowance money was due to issues in the past with clients awoling and buying contraband however none of these issues have happened recently with current clients. Additionally, it is not noted in any client needs and services plans that clients are prohibited from possessing or managing their own cash resources. The facility is being cited for Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1, Section 88072: Personal Rights (d) (7). Per confidential interviews and record review, the facility did not ensure clients were able to possess and manage their personal allowance money, which poses a potential health, safety or personal rights risk to clients in care.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews revealed FM told the clients that they were going to go clothing allowance shopping and then FM said clients were not able to go because their homework and chores were not done. Other confidential interviews revealed the reason the clients were not able to go clothing shopping on a particular day was due to not enough staff on shift. C1 and C2 waited two days after that to go clothing shopping while, C3, C4 and C5 waited at least a week after. Confidential interviews of staff and clients revealed FM has told both staff and clients that clients cannot go allowance shopping as a consequence of clients\u2019 behavior. Confidential interviews further revealed C1, C2 and C3 have not been able to go allowance shopping for the week as a consequence of not turning in their cell phones or completing chores. Confidential interviews further revealed the clients must wait until the next weekly allowance shopping to \u201ctry again\u201d and spend their allowance. Other confidential interviews also revealed FM has also threatened to call the clients\u2019 social workers to take their phones away if they are not compliant. Additional confidential interviews revealed FM has stated to C1 that C1 must take C1\u2019s prescribed medication in order to live in the STRTP. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The department has determined the allegation that FM threatens minors in care is substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1, Regulation Section 87072 Personal Rights.

    "narrative": "On June 22, 2023, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging that due to lack of supervision minors have access to vape pens on the premises, due to lack of supervision minors engaged in inappropriate interactions while in care, due to lack of supervision minors engaged in physical altercations while in care. Regarding the allegation that due to lack of supervision minors have access to vape pens on the premises, it was revealed that clients have been in possession of vape pens while in care. Confidential interviews stated that vape pens are brought into the facility when clients are out of care, however; staff will confiscate any vape pens found by staff. Other confidential interviews denied that lack of supervision was a result of clients having access to vape pens and further maintained that staff remove drug paraphernalia from clients and involve law enforcement as needed. LPA received inconsistent information regarding whether lack of supervision was the result of clients having access to vape pens on the premises. Regarding the allegation that due to lack of supervision C2 and C6 engaged in inappropriate interactions while in care, SI Vasquez received inconsistent information to support the allegation. Although it was reported that C2 and C6 engaged in inappropriate behaviors during placement, confidential interviews denied observing inappropriate interactions between C2 and C6 in care. Other confidential interviews stated that there were ongoing behaviors between C2 and C6 that involved both clients making allegations against each other resulting in the removal of C6 from care. Records review of confidential interviews conducted by a County Social Worker Investigator revealed that there were inappropriate behaviors between C2 and C6 in care but there were also inconsistencies with the statements provided. C6 was unable to be reached for comment regarding the allegation. There were no other known witnesses to the incident. Regarding the allegation that due to lack of supervision minors engaged in physical altercations while in care, confidential interviews reported that there were multiple altercations at the facility that involved C2 and C6. Confidential interviews further stated that facility staff were responding to continuous fights among clients in care during C2\u2019s and C6\u2019s placement due to ongoing behaviors. Other confidential interviews reported that during altercations between clients\u2019 staff attempted to separate clients and involved law enforcement when the situation became escalated. (**Continued on LIC 9099 C pg 3**)\n\nConfidential interviews denied that fights were a result of lack of care and supervision by staff rather they were due to ongoing behaviors between clients in care resulting in the removal and termination of some placements. LPA received inconsistent information and there were no other known witnesses that would support staff care and supervision resulting physical altercations between C2 and C6 in care. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that due to lack of supervision minors have access to vape pens on the premises, due to lack of supervision minors engaged in inappropriate interactions while in care, due to lack of supervision minors engaged in physical altercations while in care, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights will be emailed to Clinician, Sylvia Rodriguez Smith due to technical difficulties.",

Confidential interviews reported that because of this, C2 initiated a physical altercation with C1 out of anger. Confidential interviews reported that facility staff (S3 and S4) helped to break up C1 and C2\u2019s fight. Other confidential interviews reported that C2 threw C1\u2019s clothes into a neighbor\u2019s yard. Other confidential interviews reported that C2 did not throw away C1\u2019s clothes. Confidential interviews reported that facility staff redirect clients when they try to enter another client\u2019s room without permission. Other confidential interviews reported that both clients and staff understand that they cannot prevent all incidents of clients entering another client\u2019s room without permission, but verbal and written instructions are clearly communicated to all clients. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegation that staff are not providing adequate supervision to minors may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violation. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report and appeal rights were explained and given to youth care counselor Lisa Hartung.",

    "narrative": "considered a privilege. Additional staff reported that FC1 was not denied attending the class altogether and was allowed to attend a make-up class after completing the requirements of FC1\u2019s shared living agreement with the facility. FC1 disclosed to LPA that FC1 was not able to attend the make-up class due to school obligations. LPA reviewed the needs and services plan for FC1 as well as the shared living agreement between FC1 and the facility. LPA did not observe any noted pre-conditions in order for FC1 to attend independent living classes. CCL also received information that FC1 was denied the right to call FC1\u2019s social worker and that a facility staff was heard instructing FC1 to end a telephone call with a representative from the Office of the Foster Care Ombudsperson. Confidential witnesses reported to LPA that the youth are allowed adequate use of the telephone during certain hours of the day. Other confidential witnesses reported that the youth\u2019s telephone calls are often restricted and at times denied. Confidential interviews revealed that staff (S1) instructed FC1 to end FC1\u2019s telephone conversation with a representative from the Office of the Foster Care Ombudsperson. S1 reported to LPA that the youth are limited to ten minutes on the telephone per the company\u2019s policy and that S1 has in fact prompted youth to end their telephone calls after ten minutes no matter who the youth are speaking to. LPA reviewed the facility\u2019s telephone policy which states the youth are allowed to contact CCL, the Child Abuse Hotline, and the Ombudsperson at any time. The policy also states the youth are allowed to use the phone during specified times throughout the week and are allowed a minimum of ten minutes for each telephone call. The policy further states that the youth may use the telephone outside of the specified times for special or emergency situations. Based on confidential interviews and records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined the allegations that staff failed to ensure FC1 attended a scheduled independent living class and that staff denied FC1 from telephone calls are substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards Chapter 7.5, Version 3, Section 87072(d)(8)(C) and Section 87072 (d)(11) Personal Rights. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided. This report was emailed to Dana Taylor for signature. The signed reports will be placed in the facility file.\n\nConfidential interviews further revealed that staff confiscated a pair of shorts from FC1\u2019s bedroom due to their provocative nature. Other confidential witnesses disclosed that the shorts were confiscated while FC1 was away from the facility with staff and that the youth are not always aware when and why a room search was conducted. CCL also received information that a facility staff (S2) yells at the youth all the time. Confidential witnesses reported to LPA that S2 consistently yells at the youth. However, S2 denied yelling at any of the youth. Additionally, multiple confidential witnesses reported that none of the staff yells at the youth. Confidential witnesses further reported that foster youth (FC1) has complained of S2 yelling when S2 was only trying to redirect FC1 and did not yell. Other confidential witnesses disclosed that a separate staff (S1) was observed yelling at the youth and not S2. Based on confidential interviews and conflicting statements, the allegations that FC1 was not afforded privacy while in care and that S2 yelled at FC1, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were provided. This report was emailed to Dana Taylor for signature. The original report will be placed in the facility file.",

    "narrative": "More specifically, FC1 was upset over not receiving \u201cTums\u201d because it was not an authorized medication. Therefore, FC1 walked out of the room and unexpectantly took a decorative couch pillow to the stove and lit it on fire. FC1 stood and watched the pillow catch fire and stated, \u201cI told you guys,\u201d insinuating that FC1 was going to set the home on fire. Confidential interviews revealed that the incident happened on April 5, 2021, and there was no supervision issue; the facility had six minors to two staff at that time. There was no 1:1 assigned to FC1; because FC1 was recently placed with no history. The assessment notes provided by the STRTP therapist did not reflect any violent history. A removal request was made by the STRTP the same day of the fire incident. Other confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements that FC1 had previously threatened to burn down the facility, and that no previous threats were made by FC1. Review of documents did not include a safety plan for FC1 after the alleged threats were noted. Confidential interviews reported, that no one was hurt by the hazardous fire fumes. There were only two clients in the facility at the time of the fire and the other client was in the shower at the time of the incident. Other confidential interviews revealed that FC1 was holding the pillow while it was burning emanating fumes. There were no witnesses to discern if FC1 inhaled any smoke. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegations stating that staff did not properly supervise FC1 while in care and FC1 had access to a hazardous item while in care may have occurred; however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was provided to Chiante Leonard.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews further reported that S1 instructed C2 to leave the kitchen area and when C2 didn\u2019t follow instructions, S1 then physically picked up C2 and moved C2 out of the kitchen. Confidential interviews reported that it was unknown if S1 did this in a playful manner or if S1 was genuinely upset with C2. Confidential interviews reported that there was no further escalation or incident. In regard to the allegation that staff (names not provided) did not safeguard minor's (C1) personal belongings; it was reported that C1 believed their allowance was missing and/or stolen. It was further reported that C1 had $99 dollars in February 2025 and it was $0 at the time of this received complaint. It was further reported that C1 asked for receipts to see how their money was distributed, but the facility did not provide them. Confidential interviews reported that C1 was unsure how their cash resources had decreased from $99 in February of 2025 to $0 in March of 2025. LPA obtained a copy of C1\u2019s official facility allowance log. Document review showed that there was no indication of a \u201cbeginning balance\u201d and/or and \u201cending balance\u201d as it pertained to C1\u2019s cash balance. Document review showed that an allowance was distributed every week but there was no indication on whether the client accepted the cash allowance and/or took a portion of the allowance and deposited a portion of the allowance to remain in their safeguarded cash resources. Document review indicated the facility was deficient in their record keeping process. Based on the confidential interviews and a review of pertinent documentation, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegations that staff handled minor inappropriately and staff did not safeguard minor's personal belongings are substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation for ILS 87072(c)(1) Personal Rights and ILS 87026(b) Safeguards for Cash Resources, Personal Property and Valuables (See LIC 9099D). An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report LIC 9099, the LIC 9099D and appeal rights were explained and given to Youth Care Counselor, Tanicki Wallace.\n\nConfidential interviews reported that C1 was in the process of running away from the facility and that in response, S1 physically sat on C1 to prevent them from doing so. Confidential interviews reported there was no mention of any injuries to C1. Other confidential interviews reported that neither S1 nor any other facility staff have ever physically prevented a client from running away from the facility, nor did they hear about or personally witness the described incident. LPA received inconsistent information. In regard to the allegation that staff (names not provided) made inappropriate comments towards resident (names not provided); it was reported that facility staff make statements like \u201cthey need a whooping\u201d, directed at clients (no details were provided). Confidential interviews reported that when facility staff observe clients are about to run away, they get frustrated and say, \u201cthey need a whooping.\u201d Other confidential interviews reported that when staff observe clients are about to run away, they follow facility protocol and attempt to de-escalate the client in a trauma informed manner. LPA received inconsistent information. In regard to the allegations that staff are not providing adequate food service to minors and staff did not ensure the facility had food; it was reported that the facility does not have food in the home. It was further reported that the facility serves the same meal all week. For example, if they have chicken one day, the chicken will be the meal for the entire week. Confidential interviews reported that the facility had no food in the refrigerators or pantry. Other confidential interviews reported that the facility had fully stocked refrigerators in the kitchen and garage and plenty of dry goods and snacks in the pantry. Confidential interviews reported that the facility staff prepared the same meals all in the same week. Other confidential interviews reported that the facility staff adhere to the posted menu and that staff try their best to prepare diversified meals. During inspection, LPA observed the facility\u2019s refrigerators are stocked with different foods and the facility pantry is well stocked with dry goods and snacks. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegations that staff engaged in physical altercations with minor resulting in injuries, staff made inappropriate comments towards resident, staff are not providing adequate food service to minors and staff did not ensure the facility had food may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted.

Per AM: Jalisa Chambers will be MHRS for Chestnut, and Sarah Mascardo will be MHRS and HOS for Grove. Plan, for now, is to outsource the Clinical Director position once Dr. Barnham vacates on December 29, 2023. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n\u00b7Mental health services not being rendered: per AM, no individual therapy was provided to clients between November 16 - November 26. Per AM, the newly appointed clinician, Joan Bruno, left Progress Ranch on 12/12/2023. \u00b7 Allowances: it was made clear to Progress Ranch that allowances are due to youth regardless of whether or not they partake in or complete any chores they were assigned, the frequency of the disbursements are to be at least once a month. \u00b7 Clients\u2019 personal property inventory and safeguarding: according to Progress Ranch, all of the current clients' personal property inventory have been done. \u00b7 Youth being left unsupervised due to school drop-off that was not coordinated: presently being addressed by a complaint investigation. \u00b7 General upkeep of physical plant: multiple specific items of concern were discussed and have been addressed/resolved via the complaint investigation and/or case management inspection process. \u00b7 Co-mingling of youth between the two locations: hospital/emergency packet for each client will be kept at both facilities. \u00b7 Communication issue(s): intra-organization flow of information: FS suggested that leadership remind floor staff of an open door policy in regard to being approached with concerns/issues. \u00b7 Groceries \u2013 facilities regularly run low on perishables/non-perishables: suggestion is to keep inventory and up the frequency of grocery shopping to at least 2x/week to get a better idea who/how it's being used. \u00b7 Availability of Progress Ranch personnel for Licensing and/or other agency visits: suggestion from FS--installation and utilization of Ring (or similar) doorbell. Pending exception approval regarding bunk bed set up in Chestnut will be requested for by AM.

However, there were inconsistencies in the statements regarding whether operational tasks were actually carried out in practice. Regarding mental health services personnel, based on interviews, statements from staff and youth were inconsistent on how mental health treatment as a core service was provided. Finally, though obtained statements were consistent regarding the MHRS\u2019 (Mental Health Rehabilitation Specialist) workload becoming more difficult to manage because of a shortage of personnel who held that position, the conducted interviews yielded inconsistent information about how or if the care for the children was negatively affected by this.

During the investigation LPA Turner was informed by the client in care that all staff members participated in burning the client on their stomach. The client informed LPA Turner that they were repeatedly kicked in the face and stomach. The client informed that staff members spat on them. C1 was unable to provide staff information during the investigation process. LPA Turner was informed by the administrator that permitted restraint was used by staff following the Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) plan. The permitted restraint consisted of holding the arms and seating clients in care. LPA Turner was informed that if the restraint was not working with two staff members, then a third staff member was called in to assist. It was confirmed by the administrator that staff never placed objects in a client's mouth. LPA Turner was informed that the client in care dealt with suicidal thoughts and harmed themselves on occasion. The client in care caused self-inflicted trauma to their head and staff used their hands to prevent injury. The client in care kicked and hit staff when they became upset, and staff intervened by using restraints. Lastly, LPA Turner was notified by the administrator that staff were often afraid to restrain the client in care due to accusations made by the client. The client frequently lied to get staff in trouble. LPA Turner was informed that the client went AWOL often and would advise the neighbors of alleged abuse taking place within the facility. The neighbors contacted Law Enforcement but no signs of abuse, such as marks or bruising, were documented during their investigation. LPA Turner was unable to contact former employees during the investigation process due to the above facility being closed. LPA Turner was unable to attain additional information from the reporting party after multiple attempts. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Per AM: Jalisa Chambers will be MHRS for Chestnut, and Sarah Mascardo will be MHRS and HOS for Grove. Plan, for now, is to outsource the Clinical Director position once Dr. Barnham vacates on December 29, 2023. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n\u00b7Mental health services not being rendered: per AM, no individual therapy was provided to clients between November 16 - November 26. Per AM, the newly appointed clinician, Joan Bruno, left Progress Ranch on 12/12/2023. \u00b7 Allowances: it was made clear to Progress Ranch that allowances are due to youth regardless of whether or not they partake in or complete any chores they were assigned, the frequency of the disbursements are to be at least once a month. \u00b7 Clients\u2019 personal property inventory and safeguarding: according to Progress Ranch, all of the current clients' personal property inventory have been done. \u00b7 Youth being left unsupervised due to school drop-off that was not coordinated: presently being addressed by a complaint investigation. \u00b7 General upkeep of physical plant: multiple specific items of concern were discussed and have been addressed/resolved via the complaint investigation and/or case management inspection process. \u00b7 Co-mingling of youth between the two locations: hospital/emergency packet for each client will be kept at both facilities. \u00b7 Communication issue(s): intra-organization flow of information: FS suggested that leadership remind floor staff of an open door policy in regard to being approached with concerns/issues. \u00b7 Groceries \u2013 facilities regularly run low on perishables/non-perishables: suggestion is to keep inventory and up the frequency of grocery shopping to at least 2x/week to get a better idea who/how it's being used. \u00b7 Availability of Progress Ranch personnel for Licensing and/or other agency visits: suggestion from FS--installation and utilization of Ring (or similar) doorbell. Pending exception approval regarding bunk bed set up in Chestnut will be requested for by AM.

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed, on 4/27/2020, immediately upon knowledge of claims made by C2 that Cleint #3 (C3) punched C2, tried to drown C2 in a pool and attempted to put a squirt gun \u201cup C2\u2019s birth canal,\u201d the facility filed an incident report alerting required parties and immediately conducted an internal investigation. Staffs and client were queried. The results from the inquiry determined unsubstantiated findings as there were no witnesses who either observed or witnessed interactions between C2 and C3 that would suggest inappropriate or sexual behavior. A review of facility records indicates at the time of the alleged incident, the facility was operating within approved staff to client ratios. It was further revealed at the time of the reported incident, Client #2 (alleged victim) was assigned a 1 to 1 staff for supervision for client\u2019s safety a week and a half prior since returning from a hospitalization. C2 was not without continuous supervision. Confidential interviews produced no witnesses or additional alleged victims to the abuse. Due to the need for a higher level of care, Client #2 (C2) was replaced to another facility out of state. Attempts to interview C2 was not successful during the investigation process due to C2\u2019s reluctance to speak to investigator concerning the matter. The investigation has determined that while the allegation may be valid, gathered information failed to produce corroborating evidence to support claims of sexual abuse, personal rights or neglect to C2. The finding is therefore determined unsubstantiated at this time. There were no deficiencies cited during the investigation. Exit interview conducted. A copy of this report is emailed to Ms. Bradley for signature.",

During this inspection, 6 out of 6 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 2 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 6 Direct Care Staff and 0 out of 2 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, May 16, 2023.) The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Joanna Solorio.",

During this inspection, 6 out of 6 Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 3 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 6 Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 3 youth were interviewed.(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, July 19, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, monthly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom and LPA Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. Continued on next page.\n\nContinued... LPA Windom and LPA LPA Carrillo mentioned to Administrator Solorio and Director of Residential Programs Arlene Vargas that the Board of Director Meeting Minutes provided to LPA Windom had general information regarding the review of SIRs. LPA Windom explained that The Board of Director Meeting Minutes should accurately document the review of specific SIRs involving law enforcement in the quarterly meetings. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Joanna Solorio",

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Carrillo and LPA Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Mary Krahn",

Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

The minor in care that allegedly was assaulted by staff indicated that the staff hit the minor while in the staff restroom. LPA reviewed video of two staff attempting to restrain the minor while in the staff office. The video evidence was inconclusive with regards to staff assaulting/hitting the minor. The minor involved stated that the staff did not hit him in the office but rather in the staff bathroom where there are no cameras. Other minors and staff that were interviewed either denied that the minor was hit or did not witness the alleged assault. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the above allegation occurred, therefore the above allegation is unsubstantiated. There were no deficiencies cited during this inspection.

The purpose of the visit was to inspect the fence that had been taken down due to a fire at the property adjacent to the STRTP on the south side. On July 4, 2021 the house next door had severe burn damage due to fireworks that had ignited the roof. Residents of the STRTP were not responsible for lighting the fireworks and no one at the STRTP received any injuries. As a result of the fire department needing to access the building, the fence between the properties came down. The landlord and director of the facility Jason Enger will work together to get the fence repaired as soon as possible. It is not posing an immediate risk to the safety and well being of the clients in care. LPA Bruce also took this oppurtunity to introduce the staff at JOERG to LPA Zamudio who will be their new assigned analyst. She was provided a brief tour of the facility to get acquainted with the layout. Due to printer and computer issues, this document was not prepared at the facility nor was it available to be signed.",

Staff members indicated it was not due to lack of supervision as did 2 clients; however 1 client was not available to confirm or deny and 2 others would not provide a statement.

Findings revealed that while staff was involved with another client who was causing substantial property damage, FC1 absconded out of her bedroom window unnoticed. She proceeded to climb through the unlocked bathroom window to the office. Once inside she accessed the unlocked medicine storage unit and overdosed on her own medication. Staff admitted that while the office was locked the medicine cabinet and the bathroom window were both unlocked and ultimately accessible to the client. A citation was issued for not securing medicine. For purposes of this meeting CCL is focusing on JOERG. CCL acknowledges and will honor the STRTP closure plan effective 10/4/21. As such, there will be no citations issued at this time. Acknowledging the planned closure does not negate legal action in the future or CCL's ability to consult with their legal division",

LPA was interviewing a staff member regarding a client who felt she was bullied/harassed by staff regarding her weight. In the course of the interview the staff member stated he had been told by the client that she was hurt and felt bad about the exchanges with other staff members but this particular staff member did not elevate the issue or raise any concerns with management because he did not want to betray the trust of the client. When interviewing the client who felt 'bullied', she stated that as a result of her feeling bad, she would 'cut' as a coping mechanism. The client showed LPA Bruce the recent cutting and when asked, the client admitted that she had shared with a another staff member that she had been cutting. Her perception was that nothing was done about it because no one ever checked on her. Discussion was had between LPA Bruce and Administrator Jason Enger on the importance of staff elevating concerns voiced by the clients regardless of keeping a confidence and regardless of whether they believe the client or not. In this case, staff ignoring the client's concerns did nothing to stop the bad behavior by staff and the inappropriate behavior of the client cutting as a coping mechanism. Administrator will see these concerns addressed immediately with all staff. No deficiencies cited during this case management inspection.",

This foster child is willing to have her phone forensically searched to retrieve the photos and texts. A staff member stated she had witnessed the male staff in question, slap the female foster child on the buttock and reported the inappropriate interaction to her manager. The manager relayed to LPA that he informed the Administrator who allegedly conducted an investigation and determined that it did not happen so no action was taken. When LPA asked the manager if he felt that the staff who reported the incident would have lied to him, he stated he had no reason to believe she would. In October 2020, LPA Bruce located and interviewed the foster child directly involved. She relayed to LPA Bruce that she was fearful she would be getting in trouble but wanted to tell the truth. She stated that she and the staff member had exchanged naked pictures and inappropriate text messages. This client no longer had the phone and stated she had borrowed the phone of her former roommate at the STRTP. She has blocked the staff member from her current phone and has had no contact with him since May. She refused to answer when asked if she had been coerced or threatened by the staff member.

The Foster Child now states that her phone was used by another client in care to send naked pictures to the staff member and he had reciprocated by sending pictures back.",

The requirement and necessity to report any unusual incident relating to the safety and well being of clients in care. On September 16, 2021, the foster children in the home accessed paint and did considerable damage to the property by painting obscenities on the wall and spreading paint across the walls. This incident was not reported timely or through the appropriate channels. A citation for missing this requirement will be issued at today's visit. 2. Access to dangerous items. On September 16, 2021, a foster child in the home accessed paint that was not securely stored. As a result there was considerable damage to the property. The paint was accessible because the children were in the middle of an art project when one of the children chose to vandalize the property. Although staff were available the foster child did not respond to direction or de-escalation. No citation will be issued at this time.",

As a result some of the clients were detained and some remain at the facility. The clients that have returned from the Emergency Room back to the facility have been put on Relapse Prevention Plans that include a written safety plan, individual therapy, drug treatment therapist, and a child family Specialist for skill building. The facility has created supervision planning and training to increase staff awareness with the clients, documentation, and the location of the Naloxone in case of an emergency. They have increased room searches, CFT's were conducted immediately for all youth on campus regarding Fentanyl and CFT's are conducted every 30 days to get ahead of an issue with the client. A drug prevention committee was formed that includes CD, the residential director and several therapists to discuss daily the progress with the new program and the clients. According to CD the idea is to become more proactive than reactive. No clients were interviewed during this visit due to them being in school. Nothing further to report at this time.",

Facility Staff interviewed reported that they did everything they could to provide transportation to and from school for one minor, but on multiple occasions, the minor had behaviors which made it unsafe to transport the minor. LPA reviewed multiple SIRs that documented the minor became aggressive during the 2-hour transport from the minor\u2019s school of origin. It was documented that the minor was throwing items and attacking staff during transportation. On one occasion, the minor became so aggressive, they broke the car windows and door, and tore out the center console. For a period of possibly 5 days, or up to 2 weeks, based on interviews, the facility did not transport the minor, while researching and trying out other transportation options. There were some days, the minor refused being transported. The transportation concerns were discussed, and a behavioral plan was created at a CFT meeting. The youth is currently complying with transportation without unsafe behaviors. Based on LPA\u2019s interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and appeal rights were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.",

During the investigation there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegation. Although the department received information that S1 was providing drugs to clients in care the information received is inconsistent. Confidential interviews reported that clients obtain drugs from school and deny that S1 provides drugs to clients in care. Other confidential interviews stated that clients have been observed under the influence of substances and in possession of nicotine, and marijuana, however it is not known where clients obtain the drugs. A confidential interview revealed an incident in which smoke was observed as S1 was exiting an area of the facility where clients were congregating. It was further revealed that S1(non-childcare staff) was socializing with clients in care when S1 was directed not to socialize with clients. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation or to the incident involving S1 and clients in care. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that staff provides drugs to youths while in care, may have happened or is valid but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Administrator, Stacey Rougely",

All staff interviews contain consistent information in that children are not verbally or physically abused and that children are held accountable for bad behavior. Staff stated a child(ren) may have made a false allegation(s) out of anger, or, due to a false belief that an allegation would result in getting to go home. Staff interviews reveal children are not restrained unless someone is in danger of becoming hurt or hurting someone else. Staff indicated they feel supported by their peers. As stated above, C1\u2019s and C2\u2019s whereabouts are unknown; as such, LPA did not interview those children. Based on information obtained in interviews of C4 and C5, staff do not verbally or physically abuse children and they feel safe. C5 stated a motive for making a complaint is that child(ren) believe they could get a pass home. C3 indicated he saw a child get slammed against a wall. Information in reports of interviews of C1 and C2 denote physical abuse (hitting, punching, instigating peer on peer fighting), verbal abuse and retaliation for making a complaint. It is unclear whether children were abused or if false claims were made from anger, or from a false belief that allegations would result in a child(ren) going home due to COVID-19 health and safety precautions. The evidence is inconsistent. Although the allegation may be true, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to substantiate. The allegation is therefore UNSUBSTANTIATED.

During an interview with a former staff, he admitted to verbally intimidating a client by going into his room and essentially telling him to fight him, not the other clients. The former staff also admitted to charging at a client who was being self-injurious, and the client cowering on the ground. The staff admitted to rough-housing with clients for fun and, \"brotherly love,\" but denied that he had ever physically abused anyone. This is one of the staff that was accused of going into clients' rooms and fighting them. All staff denied all claims that they have physically abused clients. Staff denied that he pushed a client down the stairs. Staff denied that they went into clients' rooms to fight them. And all staff denied having any knowledge of any staff physically abusing any client. Staff involved in the previously mentioned restraint denied holding the client inappropriately and using excessive force. 23 clients denied witnessing or experiencing physical abuse at the hands of any staff. Additionally, one staff told LPA that a previous client was directed by a staff to put other clients in check, and to fight them to keep them in line. During interviews, a client informed LPA that he was instructed by that same staff to do the same thing. The accused staff denied this happened. Based on all conflicting and contradictory information from interviews, LPA has found the allegation that staff are physically abusing clients at the facility to be UNSUBSTANTIATED, meaning that while the allegation may be valid or true, there was not enough evidence to prove that it did or did not occur.

One staff and three clients felt that a restraint conducted on one client rose to the level of physical abuse, but only by the screams the client was making and not by observing it. The client involved did not feel it was physical abuse because he was resisting. One client stated they witnessed a staff going into a client's room to fight him. LPA interviewed that client, who stated a staff did go into his room to fight him, however it ended with a hug, and they are ,\"cool.\" The client did not name that staff and did not feel it was physical abuse.",

Plans of correction for these deficiencies were due to CCL by 3/31/2021. 1. 87072(a)(6)(A): POC - Starting immediately no clothing nor shoes will be taken from clients. By POC due date of 3/31/2021, Administrator will submit her plan for preventing AWOL's in a different way. 2. 87095.00(c)(1): POC - Administrator will re-train staff on appropriate physical interventions. Administrator will tell LPA the date this training will occur on by POC due date of 3/31/2021. Administrator will submit the sign in sheet to LPA by second POC due date of 4/13/2021. 3. 87072(d)(11): POC - Administrator will meet with all staff discussed in this report and document the outcome. Administrator will also re-train all staff on personal rights. Admin will tell LPA the date for the meetings and training by POC due date 3/31/2021. By POC due date of 4/13/2021 Administrator will submit the documentation of the meetings and training sign-in sheet to LPA.\n\nLPA did not receive POCs from the facility for any of these deficiencies by the POC due date. On this date, LPA was informed of the training dates for 87095.00(c)(1) and 87072(d)(11), and received the AWOL plan for 87072(a)(6)(A). Due to misinformation given to Administrator from the Department, Administrator did not submit POCs as required. LPA will not be issuing any civil penalties on this date. Administrator was reminded that the second half of the POC for 87095.00(c)(1) and 87072(d)(11) are due tomorrow 4/13/2021, and failure to submit those will result in civil penalties.

LPA delivered the finding via Microsoft Teams video conferencing due to the current COVID-19 Pandemic. On 05/27/2021 at 1:15 PM. LPA connected with Head of Service, Gregory Brewer via Microsoft Teams and discussed the findings. Community Care Licensing (CCL) received allegations that Staff are hitting and kicking youth in care, Staff intimidate children in care, Facility has an inappropriate AWOL procedure, and Staff smoke on the facility grounds. On 03/08/21, LPA interviewed Administrator regarding the allegations and requested a copy of the AWOL procedures to be emailed to LPA. During the investigation process, LPA interviewed Administrator, Head of Service, Tracker, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, S1, S3, S4, and S5. LPA left numerous messages for Reporting party and was not successful in contacting the reporting party. Tracker stated he is called when a youth AWOLS from the facility. Tracker stated the woods are dangerous with mountain lions, bears and rattle snacks. The tracker stated, I do not carry a high-powered rifle, nor do I shoot at vehicle tires. I will follow the client and use a laser to point the way back to the facility or to assist the sheriff in finding the clients in the woods. The Tracker stated, I never get near the clients or put hands on the clients. Staff were interviewed and stated, they do not hit or punch the clients out of the sight of the cameras. Staff stated we are professional, and we don\u2019t know of anyone hitting, punching the clients. Administrator stated, she has not heard any of the clients being kicked or punched. If a staff were to hit or punch the clients, the staff would be dismissed from working at the facility. Administrator stated the staff are not allowed to smoke or drink alcohol at the facility grounds or come to work intoxicated. Head of Service stated we constantly ask the client if they feel safe at our facility. If a client doesn\u2019t feel safe, then we will continue to work the client to make sure the clients feel safe and we investigate the reasons that don't feel safe at our facility. Head of Service confirmed that there is no smoking or drinking alcohol on the premises. Refer to LIC 9099 C",

    "narrative": "LPA learned that the clients are left with one, or sometimes two, sets of clothing and have to ask for new clothes daily. The clothes clients are left with are a t-shirt, shorts, undergarments, socks, and slippers/house shoes. Two clients claimed they have had to reuse dirty clothes, however the rest of the clients either stated they did not know if clients who have AWOL'd had to reuse clothes, or that they have not had to. One staff stated sometimes it has happened that a client has had to reuse clothes. All staff interviewed confirmed that clients who have AWOL'd have their extra clothing and shoes taken away. Staff stated the reason these are taken away are so the clients will not AWOL again. One client stated staff take their clothes because they are told it is, \"a conspiracy to AWOL.\" Based on interviews, it appears the clothing is taken away for an average of two to three days and a Shift Supervisor, Unit Manager, or Program Director has to approve giving them back. In the facility's Program Statement there is no mention of this practice, and it is not approved by the Department. The facility's Positive Discipline Policies and Procedures section in the Program Statement claims that, \"there is no corporal punishment or violation of personal rights,\" however this practice is a violation of the clients' personal right to possess and use personal items, including clothing. Additionally, in the facility's Program Statement, section House Rules for Children/Nonminor Dependents, it states, \"...any limitations for clothing will be court ordered and/or approved by the CFT,\" however this is not occurring for clients who get their clothing limited when they AWOL. Therefore, LPA has found the allegation that staff inappropriately discipline minors to be SUBSTANTIATED, or true. During interviews with clients, LPA learned that 21 clients have not witnessed or experienced an inappropriate restraint at the facility. Two clients were unable to be interviewed for this allegation. One client stated he has been restrained before where it has hurt his arms, but the restraint was done for an appropriate reason. One client stated he has seen clients passing out during restraints, but did not give LPA specific details about it. Based on interviews and Incident Report reviews, on 12/14/2020, a client was restrained by three staff. The client had returned from an AWOL and staff was taking his extra clothing so he would not AWOL again. The client became agitated, and other the staff were called\n\nin to assist with the client. The staff involved wrote that the client became aggressive with verbal statements and balling his fits up, clenching his teeth. Then they state they either called for assistance first then initiated the restraint, or went straight to the restraint. At no point in the incident report does it discuss methods of de-escalation, nor evading techniques being used before the restraint was initiated. During interviews with the staff involved. One staff stated that the client had pushed another staff and that is why the restraint was initiated. This was not reflected in his write-up of the details in the Incident Report. The other two staff described the client only posturing/getting angry as the reason for restraining the client. Two staff stated that evasion was either not thought of, or not an option. When LPA asked staff if they thought to take a break, one staff stated they gave the client five minutes to get his clothes together. LPA found that methods to de-escalate the client were not used before the restraint, the staffs' actions were escalating the client, and the restraint itself further escalated the client. The restraint was not justified at the point it was initiated. The staff did not pivot or parry, two forms of evasion in the Safety Crisis Management program. The client did not want to give up the pants on his body, which is what staff were asking for when the client became escalated. The client claimed the staff took his pants off of him, however staff stated the client eventually took them off himself, and denied removing them from the client. Other clients interviewed stated they heard the client crying and screaming for the staff to stop. One client stated he saw the staff take the client's pants off of him and another client stated he saw the staff attempting to take the pants off of the client. LPA has found based on all interviews, incident reports, and Safety Crisis Management program guide that this was an inappropriate restraint as staff did not properly evade, nor de-escalate the client before restraining and their actions escalated the client, causing the restraint. Therefore LPA has found the allegation that staff inappropriately restrain minors to be SUBSTANTIATED, or true. On this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Version 3.1, Sections 87072(d)(6)(A), and 87095.00(c)(1). An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was emailed to her with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

LPA also reviewed the facility's Discipline and Runaway policy/procedures, Incident Reports, staff training records, and emergency intervention training materials. During interviews, all clients, except for three stated that as a consequence of AWOL'ing, clients' shoes and extra clothing are taken from them upon return from AWOL. Two of those three clients who did not state this, just did not know what happens upon return from AWOL. LPA learned that clients who have AWOL'd have their jackets, sweat pants, extra clothes, and shoes taken from them, including personal clothes. In general, clients have a uniform they wear to school and during free time and are allowed to wear personal clothing after nightly showers, and on weekends.",

Some staff stated that staff occasionally cuss, but not at the clients; that it might be a slip-up or accident. However, seven staff have heard other staff say--and two staff and one former staff have admitted to saying--the following: \"stay your a** in your room,\" \"don't be a b****,\" \"stop being a b****,\" \"quit acting like a b****,\" \"what the f*** are you doing,\" \"get the f*** in your room,\" \"please go to your f***ing room,\" \"f*** you\" (in both a playful and serious way), \"shut the f*** up,\" \"stay the f*** in your room,\" \"back the f*** up,\" calling a client a, \"b****,\" yelling at clients, telling each other, \"the clients are being b****es today,\" and \"f*** your dead homies.\" A staff told LPA that they have heard one staff addressing clients as, \"n***a.\" Other clients and staff told LPA that one staff (S2 - see confidential names list dated 3/30/2021) does say racially offensive comments like, \"why do only black kids put their hands in their shorts,\" \"it's not my fault black people don't make it nowhere,\" and called a client a, \" \"f***ing n****r.\" When LPA interviewed that staff, he did not deny using racial slurs, but asked instead what racial slur LPA was asking him if he used. That staff stated that he may have unintentionally said a racial slur, but he does not believe in them. The staff did deny saying, \"f***ing n****r, however. One former staff admitted to making fun of a client who had his hands constantly in his shorts as, \"gay,\" to make him feel bad. Another staff in particular (S1) was pointed out by four clients, and one staff for saying things to clients including, \"f*** your dead homies,\" \"f*** your family,\" \"f*** your hood,\" \"f*** your kids,\" and calling clients, \"b****.\" When LPA interviewed that staff he denied saying those words. The clients interviewed echoed what staff admitted to hearing from other staff, or what they have said themselves, as described above. In addition to that, one client stated a staff told him, \"it won\u2019t matter, you\u2019re still not going to be nothing, and get locked up,'\" when he wanted to get a \"green,\" week (good level). That staff denied saying that to any client, when interviewed. Based on interviews with staff and clients, with the corroborative statements and admissions made, LPA has found that the allegation that staff verbally abuse minors to be SUBSTANTIATED, or true.\n\nOn this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Version 3.1, Sections 87072(d)(11), and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Section 80078(a).

Interviews were conducted on 5/26/21, 5/28/21, 6/7/21, 6/30/21, 7/19/21, and 7/26/21. LPA attempted to interview Residents R1, R6, and R8 but they declined the interview. LPA attempted to interview Staff S10 but they did not respond to LPA\u2019s attempts at contact. During interviews with CSW and ER, they stated that Resident R1 informed them that staff had handled him roughly during a restraint. CSW and ER made consistent statements that R1 stated that staff held him down, pressing his face to the ground, were choking him out, and took his shoes off. LPA was unable to interview R1 as they declined to speak with LPA. During confidential interviews with nine residents, consistent statements were made that staff do not restrain residents roughly and do not take away their shoes during a restraint. During confidential interviews with 10 staff members, there were consistent statements indicating that staff do not restrain residents roughly or inappropriately. Three staff members made consistent statements that R1 had been combative and resisting the restraint, causing R1 to fall down on their own, but at no point did staff throw and hold R1 to the ground. Two staff members stated that by the time they reached the area where R1 had ran off to, R1\u2019s shoes were already off and they do not know how or when it occurred. All ten staff members made consistent statements that shoes are not taken away from residents during restraints. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED.

During confidential interviews, there were consistent statements made by residents that an assault did occur at the facility which lasted around 10-20 minutes before staff intervened. This altercation, which occurred in 2018, resulted in a resident suffering from a fractured cheek bone. Confidential interviews with staff revealed that one staff who was on shift the day of the incident had walked away but was not gone for more than ten minutes. Upon their return to the hallway, this staff heard noises coming from a bedroom and when they went to open the door, they observed one resident being assaulted. During staff interviews, there was also statements that during this period, the facility was understaffed and they were times that one staff would be left alone with 15 residents. Based on IB\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. The facility is cited on the attached LIC9099D under the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6 Chapter 1, section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision: The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs.

During the course of the investigation, IB interviewed the Reporting Party (RP), former and current Residents R1, R13, and R14 along with Current and Former Staff S9, S10, and S11. IB and LPA conducted joint interviews with Residents R2-R4, and Staff S1, S2, S4, and S5. LPA interviewed Residents R5, R7, R9-R12, Staff S3, and S6-S8. LPA attempted to interview Residents R6, R8, and R15 but they declined the interview. LPA attempted to interview Staff S12 but they did not respond back.

During confidential interviews with former and current residents regarding the allegation that \u201cstaff are inappropriately restraining minors,\u201d two residents made consistent statements that staff used inappropriate restraints while nine other residents made consistent statements that staff do no inappropriately restrain residents and staff do not mistreat residents. In confidential interviews with staff members, one staff stated that some staff are more aggressive with residents so that residents will listen. However, consistent statements were made from nine other staff members that residents are not inappropriately restrained nor are handcuffs used as part of the restraint. During the investigation for the allegation that \u201cStaff are providing minors with drugs\u201d, six residents (former and current) were interviewed. One resident stated that a male staff sold Marijuana to residents, a second resident stated they heard rumors of staff selling drugs but did not believe it, and a third resident stated that they did not witness staff selling drugs to residents but stated that staff \u201csometimes\u201d sold drugs to residents.

Although this LPA was not able to review the video footage culled from the security camera system because of the system\u2019s protocol that deletes messages older than a certain period, the San Bernardino County Probation Departments Investigation Report was taken into account for this CCL investigation.

Furthermore, one youth stated, though there have been no instances of staff who were present on campus not providing supervision, the facility as a whole could use more staff, in general, because of the various situations that could take place that sometimes do leave an insufficient number of staff or allow for a less-than-ideal staffing situation (female staff to monitor the youths taking showers and/or going in and out of the bedrooms, for example).

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection to the facility on 5/20/22 to discuss a serious incident that took place in the facility 5/18/2022. LPA met with Paige Woodard, Deputy Program Director to discuss the incident. LPA Hill and Ms. Woodard discussed the incident that happened at the facility on 5/18/2022 that included C1 (see LIC811 dated 5/20/2022) being beat up by a group of youth while C1 was in their room. LPA Hill, Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Ms. Woodard, Galey Betzler, ROP Compliance Director, and representatives from San Bernardino County Probation all met on 5/19/2022 to discuss the incident via video technology. During this video conference, Ms. Woodard was able to share the video of the incident where it was observed that S1 left the dorm to make a phone call, leaving that wing of the dorm unsupervised for a period of approximately four minutes. In that time, two youth were observed to enter C1's bedroom and be in C1's bedroom for a few seconds, then the youth and C1 came out of the room. It appears that while the youth are in the hallway, words were exchanged amongst all the youth. C1 eventually returned to their bedroom and a few seconds later, three youth went into C1's room while one youth stayed in the doorway watching the door that staff had exited out of. LPA Hill conducted an interview with C1 via video technology on 5/19/2022. LPA Hill interviewed S1 on 5/20/2022 while at the facility. LPA also obtained additional documentation for staff and clients while at the facility. C1's account of events revealed that they were punched, hit and kicked repeatedly by the youth during both incidents. C1 allegedly called out for staff to assist but none responded to help C1. It was also noted that C1 reported not feeling well following the incident and that C1 had a headache but refused being taken for medical assessment. C1 was not seen or assessed until 5/19/2022.\n\nLPA Hill informed Ms. Woodard that the findings of the investigation reveal that the facility was not in ratio at the time of the incident in that there were 14 youth in the dorm and only three staff. There was another staff on the facility grounds supervising four additional youth in the dining area but that still left the facility out of ratio. At the time of the incident, there were 18 youth total living in the facility and this meant that the facility was required to have five staff present but there were only four. In this hallway, it was observed via video surveillance that there was only one staff for this hallway. During the interview with S1, S1 acknowledged that they were aware that six youth were assigned this area, in that hallway and that one additional youth had come from the youth lounge that was not assigned this area. As a result of the investigation of this incident, the facility is cited for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards Version 4, 87065.5(b)(1)(C): Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios and 87072(c): Personal Rights. Staff interviews, video surveillance review, and client interview demonstrate that staff did leave the dorm unattended for approximately four minutes allowing two fights to take place in the dorm. In addition, the evidence supports that the facility was out of compliance on this night by having only three staff in the dorm with 14 youth. In addition, the personal rights of youth were violated in that youth has a right to have a safe environment in which to live. By staff leaving their area of supervision without ensuring that additional staff was there to cover, youth was not accorded these personal rights. Facility was assessed civil penalties for a violation of the same subsection within the previous 12 months. Exit interview with Ms. Woodard and documentation provided on 5/20/2022.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection to the facility on 7/21/22 at 11 AM and met with Paige Woodard, Administrator to discuss an incident. LPA Hill learned that a youth was assaulted (C1) by another youth (C2) (see LIC811 dated 7/21/22) on 6/24/22, after the youth returned to the dorm following breakfast, at approximately 7:15 AM. LPA reviewed camera footage and observed that C2 went into C1's room and a fight ensued. LPA observed that there are two staff present in the hallway - positioned at either end of the hallway. One staff was by the exit door (S2) and the other staff (S1) was near the restrooms with another youth, not involved in the incident. Review of the camera shows that S2 was standing in the hallway watching and observed C2 go into C1's room but did not react to this. S1 was seen to come down the hallway and stop in front of C1's room and observed an altercation taking place in the room between the youth. It is observed that the fight actually starts to spill into the hallways twice within seconds of one another but S2 who was standing in the hallway did not intervene. It is unclear if anything was said by S2 to stop the youth from fighting. It then appears that S1 motioned for a youth (C3) to go into the room to stop the youth fighting. C3 then emerges from the room following C2. S1 never entered the room to stop C1 and C2 from engaging or stopping the situation already in progress. Ms. Woodard states that C3, S2 and S1 were interviewed by her and it was reported that S1 did tell C3 to go in and stop the fight. As a result of review of this incident with Ms. Woodard, LPA Hill did cite the facility for 80065(j) Personnel Requirements as clients shall not be used as substitutes for required staff. During this incident, the cameras indicated that S1 told or motioned to C3 to go into C1's room to stop the fight happening in C1's bedroom. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided with appeal rights.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection on 8/18/22 at 11:30 AM and met with Paige Woodard, Deputy Program Director to discuss an incident that occurred on 4/11/22. The incident is related to a S1 (see LIC811 dated 8/18/22) supervising youth in the facility dorm and while supervising, did leave his post in the dormitory leaving all youth in his direct care and supervision unsupervised for an undisclosed amount of time, while reportedly short in duration. In the time that the youth were unsupervised, C2 was able to enter C1's room and assault C1. This incident was also reviewed by the Ms. Woodard, LPA Hill and other staff from the agency via camera review. In review of the final incident report submitted to Licensing, S1 stated that the incident was observed by S1 but investigation and camera review shows that this was not possible as S1 left the youth unsupervised in the hallway for a short time. In light of this information, LPA did request that the agency update the reports and provide them to Licensing as this information documented is not accurate. LPA advised the agency that all incident reports need to be complete and accurate before submitting them to Licensing and placing agencies. LPA Hill also discussed ratios of staff to clients during this case management inspection as well. With the varied incident investigations and complaint investigations happening in recent months, it has come to the attention of Licensing that facility staff are not adhering to the ratios required by Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), specifically one staff to every four clients. LPA Hill was leaving the facility on 5/20/22 and observed that one staff left the dormitory with six clients, in violation of this regulation. LPA did advise Ms. Woodard of this observed violation via email on 5/20/22.\n\nIn addition, while reviewing camera footage related to the various incidents in recent months, there were several occasions where staff were observed to be out of the required ratio. LPA did inform Ms. Woodard and Galey Betzler, Compliance Director during the camera reviews of the observed violations. Based on the review of footage provided and shown to LPA and information obtained during investigations related to complaints and incident reports, the facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards Section 87065.5(b)(1)(C) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios as it was observed that during the incident on 4/11/22, S1 did leave youth unsupervised; on 5/20/22 LPA Hill observed one staff leave the dormitory at approximately 6:45 PM with six youth; and there were observations noted during camera reviews with ROP staff that direct care staff were entering or exiting the dorm with five or six youth and only one staff. While S1 was provided a disciplinary report for leaving their post on 4/11/22, this and the other noted violations are violations of the same Interim Licensing Standards regulation as noted and the standards that the facility is required to adhere to ensure the health, safety and personal rights of the youth at all times while in the facility. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Woodard and documents were provided to the facility via email.",

LPA Hill advised Ms. Woodard that this investigation involved a grievance form that was received alleging that S1 \"choked out\" C1 during a restraint. LPA Hill informed Ms. Woodard that C1 was interviewed and C1 did state that they felt that they were unfairly treated by S1 during an incident where S1 restrained C1. C1 did not feel that S1 choked C1 on purpose but C1 did feel that during the one person restraint S1's arm moved to their neck area, choking C1. When LPA Hill interviewed S1, they stated that during the incident S1 didn't touch C1 any where near the neck and thereby could not have choked C1 as alleged. LPA Hill informed Ms. Woodard that the investigation is complete as there is no evidence that C1 was choked. This report concludes the investigation for this incident. There are no citations issued and the investigation is closed. LPA Hill also interviewed C2 related to another incident investigation initiated on 4/29/22 where C2 was taken to the emergency room due to a broken nose. LPA Hill reviewed incident reports previously obtained and after interviewing C2, is closing the investigation without citation as C2 indicates that this injury took place while playing basketball and denied being assaulted by another youth in care. C2 also indicated that they feel safe in the facility at this time. LPA Hill did discuss telephone use with the facility during this inspection and did remind Ms. Woodard that youth cannot be restricted from phone use nor can phone use be restricted to specific dates and/or times. LPA Hill does understand the complexity in trying to find appropriate times to meet this need given the volume of youth in care but did advise the facility to discuss and document appropriate phone times and days during Child and Family Team meetings and in the Needs and Services to ensure that no violation of personal rights occur.

While there is no corroborating evidence that S1 set up the fight between C1 and C2, S1 did leave his post for an unknown reason, leaving the youth unsupervised in this hallway. As a result of not having supervision in the immediate vicinity, C2 was able to go into C1's room and did engage C1 in a fight. This lack of supervision is addressed on a separate Case Management Inspection Report dated 8/18/22 as it is not related to the cited complaint allegation. As a result of the information obtained, documentation received, and interviews conducted there is no corroborating evidence to show that S1 set up a fight between C1 and C2. As a result, the allegation that staff violated personal rights of youth by setting up a fight between two youth is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "During this video conference, Ms. Woodard was able to share the video of the incident where it was observed that S1 left the dorm to make a phone call, leaving that wing of the dorm unsupervised for a period of approximately four minutes. In that time, it was observed that youth entered C1's room twice and subsequently reported that they had been assaulted by youth both times they entered C1's bedroom. This incident was investigated during a case management inspection conducted by LPA Hill on 5/20/2022. The allegation that facility staff did not supervise youth as required allowing minors to engage in physical fights in the facility is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited during the case management inspection for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards Version 4, 87065.5(b)(1)(C): Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios and 87072(c): Personal Rights. Staff interviews, video surveillance review and client interview demonstrate that staff did leave the dorm unattended for approximately four minutes allowing two fights to take place in the dorm. In addition, the evidence supports that the facility was out of compliance on this night by having only three staff in the dorm with 14 youth. As a result of the case management inspection citations, the facility was not cited again on this complaint. Facility was assessed civil penalties for a violation of the same subsection within the previous 12 months. Exit interview with Ms. Woodard and documentation provided on 5/20/2022.",

Facility records provided to LPA included: Client register, Staff Roster, staff applications, staff training records, staff schedules and timecards for November and December 2022 and staff contact Information. Confidential interviews were conducted with three facility staff, two clients, Deputy Director, and Executive Director. LPA was informed by the Executive Director that if a staff calls out and is unable to work their assigned shift, the facility will utilize their on-call procedure. If that fails, the facility will then pull a staff member that is trained in childcare to cover the shift. Based on inconsistent statements in interviews, observation, and record review, the LPA was unable to determine if the above allegations occurred. As a result of the investigation, the complaint finding is UNSUBSTANTIATED, meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the 9099 and appeal rights was provided to Paige Woodard, Deputy Program Director.",

Statements further revealed S1\u2019s acknowledgement of violating ROP Emancipation Home policy and procedure (Anti-Fraternization Policy) as S1 was terminated in January 2024, for admitting to having a relationship with a former resident that resulted in the birth of a child. Based on confidential interviews and documentary evidence the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is Substantiated. The facility is cited per Health and Safety Code 1558 Persons prohibited from employment; dismissal or removal.\n\nThe investigation including review of facility file/records, and confidential interviews of C1, S1, Program Manager, and contact with Department of Children and Family Services-Out of Home Care, revealed C1 resided at the facility from October 2021 to July 2022. S1 began employment with ROP Emancipation Home in March 2022 through January 2024. Information obtained from confidential interviews, revealed denial of sexual abuse by S1 towards C1. While statements disclosed confirmation of a sexual relationship between S1 and C1, statements maintain denial of C1 being underage or engaging in a sexual relationship or intimately involved while C1 resided in the facility. Confidential interviews revealed that S1 and C1 became intimately involved after C1 was discharged from the facility. Statements further contend that the intimate relationship between S1 and C1 was consensual. The Department\u2019s investigation determined, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the allegation is not supported or proven by the evidence gathered. Therefore, the allegation that S1 sexually abused C1 while at ROP Emancipation facility, is determined unsubstantiated at this time.

Moreover, staff members working on the alleged date of the incident confirm no incidents occurred. Residents corroborate denial of witnessing alleged incident and agree that staff provide continual supervision and monitoring in the facility. Client #2 denied the allegation. There were no witnesses or documentary evidence to support or prove that the allegation occurred.

At that time, staff followed procedures and AWOL Protocols were completed including, but not limited to, notifying required parties. Due to a lack of evidence, alleged lack of supervision leading to sexual abuse, and client AWOL cannot be substantiated.

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Dahl Larios observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident.

Confidential interviews revealed staff always treat foster children in care with respect. However, confidential interviews revealed staff can get agitated at foster children and they don\u2019t treat them respectfully. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Confidential interviews revealed staff do not ignore foster children, however there may be times where a foster child is argumentative and verbal redirection does not work. Staff will then listen to the foster child but will not engage in further dialogue to avoid further conflict. Confidential interviews revealed staff did not make inappropriate comments towards C1, however confidential interviews revealed that a staff member did make an inappropriate comment towards C1. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Confidential interviews revealed that staff at times do tell other foster children to ignore C1 when C1 is argumentative with staff. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 tends to try to create a hostile environment by bringing in other foster children into C1 arguments with staff. In order to deescalate an argument, staff discourage other foster children from partaking in C1\u2019s arguments with staff. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that foster children are not treated with respect by S3, and staff (S2 and S3) ignore C1, S2 and S3 made inappropriate comments towards C1, and staff (S2 and S3) encouraged other foster children to ignore C1 may have occurred; however, it is not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an announced collateral tele visit on 2/8/21 at 3:00 PM with Tracy Edwards, Administrator. This tele visit was conducted with Tracy at the administrative site located at 2560 Business Parkway, Minden Ca. LPA made this announced collateral tele visit to discuss an incident report dated 1/30/21 involving C1 and C2 (see LIC811 dated 2/8/21) and S1, S2, S3 and S4 (see LIC811 dated 2/8/21). The incident report details an assault by a client on a staff in the facility on 1/30/21. The incident report details that C1 and C2 assaulted S1 in an attempt to get contraband back from staff. LPA discussed with Ms. Edwards that when submitting the 24 hour reports, those need to be more detailed and give the LPA reviewing the report a good idea of what transpired in the facility. The report submitted was very vague and only stated that law enforcement was contacted due to the physical nature of the incident. The full report detailed the scope of the incident to be about a staff assault. LPA also discussed with Ms. Edwards that the incident reports are to be provided to the Department in one report per incident. The reports sent regarding this incident were multiple in that there were individual staff reports, a report written by the Case Manager and a law enforcement contact incident report. LPA advised that this is too many reports and that the final report to Licensing should only be one report covering what happened and not the individual staff perspective. In addition, LPA advised that when law enforcement is involved, one report on the LIC624-LE is required to be submitted to the Department. LPA informed Ms. Edwards that should additional room be needed to add the necessary detail to the report, the facility may attach additional pages to the report but that additional reports are not necessary. LPA did advise Ms. Edwards that further investigation is needed regarding this incident and that while Licensing is investigating, there should not be additional internal investigation for this incident. Exit interview conducted and document provided via email for signature and return. End of document.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced tele inspection visit with Peter Woods, Assistant Administrator on 3/5/21 at 11:00 AM to discuss the findings of the investigation related to an incident that took place on 1/30/21 at the facility involving law enforcement. This incident was self reported by the facility. LPA informed Ms. Edwards that this inspection will conclude the investigation initiated 2/8/21 which included interviews with staff S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 (see LIC811 dated 2/22/21) and youth C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 from 2/8/21 through 2/17/21. The incident being investigated happened on 1/30/21 where evidence supports that S1 conducted an unreasonable search of C1's personal belongings resulting in an assault of S1 by C1. LPA informed Ms. Edwards that the purpose of the inspection was to discuss concerns that need to be addressed as they affect the health and safety or personal rights of the youth in the facility. Some of the concerns discussed during the inspection are: Ratio - the facility did not have the required staff to client ratios required. Searches - investigation shows that the search of C1's personal property was an unwarranted search. Check-ins - Per the discussion with the administrator, staff should be checking in with staff present when arriving for shifts. Investigation shows that this did not happen when S5 arrived to the facility for S5's shift on 1/30/21. Follow up - following serious incidents, the facility should conduct reviews and debrief of incidents with the staff present to ensure that everyone acted appropriately or to see if the facility could do something different or better to mitigate incidents in the future.\n\nVideo Footage - LPA reviewed video footage of the incident during the investigation which supports the concerns related to ratios, searches, staff check-ins, follow up of incidents when they occur. LPA informed Ms. Edwards that the facility is being cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program, Interim Licensing Standards 87065.5(a)(1) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios. Review of the video camera footage, statements from the staff and youth present at the facility, S1 was alone with the youth for approximately 30 minutes which is a direct violation of the standards. LPA informed Ms. Edwards that the facility is being cited for Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program, Interim Licensing Standards 87072(d) Personal Rights as Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16001.9(a) which provides youth with the right to be free from unreasonable searches of personal belongings. Investigation shows that the search conducted of C1's property was an unreasonable search. LPA informed Ms. Edwards that the facility is being cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 80065(a) Personnel Requirements. Facility personnel shall be competent to provide the services necessary to meet individual client needs. Based on review of video footage and interviews conducted, S5 did not check in with S1 upon arrival to the facility and thus was not aware of the crisis happening in the facility. S1 and S2 did request that S5 contact for additional support and law enforcement more than three times. The response from S5 was \"You don't have to yell at me!\" rather than calling for support as needed. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Edwards and documents were provided via email for signature and return. End of report.",

The first incident discussed with Ms. Edwards is related to a report dated 7/2/21 involving C1 and S1 (see LIC811 dated 8/17/21). The incident took place at a swimming outing at Carson Valley Swim Center where S1 left their cell phone and facility vehicle keys unattended where C1 had access. C1 stole the facility vehicle and S1's phone and left the swim center. C1 was stopped by law enforcement and taken to juvenile hall. When questioned about staff discipline as a result of leaving items accessible to youth, Ms. Edwards states that there was a conversation with staff but that nothing was documented in S1's file. Ms. Edwards states that she is conducting a training with all staff regarding vehicles and will add this into the training already scheduled for 8/18/21 and shall provide proof to Licensing upon completion. The other two incidents, 7/2/21 and 7/3/21, were provided to Ms. Edwards as more informational in that additional informed was needed to be complete incidents. LPA explained that the incident reports should have a clear picture of the events leading up to, what happened during, and the resolution of/or the consequence(s) given to the youth/staff as a result of the incident(s). LPA also instructed Ms. Edwards that the incident reports should have all youth involved in the incident named in the report so as to have a clear picture of the events.

Interview with S1 (see LIC811 dated 8/17/21) on 8/17/21 demonstrates that S2 was aware of a bear leaving the property about 6:30 AM after having accessed the trash bins and caused the trash to be strung out in front of the facility and across the street. S1 states they received a text from S2 stating C1 (who is no longer residing in the facility) had taken out the trash the night prior as part of their chore and had not secured the trash bin as required to prevent wildlife from accessing the trash bin. S2 told S1 that C1 needed to clean up the trash themselves as they were at fault for it being left accessible to the bear. S2, being the newer staff, did not clean up the mess left behind by the bear until C1 woke up and was taken outside to clean up the mess, two hours later. Administrator arrived to the facility at approximately 9:30 AM to find S1 and C1 outside cleaning up the mess left by the bear, including the trash that was taken across the street.",

LPA Hill made this visit to the Administrative office location in Minden, Nevada as the youth were already on site at this location in attendance at school. LPA Hill made the visit today to conclude an investigation related to an incident that took place on 4/26/22 in the facility in which a male youth from another facility was able to enter the facility undetected. The male youth was in the facility for a couple of hours without staff knowledge. The initial inspection for this incident was conducted on 5/16/22. This report concludes the incident investigation. On 4/26/22 C1 was found to have allowed another youth from another facility into this facility in the early morning of 4/26/22. The other youth was found in the same bed with C1 at 4:00 AM. Upon further investigation of the incident at this location and the other facility, investigation shows that staff were not performing the bed checks per the company policy in that they were to observe bed checks every 15 minutes and seeing skin. Staff present at the facility on the evening of 4/25/22 to 4/26/22 did not observe that two of the youth in this facility were not in their respective beds or rooms nor did staff investigate further when noticing that there was a \"bulge\" in the bed covers that later turned out to be a male youth in the bed with C1. The male youth then went out the bedroom window and left this facility and returned to their own facility.

    "narrative": "The allegation that staff did not prohibit youth from smoking on the grounds is related to an incident that took place on June 15, 2022, where an Alpine County Sheriff responded to the facility due to a youth in care running away from the facility. Upon arrival, Sheriff located S1 who informed Sheriff that the other youth from the facility were in the rear of the facility smoking. While S1 was present and supervising youth, Sheriff indicated that S1 made no attempts to direct the youth to stop smoking or extinguish their cigarettes. Sheriff indicated that they told youth to stop smoking and youth complied, but that S1 never told the youth that smoking was prohibited on the grounds of the facility nor did S1 indicate to youth the dangers of smoking for the youth's health or the dangers of fires to the community. LPA Hill made three attempts to contact the overnight awake staff on duty, (S1), on the date of the incident and was unable to interview S1 due to S1's work/sleep hours. LPA Hill interviewed other staff that are familiar with S1 and learned that S1 is not assertive with the youth in care and is not confrontational with youth. Staff stated that S1 would rather take daily points from youth for these types of behaviors/choices rather than confront the youth and counsel them to make better choices. LPA Hill also interviewed youth present and smoking and youth denied S1 telling them that they could not smoke or to put the cigarettes out. Youth further stated that S1 never told them about the dangers in the community, including wildfires. Youth stated that they knew that they were not to smoke but that information came from other staff and not S1. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff did not prohibit youth from smoking on the grounds is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the The \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection on 7/25/23 at 9:45 AM and met with Tracy Edwards, Program Manager. The purpose of the inspection is to discuss an incident that took placed at the facility on 7/10/23, in which C1 (see LIC811 dated 7/25/23) was removed from the facility by local law enforcement and taken to juvenile hall. The report received by the agency details that there were three staff present when an altercation ensued with C1 being found to be in possession of a weapon and threatening other youth in the house with this weapon. Law enforcement was called and when C1 failed to respond to law enforcement's instruction to put the weapon down, C1 was arrested and taken to juvenile hall. LPA Hill also learned that during this incident, S1 restrained C2 during the original incident with C1 as C2 was instigating the incident with C1 and S1 was attempting to remove C2 from the area where C1 was at. LPA Hill obtained all staffs' written accounts of the incident during the inspection. LPA Hill observed that S1's description of their part in the incident and S1's account of their own behavior is not in align with the policies and procedures of the facility nor an appropriate intervention supported or taught by the agency as S1 detailed that they \"pulled [C2] from [their] shirt\" so C2 took off their shirt. S1 then \"tried to pull [them] from [their] bra\" and C2 then took off one side of their bra. S1 then grabbed C2 by the waist to pull them from the room without being able to get C2 out of the room. S1 then \"pushed [C2] with all [S1's] force\" to get C2 out of the room. S1 resigned their position with the agency. When interviewed, Ms. Edwards states that S1 had already given a resignation notice when this incident took place, but did work for two additional shifts. LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that as a result of the investigation into this incident, the facility was cited for 87095.61(a) Documentation and Reporting Requirements because regulations require that each use of manual restraints must be reported to the Department and the child's authorized representative by telephone no later than the next working day following the incident. There is no evidence that a report was submitted for the restraint, regardless of the restraint not being an agency approved restraint.",

Confidential interviews indicated youth felt that staff are not perfect but are doing a good job protecting youth during incidents that happen in the facility, redirecting youth prior to physical incidents, supporting youths' mental health goals, trying to get to know youth, and supporting youth's transition goals. Confidential interviews indicated that staff did not always know when youth were going to \"go off\" thus leading to them not always being prepared. Staff indicated that there have been times when physical interventions have not been utilized when they should have been due to prior staff injuries which has lead to escalated behaviors with youth.

Staff in the facility decided to take youth on an outing to give the youth space due to this tension. C2 was on outing restriction due to behaviors but C1 chose not to go on the outing so the on-call staff made the decision to allow C2 to attend to create space for the day. When youth returned from the outing, C2 attacked C1 while C1 was in the den speaking with C3. C4 was present when the fighting started and, knowing that S1 could not intervene, C4 stepped in to assist in separating the youth and protect C1. C2 has a history of assaulting staff and youth since being placed with the agency. The agency's policy on restraints requires two staff to engage in physical restraints. Knowing that S1 could not engage in physical restraints as necessary and knowing C2's assaultive history, the agency did not provide an additional staff on 12/9/23, knowing that there was tension between the youth in the facility. As a result of the investigation and confidential interviews conducted, the allegation that staff did not provide adequate supervision resulting in C1 being assaulted by other youth at the facility is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited for violation of Title 22 Regulation 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision as the facility has a responsibility to provide care and supervision to meet the clients' needs and the facility did not protect C1's safety while at the facility, despite knowing of the tension between the youth and knowing that staff was unable to engage as necessary in their emergency intervention plan to protect C1 as required.

LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that the incident report was not clear in the explanation as to why C1 (see LIC811 dated 2/29/24) needed to go to the hospital for medications or due to the lack of medications if medications were refilled at the facility just eight days prior. When LPA Hill inquired about this, LPA Hill was informed that due to the type of medication C1 was taking, insulin, C1 requires this medication to be refilled on a weekly basis. Staff working at the facility failed to inform the administrator that C1 was out of or running low on the necessary medications the week prior to the emergency room visit. The agency now has C1's medications set up in such a manner that the medications are on reorder weekly and should C1 run low on these essential medications, the agency now has access to reorder the medication without having to contact the doctor, causing potential delays. LPA Hill also inquired about a Health Care Plan or other additional medical support and/or documentation necessary per Interim Licensing Standards, 87075.1 Emergency Medical Assistance, Injections, and Self-Administration of Medications for this youth as, given the medical condition of this youth, there is monitoring that is required and specific dietary needs and limitations that the facility inherently agrees to by accepting the youth into their program.

    "narrative": "youth in care are left vulnerable to physical attacks by youth and the agency not proactively addressing these issues for the safety of the other youth in care and staff working at the facility. LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that the investigation and confidential interviews show that when youth are accepted and have a history of violence, whether against adults or other youth, the facility is not staffing to the need of the youth by having additional staff in the facility until they are better familiar with the youth or ensuring that staff that are properly trained and/or without restrictions or limitations on mobility are present to work with the newly admitted youth. This was evidenced by one incident on 12/9/23 where a youth was attacked in the facility by another youth and one of the two staff present was unable to engage in physical restraints due to a medical restriction. Another incident happened on 11/5/23 where a youth attacked two staff present at the facility, resulting in at least one staff being hurt. There were two additional incidents where the same youth allegedly attacked staff at the nonpublic school site, 12/7/23 and 12/12/23. Confidential interviews revealed that while staff was within ratio at the time of the incident(s), most staff expressed not feeling appropriately trained or comfortable in the emergency intervention training, confronting youth, or preventing incidents from happening. Review of the documentation received related to C1 in particular (see LIC811 dated 2/29/24) indicates that the agency knew or should have known that youth was a risk to the health and safety of the other youth in care and staff as the youth had a history of verbal aggression and physical aggression resulting in violence. In addition, following the initial attack at the facility on 11/5/23, the licensee did not increase staffing at the facility when the agency suspected that situations were escalated, as seen in the 12/9/23 incident. As a result of the information obtained, documentation received, confidential interviews conducted, the allegation that staff do not prevent the minors from engaging in physical altercations is SUBSTANTIATED as the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited under Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program, Interim Licensing Standards, Personnel Requirements, Section 87065(g) as the licensee shall employ the number of direct care staff necessary to meet the needs of children and provide adequate care and supervision, including staff needing to be able to administer discipline and setting of limits for behavior, consistent with trauma-informed standards.

LPA Hill advised Ms. Edwards and Mr. Amaral that the privacy and access to calls is an essential part of the personal rights of the youth in care and that any interference in clients' access to the phone is strictly prohibited unless there is a court order indicating that there is a need for this. In addition, any restriction related to access to the phone or issues relating to privacy must be discussed with the placement agency and documented in the Needs and Services Plan. LPA Hill did advise that the agency can use Prudent Parent Standard as it relates to phone calls if youth are exhibiting behaviors that necessitate this need, i.e., a client in care used the phone to contact an individual to come to the facility and pick them up. If the client should then leave on an unauthorized absence, when the client returns to the facility, a natural consequence for inappropriate use of the phone might be to monitor who the client is calling for a set period of time (keeping track of phone numbers dialed), with the placing agency's agreement/approval. The Prudent Parent Standard is not a blanket restriction for the time that the client remains in care of the facility but for a set amount of time, i.e., a week. The discipline for this could be progressive and discussions should be held with the placing agency each time clients break rules or violate policies set by the facility to ensure that the team is in agreement of the consequences established. In addition, the practice of not answering the phone at the facility unless a staff member is alerted or expecting a prearranged call to the facility shall cease. The placing agency, family, and other individuals involved in clients' care have the right to contact the facility to speak to youth in care as needed and this should not have to be prearranged or scheduled. No citations were issued during the inspection today. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to Ms. Edwards and Mr. Amaral.",

    "narrative": "C1 was accepted in July 2023, during the time the agency was in the process of changing psychiatrists. The facility did not have a psychiatrist for the months of September 2023 and October 2023. Prior to this transition, C1 did see the psychiatrist 8/3/23 and 8/17/23. While the agency was unable to provide monthly consultation records from a psychiatrist as required for the months of September and October 2023, they were able to provide the Department with proof of active efforts in getting the selected doctor approved from July 2023 through October 2023. The new psychiatrist started in November 2023. C1 was receiving all other mental health services offered by the agency, including individual, family, and group therapy, as well as other mental health services despite not seeing a psychiatrist during the months of September and October. Investigation also showed that C2 was accepted despite knowing C2 had a history of violence. During the six weeks C2 was in placement, from October 2023 to December 2023, there were five incidents of violence, including attacks on staff and other clients in care. Subsequent to each of these incidents, Child and Family Team meetings were called to discuss the issues and how to resolve them. The facility continued to work with the placing agency on C2\u2019s placement until December 2023 when C2 was removed from this agency. Confidential interviews conducted with the HOS and Administrator revealed that when youth are referred for placement, most of them have some kind of violence in their history and as a result, it is not an automatic denial. Administrator states that youth with violent pasts are accepted if they agree to the program and are willing to abide by the program\u2019s expectations and rules. While the facility was within ratio of one staff to three clients during these episodes, staff knew, or should have known, there was a potential for violence and the agency should have augmented staffing in the facility, but this did not happen. During one specific incident on 12/9/23, staff knew that tensions were high between youth in care but one of the staff working was on light duty and unable to restrain or assist in a manual restraint as needed. When an incident did happen between youth in care, staff was unable to physically assist to break the youth up, resulting in another youth in care getting involved and assisting staff to break up the assault. (The facility was cited for this incident and lack of appropriate supervision on 1/26/24). As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that the facility did not follow their preplacement procedures when assessing youth for placement is SUBSTANTIATED meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard has been met. The licensee has a responsibility to augment staffing levels in the facility based on identified needs, behaviors or other factors but this did not happen. The facility was cited per STRTP Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87065.5(g) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios as the facility shall increase the number of on-duty direct care staff if a child requires special care and supervision because of age, behavior or other factors. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Edwards and documentation provided including appeal rights.\n\nConfidential interviews conducted demonstrated that the agency was given a 60-day notice in June 2023 that their current psychiatrist was terminating their contracted psychiatry services as of August 2023. In July 2023, the agency found and began the process of on-boarding a new psychiatrist, but the process was lengthy, and the agency did not have the new psychiatrist on board until November 2023, meaning the youth did not have the required monthly psychiatry appointments for the months of September 2023 and October 2023. The agency was able to provide documentation including emails and correspondence between the agency's HOS, Placer County, the new contracted provider, Health Link Now, and the psychiatrist from July 2023 through November 2023, indicating that the agency was actively trying to get the new psychiatrist through the contract and on-boarding process to provide services to youth in care. In addition, in anticipation of not having the psychiatrist in time, HOS did reach out to Barton Psychiatry in South Lake Tahoe on 8/5/23 but were informed that the wait time would be until January 2024, and Washoe County (Nevada) Behavioral Health but were informed they could not provide services to the agency's youth. HOS presumed it due to the youth being California youth and not from Nevada. The new psychiatrist was providing psychiatry services to youth in care as of November 14, 2023. LPA Hill learned that during the time without psychiatry services, the agency had prepared in advanced and did have prescription refills for all youths' medications and no youth went without medications or had lapses in medications during the months of September or October. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted, and documentation received, the allegation that the facility did not provide clients in care with consultation from a psychiatrist as required for the months of September and October 2023, is UNSUBSTANTIATED as facility did employ active efforts in locating and on-boarding a replacement psychiatrist during the months of September and October 2023. This means that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that the facility did not ensure client's medical and/or mental health needs were met is related to the same allegation as stated regarding the youth having the required psychiatry consultations prescribed in regulation. When interviewing C1's social worker, it was indicated that all medical and mental health services were provided except for the psychiatry consultations as described. Social worker states that the facility did ensure that youth had consultations with doctor, dentist, and optometry as needed while at the facility and that the agency did ensure that therapy, and other mental health services were being provided during this time. As a result of this information, the allegation that the facility did not ensure medical and/or mental health needs were met is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time as the facility did employ active efforts in locating and on-boarding the new psychiatrist. This means that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Edwards and documentation was provided along with appeal rights.",

The allegation that the facility is not following their preplacement procedures when assessing youth to be accepted is related to the agency's process of assessing youths' compatibility for the facility.

LPA Hill then questioned the agency about implementation of the Needs and Services Plan as the regulations require that a signature be obtained as evidence that the placement agency agrees prior to implementation and the administrator and Head of Service both indicated that the needs of C1 and treatment for C1 was discussed on multiple occasions as C1 had high needs. The facility/agency did acknowledge that C1\u2019s soothing plan was provided to the placing agency. As a result of the interviews conducted and documentation obtained and reviewed, the allegation that staff did not follow youth\u2019s treatment plan is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited per STRTP Interim Licensing Standards Section 87068.2(g) Needs and Services Plan as the licensee shall obtain written approval from the child...and the child\u2019s authorized representative prior to implementing the child\u2019s needs and services plan. The allegation that staff speak inappropriately to youth in care is related to staff not using Trauma-Informed language when speaking with youth in the facility. Confidential interviews with staff and clients indicated that some staff would say things in a demanding tone, were rude, and argued with clients or would tell youth that they were staff, they could get away with speaking to youth in this manner or in other ways penalize youth in care for speaking up for themselves. As a result of the investigation and confidential interviews conducted, the allegation that staff speak inappropriately to youth in care is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited per STRTP Interim Licensing Standards Section 80072(c)(1) Personal Rights as the licensee shall ensure that each child...is accorded the personal rights specified in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16001.9 including the right to live in a safe, healthy, and comfortable home where they are treated with respect. Continued on LIC9099C.\n\nThe allegation that youth are unable to make private phone calls is related to the youth not being able to make calls to whomever they choose, staff listening to calls, and youth overall not having privacy during calls. During confidential interviews with youth and staff in care, it was noted that youth are not allowed to have confidential calls in that all calls must be done in the facility den, with the door open, and some staff sit at the doorway and listen to the calls, regardless of who youth is speaking to on the phone. At the conclusion of the interviews with staff and clients on 11/17/23, LPA Hill informed the agency that this practice shall cease immediately and informed the staff and agency that youth have the right to call who they want unless there is a court order restricting their calls. In addition, LPA Hill advised the agency that staff cannot monitor the calls, listen to the calls, be in the room with youth while making calls, log their phone calls, write down the phone numbers of calls made or in any way question youth about who they were calling during the designated call time allotted to youth. LPA Hill did confirm during follow up inspections and interviews that the staff are no longer monitoring youths\u2019 calls and that the phone policy is changed so that youth are afforded privacy during calls. While the alleged violation has been remedied, it was true at the time that the initial complaint investigation was filed. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, the allegation that youth are unable to make private phone calls is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited per STRTP Interim Licensing Standards Section 80072(c)(1) Personal Rights as the licensee shall ensure that each child...is accorded the personal rights specified in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16001.9 including the right to To make, send, and receive confidential telephone calls...unless prohibited by court order.

    "narrative": "facility where C1 was restrained following an assault on two staff. The agency initially reported a different length of time for the restraint than what was reported on the final incident report. The discrepancy created some confusion regarding the agency policy and restraints provided but was later clarified. Another incident that took place on 12/7/23 between C1 and S1 was reported as an unnecessary restraint in that C1 was restrained for coloring on a wall. During interviews conducted, it was reported that C1 had put their hands on S1 during a confrontation about coloring on the wall and in return, S1 put C1 in a restraint of C1\u2019s hands until another staff walked in. S1 denies placing C1 in a full restraint. LPA Hill attempted to interview C1 about this incident but C1 refused an interview twice. As a result of the confidential interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that staff conduct inappropriate restraints is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that youth is being sexually harassed is related to reports that C2 thought that new youths newly admitted were automatically dating them. C1 reported feeling uneasy about C2 coming into their room even for benign reasons, and C2 told other youth in the facility that they were dating C1. Youth in the facility reported that youth were uncomfortable around C1 to the point that the facility eventually put C2 in a room by themselves to help with this situation. While staff and clients knew about C2 tendency to approach all newly admitted youth and attempts to be romantically involved, there was no evidence that any youth in the home felt sexually harassed. As a result of the information obtained and confidential interviews conducted, the allegation that youth are being sexually harassed is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

During confidential interviews, it was revealed that during the evening program in the house with the youth, staff usually are busy trying to get chores completed, complete paperwork necessary for the shift, supervising youth, allowing phone calls, etc. and that in doing all of these things, are not constantly supervising youth in the kitchen. It was reported that it is normal to have two staff on the PM shift and that in having these two staff, one is usually doing paperwork while seated at the computer desk in the living room and the other is either upstairs supervising youth, in the den, assisting with chores, or other tasks that leave the youth frequently unsupervised in the kitchen while preparing dinner for the youth in the house. In addition, staff and youth interviews concluded that chemicals used in the cleaning of the facility are usually taken out and left accessible to youth in care until the end of the PM shift or until all chores are completed making them accessible to put in youths' food. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, it is the conclusion of CCL that the facility has demonstrated a lack of supervision that allowed these incident(s) to happen. The facility was cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, General Licensing Standards, Section 80087(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision as the licensee shall provide care and supervision that meets the needs of the clients in care. Due to a repeat violation within 12 months, an immediate civil penalty is assessed in the amount of $250 and $100 per day until the violation is corrected. See LIC421 FC.\n\nIn addition, during the investigation of these incident(s), it has come to Licensing's attention that staff were aware of some inappropriate activities happening in the facility including some of the youth exposing their buttocks while in the facility and outside of the facility during walks, youth inappropriately hitting other youth on the buttocks, in the chest area, etc. While some of these incidents were reported to Licensing, LPA Hill did find incidents regarding C3 and C4 that were not reported to Licensing as required. As a result of these incident(s) not being reported as required, the facility was cited for not reporting per per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, General Licensing Standards, Section 80061(b) Reporting Requirements.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill conducted an unannounced case management inspection on 2/5/25 at 1:30 PM and met with Tracy Edwards, Administrator, to discuss the following issues: Cell phone policy. Cell phone policy includes discussions with youth during their Child & Family Team Meetings ensuring the policy is individualized for each youth in the program. When granted, youth must agree to usage policy including not having the phone until schooling, groups, and chores are done. Calling on law enforcement. The agency says they wait 30 minutes after losing sight of youth prior to calling law enforcement to assist, but there are exceptions such as when youth are seen getting into a vehicle or if youth are assessed to be at risk then they call immediately. Educating community partners for youth. LPA discussed how the agency is working and educating community partners about youth in their facilities. Ms. Edwards states they have not had an open of communication to bridge this gap, but is open to productive dialogue in hopes of forming working partnerships for the betterment of the youth served. Ms. Edwards states the agency is open to building a foundation of support within the community to ensure the safety and acceptance of the youth served. Discharge of youth following serious incidents. Ms. Edwards states that if a child has left the facility via law enforcement, they immediately contact the placing county to alert of what has transpired. If a client is deemed unable to return due to Health and Safety concerns with other youth, this is communicated to the placing county. Ms. Edwards reiterated that according to the regulations, they are able to make that determination if they feel it is unsafe for a youth to return to the facility and they make every effort to ensure the placing county is aware of the determination. Reimbursement for Services. LPA Hill spoke to Ms. Edwards about the communication related to unpaid or outstanding services for expenditures by the home county. Ms. Edwards states they have not received any communication from the county about any outstanding expenditures. Ms. Edwards indicated if they do get notification for any outstanding or unpaid expenses, they forward communications to the placing county where those expenditures are taken care of.\n\nNight Staffing Solutions. Ms. Edwards states that they are working on solution(s) to ensure situations involving youth during the hours of 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM are handled internally. Ms. Edwards hopes to provide viable solutions in the weeks to come. Agency wants to ensure they are following regulations set by statute but also understands the resource limitation. Youth Refuse to Return. Ms. Edwards asked about what happens if youth are walking away from the facility and are refusing to return to the facility despite staff following. Ms. Edwards states they continue to follow and provide support to youth but do not call law enforcement for assistance if they are with the youth or have the youth in sight. They continue to walk with youth and give them time to de-escalate. Should law enforcement happen on scene, they try to get youth to return with staff. Ms. Edwards states staff try to talk to youth while walking, giving support, and ask youth what they need in the moment. Ms. Edwards states they just sometimes need to walk until they are ready to return. There have been situations where youth request to go to juvenile hall refusing to return so some agencies oblige youth as many are in violation of their probation by leaving without authorization. Interventions. Ms. Edwards states they are constantly speaking with youth in an attempt to get them to stay and not leave the facility. Facility staff engage with youth, remind them of the program and goals, follow them so the facility does not have to report them in violation to their placement agencies. Ms. Edwards states a training is planned that would include Managing Runaway Behavior where staff are trained on immediate interventions to de-escalate situations in an attempt to get youth to stay. Collaboration Meeting. Ms. Edwards states the agency is open to working on communication and collaboration with the local law enforcement and Probation Department to provide information about youth served and how better to collaborate and work together on a community solution to issues and solutions that would serve the community while assisting the agency in serving the youth in care. Ms. Edwards states they would greatly appreciate CCL's assistance and attendance to initiate this process with the local law enforcement. Ms. Edwards states the agency is open to bridging gaps in the community and finding viable solutions including bridging gaps in communication and collaboration in all of these identified areas. LPA Hill did request that the agency supply a cell phone policy discussed during this inspection. No citations were issued during this inspection and this document was provided.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill conducted an unannounced case management inspection on 2/18/25 at 10:15 AM and met with Tracy Edwards, Administrator. LPA Hill conducted the inspection to provide findings related to an incident that took place at the facility on 12/30/24 in which C1 and C2 (see LIC811 dated 2/18/25) assaulted S1, were involved in property destruction and theft of staff's personal belongings resulting in S1 being unable to contact law enforcement or other staff for assistance in managing criminal behaviors of youth in care. The end result of this incident being C1 and C2 were arrested and charged with multiple crimes. Confidential interviews with staff about the state of the house included staff understood youth were hyper, but neither S1 or S2 thought things in the house would escalate as they did the evening of 12/29/24 into the early morning hours of 12/30/24. In discussing the incident with staff, information provided that youth were escalated, but were starting to calm down prior to S2 leaving the evening of 12/29/24. Shortly after S2 left, S1 and S2 were texting about youths' behaviors for over an hour, but S1 did not respond to S2's final text message. S2 did not notify anyone of S1's silence and learned of the reason for S1's lack of response in the morning hours of 12/30/24. As a result of C1 and C2's destruction in the facility, assault and threat to S1's safety and life, C1 and C2 were arrested and immediately removed from the agency and prohibited from returning to the facility. As a result of this incident, the staff stated they are hyper vigilant now with the youth and have a deeper understanding of their role and dangers in working with the vulnerable youth. The agency is acutely aware of the need of the youth and are staffing the facility according to the heightened need, including having additional staff in the house as needed, having additional on-call staff, and having a roaming supervisor to assist in either facility as needed on each shift.\n\nWhile the agency was staffed below the required ratio as they only had three youth in the facility during the overnight shift, they did underestimate this situation and vulnerability of the staff. Further review of incidents and interviews with staff indicated that S1 had been struggling with supervision of C1 and C2 in the facility since at least early December 2024 but did not request additional support nor did the agency recognize the need for additional staffing until after this serious incident. LPA Hill discussed with Ms. Edwards possibly implementing a plan of evaluation of direct care staff (coach counselors) by senior coach counselors to ensure staff are meeting expectations and additional training and/or counseling can be provided prior to encountering a serious incident such as this again. Administrator states they have provided all soothing plans to be in hard copy form and in the houses for all staff to review. This would help the staff who are not familiar with new youth or even existing youth and changes to their soothing plans. The plan includes student triggers and coping skills as identified by the youth in care and worked out by their therapist. LPA Hill issued a Technical Advisory (LIC9102 AN). Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Edwards and documentation was provided.",

This meeting is being held to collaborate solutions for ongoing community grievances regarding ROP's operation of Short Term Residential Therapeutic Facilities in Alpine County. During this meeting, the following items were discussed: Alpine County District Attorney Public Nuisance - Community Care Licensing did advise the agency of Alpine County's intent to file public nuisance charges against ROP due to the number of calls for services in the county and the limited resources available to assist ROP with these calls. Management and Operations of ROP - The county's concerns for the types of children being accepted at the facility and officers walking into the facilities without knowing what they may encounter. The county was educated on the acuity of youth placed in the facilities and discussed with ROP is what the agency can do to provide collaboration with the county to mitigate some of the calls even follow up after calls. Overnight Staffing and Alternative Plans of Supervision - ROP discussed plans including floater staff between houses, additional overnight staff staying in a facility when youth exhibit escalated behaviors. Law Enforcement Meetings with ROP - The agency is open to collaborative meetings and additional collaboration and follow-up discussions following law enforcement contacts. Ambulance Billing - If CCL gathers information related to any unresolved fiscal responsibilities as indicated by Alpine County, this information will be passed along to ROP for resolution. Next steps will be for CCL to communicate with Alpine County to garner dates to be distributed for a meeting between CCL, Alpine County and ROP. End of meeting.",

S1 did not provide a written response on the Disciplinary Action and termination documents provided at the time of their dismissal. LPA Hill attempted to interview S1 during the course of this investigation but S1 did not respond to the LPA's requests for interview. LPA Hill did observe that the facility did not report this incident to the placing county, local Child Protective Services, or Community Care Licensing.

The first incident report discussed was an incident report dated 8/3/21 where C1 (see LIC811 dated 8/17/21) was on the phone and was asked to end their call but refused. As a result of the refusal, S1 unplugged the phone terminating C1's phone conversation. C1 in turn was escalated and caused damage to S1's vehicle. Law enforcement was called and C1 was arrested and removed from the program. LPA spoke with Ms. Edwards about the staff being trauma-informed and trained to de-escalate youth as this intervention was not trauma-informed. Ms. Edwards agreed to provide a reminder to all staff about being trauma-informed and how to de-escalate. This shall be sent to Licensing upon completion. The other two incidents, 7/2/21 and 7/3/21, were provided to Ms. Edwards as more informational in that additional informed was needed to be complete incidents. LPA explained that the incident reports should have a clear picture of the events leading up to, what happened during, and the resolution of/or the consequence(s) given to the youth/staff as a result of the incident(s).

During the restraint, S1 lost their footing and fell to the floor while still in the restraint with C1. LPA asked Ms. Edwards for the staff training manual for the Emergency Interventions and did review an section of the manual during the visit. Ms. Edwards states that she is going to look further in the manual for information about what staff are to do when they lose control of a situation. LPA did advise the facility that when the staff engage in restraints with the youth in care, that the restraint should cease the moment that the staff \"lose control\" of the restraint so as to prevent injury to youth and staff involved in restraints. Ms. Edwards shall also follow up with S1 regarding the incident and the reporting and inform S1 that the incident itself needs additional information and clarity as the preliminary report provided during the visit today is missing relevant information. The final report is not yet due to Licensing as the final date is 10/23/21. As a result of this, there are no citations at this time.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews revealed that S1 told numerous youth that upon completion of their program, they could return to Nevada to live with S1. Interviews revealed that there was no discussion of anything sexual but that they didn't know S1's intentions, making them feel uncomfortable at the mention of this. When staff were interviewed, they informed LPA that there was a company policy prohibiting contact with youth following their exit from the program without notification and written approval by management. Interviews revealed that S1 has not disclosed this offer to management nor had there been any written permission allowing S1 to discuss this with youth in the program. Another incident of youth not feeling comfortable was when one youth was taken into the staff room to do a hair cut and being one on one with S1 in the staff room. While youth reported that nothing happened in the staff room, company policy states the staff room as an \"off limits\" area for youth. Youth know this which made the youth feel uncomfortable since the other hair cuts being done in the home were done in the dining area. The next allegation is about S1 \"spatting water\" in youth's face during a walrus impression joke. This incident had no direct witnesses and S1 failed to provide a statement related to this incident. The final allegation that S1 threatened youth, is related to S1 telling youth that if they misbehaved or didn't do as S1 asked, S1 would get their friends in law enforcement in the area to come over and taze them. Youth also reported that S1 asked them to help S1 get information on other staff to get them fired. S1 allegedly told youth that they planted contraband in youth's possessions and took photos to provide to management to sabotage youths' program. There is no evidence any of this happened and S1 failed to provide a statement. During the course of the investigation, a youth alleged that S1 hit them with a belt one evening while in their own room and out of sight of cameras at the facility. The youth claimed to have not disclosed this happening because S1 told youth that they would not be believed. Youth also stated they were not a snitch and could handle it themselves. During interviews, another youth in the home disclosed hearing the belt strike the youth and heard the youth get upset and scream at S1 for striking them with the belt immediately after it happened. A staff also alleged that S1 bragged about striking another youth in the stomach. While there is not a significant amount of evidence in all of these allegations, the totality of the allegations and the number of recounts of the same or like information that came out as a result of the investigation demonstrates the overall character of S1. In addition to S1 not making themselves available to provide input despite the multiple attempts by LPA Hill, give preponderance to the allegations against S1.\n\nAs a result of the information disclosed and the lack of response from S1, the allegations that S1 violated youth's rights, spat in a youth's face, and threatened or intimidated youth are SUBSTANTIATED meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited for Personal Rights 87072(a)(11) as children have the right to be free physical abuse, intimidation, threat, ridicule, and coercion. On at least one occasion, S1 struck a youth in care with a belt. S1 also disclosed to a staff that they had punched a youth in the stomach. S1 intimidated and threatened youth in care to have friends in law enforcement come to the facility to taze youth to get youth to comply and behave. S1 also intimidated and threatened youth to plant contraband in their possessions to get them into trouble or to fail their program. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to the facility.",

LPA Hill made this visit to the Administrative office location in Minden, Nevada as the youth were already on site at this location in attendance at school. LPA made the case management inspection visit today to discuss the following incidents: * 1/19/22 C1 drank cleaning product in an act of self harm. C1 was hospitalized for three days as a result. C1 had asked for the cleaning product at a time when the youth were completing chores and there was no indication that C1 was going to drink the product. LPA found that staff acted appropriately and that all reports were made as required. The facility was not cited and there is no follow up for this incident. * 12/22/21 C2 left the facility undetected and went to another facility. C2 was able to gain entry to the other facility, be in the other facility for an undisclosed amount of time, and return to this facility, without staff knowing that C2 was even gone. C2 left the facility again on 12/23/21 undetected and went to the other facility where C2 was inside the facility. C2 then heard staff discussing the situation of C2 being gone from this facility. C2 left the other facility through the other client's bedroom window and went to the front of the facility and knocked asking to be let in due to the snow and cold conditions. According to Administrator, S1 was given a progressive discipline for not conducting bed checks according to the facility policy. LPA requested a copy of the discipline for S1. LPA also discussed drug testing with the agency as there was a 24 hour incident report was received about drug testing youth. LPA advised Ms. Edwards that the 24 hour reports need to give enough detail which would include their cause for and consent received in order to conduct the drug testing on youth in the program. LPA advised Ms. Edwards that without a court order for weekly/random drug testing, they cannot perform drug testing without probable cause and without the consent of the placing agency and that this information needs to be in the 24 hour reports sent to Licensing.

LPA obtained a copy of a draft incident while at the agency on 5/16/2022. This report was not sent to Licensing. When staff reviewed the cameras at the facility, it was disclosed that there were no staff supervising the youth in the living area at the time of the incident which allowed the youth the opportunity to step outside, outside of view of any cameras at the facility, and engage in the altercation. As a result of the interviews conducted and review of the cameras, the allegations that there was a lack of supervision allowing the youth to engage in a physical altercation and that the facility failed to report the incident to Licensing as required are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The allegation that a lack of supervision resulted in a youth to leave the facility undetected is related to an incident that happened on 4/26/22 in which C2 was able to leave the facility and be gone for multiple hours without staff knowing. When interviewed, C2 admits to leaving the facility around midnight on 4/26/22 but S1 failed to notice that C2 was gone until 2 AM. When the administrator reviewed the cameras for the evening of 4/25/22 to the early morning of 4/26/22, S1 failed to conduct the nightly checks according to the agency policy which requires youth to be checked on every 15 minutes and for staff to verify that they see skin when checking on youth. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that a lack of supervision resulted in a youth leaving the facility undetected and being gone for hours is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. As a result of the allegations substantiated, the facility was cited for Title 22, California Code of Regulations, General Regulations, 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision as staff failed to supervise youth appropriately to prevent an altercation that took place on 5/5/2022 between C1 and C2, out of camera view and with no staff present. In addition, staff failed to appropriately supervise youth on 4/26/22 leading to C2 being able to leave the facility undetected and being gone for approximately two hours prior to staff knowing. The facility was also cited for Title 22, California Code of Regulations, General Regulations, 80061(a) Reporting Requirements as the agency failed to report the altercation between C1 and C2 that happened on 5/5/2022.

Staff admitted to making the inappropriate comment out of anger toward the neighbors due to the perceived racial targeting. During confidential interviews, it was confirmed that S1 did make the inappropriate statements to the neighbors instead of attempting to intervene in an appropriate manner or attempting redirect the youth back to the facility without a confrontation. As a result of the confidential interviews and information received, the allegation that staff shouted racial epithets at the neighbors, is SUBSTANTIATED meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. Facility was cited for violation of Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program, Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87072(c)(10) Personal Rights as youth are to be accorded the right to dignity in their personal relationships with staff and other persons. This did not happen as the youth were subjected to an inappropriate interaction between the staff and the neighbors. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to the facility.\n\nThe allegation about the staff not supervising the youth is related to whether or not staff were supervising youth while they were walking on the street and playing ball in front of the facility. Confidential interviews were not consistent about where staff were at to supervise the youth while the youth were on the street walking and playing ball. Some of the interviews stated that the staff were not present but other interviews stated that the staff were supervising the youth from the facility driveway as they walked approximately 300 yards down the street as part of their exercise program and played ball in front of the facility. The allegation that the facility is not adhering to the good neighbor policy relates to two separate issues wherein the community members feel that the youth and staff working in the facility are not being friendly to the neighbors, not respecting the right to privacy, and being respectful of local ordinances where the facility is located. While the good neighbor policy is not addressed in Title 22 Regulations and thereby not a violation of the regulations that govern the facility, these incidents could have been addressed within the facility's Neighborhood Complaint Policy, the community members could have contacted a facility representative when these issues surfaced. Community members have expressed concern that they have brought issues to the attention of staff at the facility but the information reportedly is not being provided to the administrative staff. The facility shall provide Neighborhood Complaint Policy to neighbors/community members for future reference. As a result of the investigation conducted, confidential interviews, and other documentation received, the allegations that youth were wandering unaccompanied by staff and that the facility was not adhering to a good neighbor policy are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced annual inspection on 12/20/23 at 11:00 AM and Monica Guzman, Coach Counselor assisted with the physical plant inspection at the facility. LPA Hill toured the inside of the facility and noted that there are three, dual occupancy client rooms, one office room, and one staff room in the facility. All of the client bedrooms have the required furniture and equipment as required. LPA Hill noted that while the client beds have sheets and blankets, there are no mattress pads on any of the client beds during the inspection. LPA Hill informed Ms. Guzman that this is required and the facility will be cited for not have these as required. LPA Hill observed that the facility had the required supply of perishable and nonperishable food as required by regulation and that the house was clean and tidy. LPA Hill observed that there are two bathrooms accessible to clients in the facility and that the toilets flushed, showers worked and had hot water, and that the sinks were working and had hot water. LPA Hill did observe loofahs in the shower area and did provide an advisory to the facility about labeling them so as to ensure that all clients know what loofahs are theirs so that there is no cross contamination or cross use. LPA Hill toured the inside and outside of this facility and LPA Hill did observe that further progress is being made for the deck on the backside of the facility. LPA Hill noted that while perimeter of the facility was inspected on 12/7/23 by this analyst, the deck was and is still under construction today and there continues to be several potentially dangerous or harmful items scattered throughout the back yard related to the construction of the deck. While the back yard was deemed \"off limits\" to clients in care since the construction began, the potential for harm continues to be present and these issues continue to present a danger to clients in care. LPA Hill noted that many of the same items are still scattered throughout the back yard and not secured as previously discussed with Ms. Edwards during the 12/7/23 inspection. LPA Hill did cite for this during the annual inspection today.\n\nAfter the tour of the physical plant of the facility, LPA Hill ceased the physical plant inspection and resumed the inspection at the business office in Minden. At this location, LPA Hill conducted staff and client interviews and reviewed staff and client files. LPA Hill requested that the facility provide the following documents to be updated in the facility file: LIC308, LIC500, LIC610. LPA Hill also reminded the facility that the program statement update is due 2/2/16/24. LPA Hill did cite the facility on this date for the following: 87087.2(a) Outdoor Activity Space: The outdoor space behind the house is not safe as it was noted that there were multiple unsafe objects laying out and accessible to youth in care who have a propensity for harm to others and self. These items were left by a contractor working on the back deck of the facility. 87088(c)(2) Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment, and Supplies: LPA Hill observed that all six of the beds were lacking the mattress pads as required by this regulation. 87070(c)(2) Children's Records: LPA Hill observed during the review of the records that there are no Removal or Transfer Policy or Discipline Policy signed by the placing agency. 87068.2(f) Needs and Services Plan: LPA Hill observed that the facility is not obtaining the signature of the placing agency on the Needs and Services document or the modifications when this document is updated, changed, or modified. Exit interview was conducted and documents were provided to Ms. Edwards.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection on 1/26/24 at 1:20 PM and met with Alina Scott, Head of Service. LPA Hill informed Ms. Scott that this inspection is a conclusion of the case management inspection conducted originally conducted on 1/12/24, related to the 1/7/24 incident between C1 and C2. LPA Hill informed Ms. Scott that the investigation included collaboration with Riverside County Probation. Investigation included interviews with three staff and C2 (see LIC811 dated 1/26/24). LPA Hill attempted to interview C1 but C1 refused to discuss the incident. LPA Hill and Riverside County Probation officer reviewed camera footage of the incident while at the administrative offices for Rite of Passage on 1/17/24 and conducted interviews of staff. LPA Hill informed Ms. Scott that the investigation showed that S2 took youth on an outing where S2 admittedly did not supervise youth appropriately, causing C2 to steal an alcohol product bringing it into the facility and C1 and C2 consuming the alcohol throughout the evening. When cameras were reviewed, it showed that S1 failed to perform their duties of supervision in the facility in that S1 did not perform the 15 minute bed checks as outlined in the facility's plan of operation even though this was reported via incident report as having been done. In addition, S1 failed to provide adequate supervision of C1 and C2, knowing the youth were awake and engaging in suspicious activities. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted, and information obtained, it is clear that the facility failed to provide the supervision necessary to meet the needs of the youth in care and the facility was cited for Title 22 General Licensing Regulation 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. S2 did not supervise youth while on an outing, allowing youth time to abscond alcohol from a local store, and S1 did not ensure that youth were adequately supervised to prevent an inappropriate interaction between youth.\n\nIn addition, the incident report that was submitted about this incident included details that were not seen and do not appear to be accurate, including checking on youth every 15 minutes as articulated in the facility's program statement. In review of the program statement and policies of the facility, night staff are expected to conduct bed checks of the youth every 15 minutes and this was not done as required and outlined in the program statement. As a result, LPA Hill cited the facility for 87022.1(b)(2)(A) Program Statement as the facility is required to have and maintain a program statement that describes how the facility will serve the specified population, including interventions used to tailer their services to this specific population, i.e. the 15 minute bed checks necessary in monitoring youth while sleeping. The facility failed to follow this part of their program statement as necessary. LPA Hill also informed Ms. Scott that the licensee is required to provide staff ratios of one awake and on duty direct care staff for every three children at a minimum daily until 10:00 PM. During the interviews with staff about this incident, it was disclosed that night staff regularly arrives at 9:00 PM and that the two day staff regularly leave the facility at 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM, leaving the night staff alone with the youth in care for a period of 30 minutes when there is a requirement to have staff ratio of one staff to three clients. There were four clients in care at the time of this incident, thereby meaning that there needed to be two staff awake and on duty until 10:00 PM. When interviewed, staff stated it was regular to leave before 10:00 PM. The facility was also cited for 87065.5(a)(1) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios as the facility is required to have one awake and on duty direct care staff for every three children, or fraction thereof, present, at a minimum and this was not being done. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to the facility along with appeal rights.",

    "narrative": "current psychiatrist was terminating their contracted psychiatry services as of August 2023. In July 2023, the agency found and began the process of on-boarding a new psychiatrist, but the process was lengthy, and the agency did not have the new psychiatrist on board until November 2023, meaning the youth did not have the required monthly psychiatry consultations for the months of September 2023 and October 2023 but the agency continued to accept youth, specifically, C1 (see LIC811 dated 3/25/24) was admitted 10/23/23. The agency was able to provide documentation including emails and correspondence between the agency's HOS, Placer County, the new contracted provider, Health Link Now, and the psychiatrist from July 2023 through November 2023, indicating that the agency was actively trying to get the new psychiatrist through the contract and on boarding process to provide services to youth in care. In addition, in anticipation of not having the psychiatrist on board in time, Head of Service (HOS) did reach out to Barton Psychiatry in South Lake Tahoe on 8/5/23 but were informed that the wait time would be until January 2024, and Washoe County (Nevada) Behavioral Health informed the agency that they could not provide services to the agency's youth. HOS presumed this was due to the youth being California youth and not from Nevada. The new psychiatrist was providing psychiatry services to youth in care as of November 14, 2023. LPA Hill was informed that during the time with no psychiatry services, the agency had prepared in advanced and did have prescription refills for all youths' medications and no youth went without medications or had lapses in medications during the months of September 2023 or October 2023. The allegation that the facility did not ensure client's medical and/or mental health needs were met is related to the same allegation as stated regarding youth having the required psychiatry consultations prescribed in regulation. When reviewing C2 and C3's paperwork, it was indicated that all medical and mental health services were provided except for the psychiatry consultations as described. C1 was admitted in the facility and did have the required psychiatry appointments as required as they were part of C1\u2019s negotiated services with the placement agency. Interviews indicate that the facility did ensure all youth had consultations with doctor, dentist, and optometry as needed while at the facility and that the agency did ensure that therapy, and other mental health services were being provided during youths\u2019 time at the facility. As a result of the investigation, documentation received, interviews conducted, the allegations that the facility did not provide clients in care with consultation from a psychiatrist as required and that the facility did not ensure medical and/or mental health needs were met is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time as the facility did employ active efforts in locating and on boarding the new psychiatrist and were providing other mental health services to youth in care. Unsubstantiated means that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview conducted with Ms. Scott and documentation provided, including appeal rights.",

The inspection on this date was made for the purposes of discussing two incident reports regarding youths C1, C2, and C3. The details of the incidents are as follows: 11/12/24 - C1 and C2 collaborated in the taking of an educational staff's phone. C2 was arrested and charged with theft after review of the classroom cameras showed C2 taking the phone. C2 was returned to the program and remains in program at this time. LPA Hill interviewed one staff and one youth related to this incident. One youth was not available to interview due to absconding from the facility and not returning.

LPA Hill observed that the facility has three dual occupancy bedrooms for clients in care but each of the youth currently are not sharing bedrooms with other youth. LPA Hill observed that the facility was clean, safe and sanitary during the annual inspection. LPA Hill observed that the smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors were functioning as required. Fire extinguishers were last inspected 1/23/24. LPA Hill observed two client restrooms that had running hot water, paper towels, flushing toilets, and showers that delivered hot water. LPA Hill observed that the client bedrooms were supplied with proper bedding including mattress cover, fitted sheets, blankets, pillows, closet space, and storage for belongings. LPA Hill observed that the facility had two days perishable food supply and seven days nonperishable food supply appropriate for the youth in care. LPA Hill observed the facility was safe inside and out for youth in care. The deck is new and was very stable and no concerns were noted on the perimeter of the facility. LPA Hill interviewed one youth while at the house as that youth was home sick and not attending school on this date. LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that the client interviews were going to be conducted at the agency administrative offices as well as file reviews. LPA Hill interviewed two youth at the administrative office. Document was provided to Ms. Edwards and exit interview was conducted.",

LPA Hill spoke with Ms. Edwards regarding an incident that occurred on 12/9/24 in which C1 (see LIC811 dated 12/20/24) disclosed an inappropriate sexual contact with C2 at the facility, the evening of 12/8/24. Ms. Edwards states that an internal investigation was conducted and it was discovered that staff on duty, S1, did not conduct the evening bed checks as required. (Internal investigation was obtained) LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that the agency is cited for 87078(b) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision as the licensee shall provide those services identified in each child\u2019s...needs and services plan...including the need for bed checks of every 15 minutes as described in the Licensee's Program Plan. This was not done which left youth unsupervised and not monitored, leading to the inappropriate interaction between C1 and C2. LPA Hill also discussed with the agency changes in the intake procedures for the better assessment of youth being admitted into the facility and how the agency is looking to lower the incidents of calling on law enforcement partners. LPA Hill discussed that calls for law enforcement services has risen in comparison to previous years and requested that the agency provide a written assessment and training plan to address this rise in calls. LPA Hill is requesting that the agency assess how they can work with staff and agency management to mitigate the need for these calls. LPA Hill advised that it is imperative that the agency try to work with staff and local partners to reduce these calls for service. LPA Hill requested that the agency provide updated written intake procedures, update of the Neighborhood Complaint Procedures, and any/all procedures on how staff and management can mitigate the calls for service to Law Enforcement partners in the community.

When it was finally decided to assign all youth to S2 and begin their transition, S2 noted that there were three to four weeks' of missing or undone therapy documentation to facilitate this change in therapists. S2 noted that in discussing this with the agency's management, S2 was directed to \"start new\" with all of the youth being added to S2's caseload, which was about half of all the youth they had in care at that time. S2 indicates that this meant going back and completing documents for all youth as if they were brand new, even if they had been in care for some time, as there were incomplete and/or undone documented therapy notes.

C1 had a visitation scheduled at the school site with another family member on 8/31/24, where C1 was going to ask that family member for a ride back to the family's home. The agency made tentative alternate plans to provide the transportation for the youth to the family's home on 9/3/24, if the family member did not agree to provide that transportation. During the investigation, it was discovered that staff did not communicate discharge plans, including the family member transporting C1 from the program, with C1's parent/guardian to ensure that C1 had a place to stay upon arrival. Further confidential interviews indicate that the relationship between C1 and their parent/guardian was \"difficult\", and staff did not verify that this was an appropriate plan for C1 at the time of their discharge. As a result of the lack of an appropriate discharge plan, C1 left the facility on an unauthorized absence and when law enforcement was called and subsequently arrived, they provided transportation to C1 to a public location where C1 was left.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill conducted an unannounced case management inspection on 2/5/25 at 1:30 PM and met with Tracy Edwards, Administrator, to discuss the following issues: Cell phone policy. Cell phone policy includes discussions with youth during their Child & Family Team Meetings ensuring the policy is individualized for each youth in the program. When granted, youth must agree to usage policy including not having the phone until schooling, groups, and chores are done. Calling on law enforcement. The agency says they wait 30 minutes after losing sight of youth prior to calling law enforcement to assist, but there are exceptions such as when youth are seen getting into a vehicle or if youth are assessed to be at risk then they call immediately. Educating community partners for youth. LPA discussed how the agency is working and educating community partners about youth in their facilities. Ms. Edwards states they have not had an open of communication to bridge this gap, but is open to productive dialogue in hopes of forming working partnerships for the betterment of the youth served. Ms. Edwards states the agency is open to building a foundation of support within the community to ensure the safety and acceptance of the youth served. Discharge of youth following serious incidents. Ms. Edwards states that if a child has left the facility via law enforcement, they immediately contact the placing county to alert of what has transpired. If a client is deemed unable to return due to Health and Safety concerns with other youth, this is communicated to the placing county. Ms. Edwards reiterated that according to the regulations, they are able to make that determination if they feel it is unsafe for a youth to return to the facility and they make every effort to ensure the placing county is aware of the determination. Reimbursement for Services. LPA Hill spoke to Ms. Edwards about the communication related to unpaid or outstanding services for expenditures by the home county. Ms. Edwards states they have not received any communication from the county about any outstanding expenditures. Ms. Edwards indicated if they do get notification for any outstanding or unpaid expenses, they forward communications to the placing county where those expenditures are taken care of.\n\nNight Staffing Solutions. Ms. Edwards states that they are working on solution(s) to ensure situations involving youth during the hours of 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM are handled internally. Ms. Edwards hopes to provide viable solutions in the weeks to come. Agency wants to ensure they are following regulations set by statute but also understands the resource limitation. Youth Refuse to Return. Ms. Edwards asked about what happens if youth are walking away from the facility and are refusing to return to the facility despite staff following. Ms. Edwards states they continue to follow and provide support to youth but do not call law enforcement for assistance if they are with the youth or have the youth in sight. They continue to walk with youth and give them time to de-escalate. Should law enforcement happen on scene, they try to get youth to return with staff. Ms. Edwards states staff try to talk to youth while walking, giving support, and ask youth what they need in the moment. Ms. Edwards states they just sometimes need to walk until they are ready to return. There have been situations where youth request to go to juvenile hall refusing to return so some agencies oblige youth as many are in violation of their probation by leaving without authorization. Interventions. Ms. Edwards states they are constantly speaking with youth in an attempt to get them to stay and not leave the facility. Facility staff engage with youth, remind them of the program and goals, follow them so the facility does not have to report them in violation to their placement agencies. Ms. Edwards states a training is planned that would include Managing Runaway Behavior where staff are trained on immediate interventions to de-escalate situations in an attempt to get youth to stay. Collaboration Meeting. Ms. Edwards states the agency is open to working on communication and collaboration with the local law enforcement and Probation Department to provide information about youth served and how better to collaborate and work together on a community solution to issues and solutions that would serve the community while assisting the agency in serving the youth in care. Ms. Edwards states they would greatly appreciate CCL's assistance and attendance to initiate this process with the local law enforcement. Ms. Edwards states the agency is open to bridging gaps in the community and finding viable solutions including bridging gaps in communication and collaboration in all of these identified areas. LPA Hill did request that the agency supply a cell phone policy discussed during this inspection. No citations were issued during this inspection and this document was provided.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill conducted an unannounced case management inspection on 2/18/25 at 10:15 AM and met with Tracy Edwards, Administrator. LPA Hill conducted the inspection to provide findings related to an incident that took place on 11/17/24 in which it was alleged that S1 (see LIC811 dated 2/18/25) provided C1 a ride away from the facility as S1 was leaving the facility at the end of their shift. Investigation showed that S1 was the overnight staff working at the facility and was set to leave at 8:00 AM. S1 and the youth in care were awake and getting ready to begin the morning chores when C1 left the facility through their bedroom window and was able to access S1's running and unlocked vehicle. S1's vehicle was on and warming while S1 was inside, not supervising the unlocked vehicle. During this time, C1 was able to get into S1's vehicle and leave the facility with C1 in their vehicle. During an interview with S1, S1 denied planning to leave their vehicle on and unattended to allow C1 to get into their vehicle and take them away from the facility. S1 did admit they did not check their vehicle prior to leaving the facility property, even though they were aware of C1's unauthorized absence. S1 admitted they drove into the nearby town to get an energy drink. S1 noted when returning to their vehicle, items in the back of their vehicle were disturbed. S1 confirmed they suspected C1 was in their vehicle due to the disturbed items, but failed to notify the facility staff or the police of their suspicions until they were contacted by the sheriff's office. An interview with C2 indicates they were present during the conversation between C1 and S1 about C1 leaving the facility and S1 providing the transportation into town as it occurred. In discussion with the administrator, the agency does have a training specifically about not leaving any vehicles unattended and LPA obtained a copy of this training module while at the agency. While there is a training indicating this, S1 failed to follow the training. LPA Hill did provide an advisory to the agency to have this policy included in the agency's Vehicle Safety Policy (see attached Technical Advisory, LIC9102 AN). This concludes the investigation of this matter at this time. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to Ms. Edwards.",

During this meeting, the following items were discussed: Alpine County District Attorney Public Nuisance - Community Care Licensing did advise the agency of Alpine County's intent to file public nuisance charges against ROP due to the number of calls for services in the county and the limited resources available to assist ROP with these calls. Management and Operations of ROP - The county's concerns for the types of children being accepted at the facility and officers walking into the facilities without knowing what they may encounter. The county was educated on the acuity of youth placed in the facilities and discussed with ROP is what the agency can do to provide collaboration with the county to mitigate some of the calls even follow up after calls. Overnight Staffing and Alternative Plans of Supervision - ROP discussed plans including floater staff between houses, additional overnight staff staying in a facility when youth exhibit escalated behaviors. Law Enforcement Meetings with ROP - The agency is open to collaborative meetings and additional collaboration and follow-up discussions following law enforcement contacts. Ambulance Billing - If CCL gathers information related to any unresolved fiscal responsibilities as indicated by Alpine County, this information will be passed along to ROP for resolution.

Staff reported that while C1 was challenging to get up and motivated, C1 was in the restroom with another youth getting ready with the door closed and locked. S1 knocked on the door of the restroom to request that the door be opened as the youth are prohibited to have more than one in the restroom at a time. When youth failed to open the door, S1 allegedly continued to knock and bang on the door to get youth out of the restroom. C1 opened the door swinging and struck S1 in the face. It was alleged that S1 hit C1 back and attempted to restrain C1 during this interaction. Immediately following the interaction, S1 called law enforcement and reported they had been assaulted in the facility. Confidential interviews of staff and youth in care revealed that while C1 was frequently a challenge both physically and verbally towards staff and other youth in care, C1 seemed to \"bump heads\" more with S1 than other staff in the facility. Staff indicated that S1 was typically sweet but S1 was unable to maintain their own composure at times making things harder in the facility with the youth. Staff indicated that when they observed that S1 was struggling with C1, they would step in to assist in diffusing situation(s). Staff admitted that while this didn't happen all the time, it was frequent enough that staff knew to watch for this during their shifts with S1 in the facility, and particularly when S1 worked with C1. Staff reported they did not feel that S1 was abusive but did feel that S1's inability to be trauma informed or with this population ultimately lead to S1 leaving the agency after this incident. As a result of the investigation, documentation received, and interviews conducted, the allegations that facility staff handle minors in a rough manner and that staff do not speak to minors with dignity and respect are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met.

The incident report details that C1 was administered a five panel drug screening as a result of returning from a home pass and this report details that it is in accordance with the \"standard protocol for all clients after home visits\". LPA Hill advised the agency that this could be perceived as an unnecessary search as just because a youth is returning from a home visit is not sufficient to render it probable cause for such searches. LPA Hill advised that in the absence of a court order explicitly stating that drug testing is required for such events for each youth in care, the agency cannot do this. LPA Hill stressed that this must be by court order and not as ordered by the youths' probation officers. Furthermore, this practice is not in the Program Statement for the agency and cannot be implemented without approval from Licensing. LPA Hill did provide the agency with an Advisory Note - Technical Violation related to Personal Rights and unreasonable searches. LPA Hill also discussed an incident report dated 6/14/25 where C2 was able to abscond from the facility without detection either 6/13/25 or early morning hours of 6/14/25. The incident report details that S1 did not complete the required 15 minute bed checks in that S1 failed to ensure that when conducting a bed check they were seeing skin. As a result, C2 was reported absent from the facility on 6/14/25 from an unknown time and returned 6/15/25 in the evening hours. LPA Hill obtained S1's disciplinary for not performing the appropriate bed checks. Exit interview conducted and documents provided.",

C1 claims that in feeling this inappropriate touch and gesture, C1 jumped out of bed upset angry and did attack C2 as a result. C2 alleges that C1 attacked him after engaging in a discussion in the bedroom with C1 and C3 and that the attack was not provoked. While there is a not a dispute about the fight happening between C1 and C2. The allegation is related to a lack of supervision which allowed C2 to be in C1's room for the period of time resulting in the inappropriate contact. The facility documented that when the cameras were reviewed, C2 was observed to have gone into C1's room and be in that room for 22 minutes before staff responded to the room, due to the fight. When interviewed, Program Administrator states that the night shift is to conduct bedroom checks every 15 minutes but to vary their bedroom checks between 10 to 15 minutes so as to not be predictable for the youth. In this case, the Night Watch Log obtained for this night show that bed checks were done ever 15 minutes on the nose which the facility documented elsewhere to not be true since video footage shows that C2 was able to leave his own room and be in C1's room for 22 minutes which is more than the documented 15 minute bed checks.

LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that the purpose of the inspection was to discuss a program design addendum regarding overnight staffing that was sent to LPA Hill on 5/28/23. The addendum from the agency outlines that this facility will not have an awake night staff person but would have a staff person present at the facility sleeping while the three youth sleep. LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that the regulations for Short Term Residential Therapeutic Programs (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) requires \"During the hours of 10 pm to 7 am, there shall be one awake and on duty direct care staff for every six children, or fraction thereof, present, at a minimum. [86065.5]\" This means that the Department cannot accept this addendum and the facility shall provide the awake night staff as required. Further discussing, Ms. Edwards requested an exception for the three youth currently present in the facility to not have the awake night staff as required as the youth have completed their requirements as STRTP clients and are awaiting AB 12 transition and/or transitional housing acceptance. LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that an exception would need to be in writing and submitted to the Department for review/approval. LPA Hill informed Ms. Edwards that if they would like to proceed, they can submit the required written documentation to the Department for review. Ms. Edwards stated that she would work on the necessary paperwork this week to get it to the Department for review. End of inspection.",

The incident report details that C1 received a probation visit on 6/18/25 where C1 was drug tested by the probation officer. C1 tested positive for a substance(s) that are prohibited which prompted the probation officer to then search C1's bedroom, finding another prohibited item(s). As a result of the drug test and contraband found in C1's possession, C2 and C3 were also tested and their rooms searched. When discussing this incident with Ms. Edwards, LPA Hill advised the agency to be careful as this may be perceived as an unnecessary search of C2 and C3's persons simply because they share the house with C1. LPA Hill advised that there did not seem to be any behavior(s) that prompted C2 or C3 to be tested or their rooms searched nor was it documented that approval from their placing agency was obtained prior to conducting said drug testing or rooms search(es). Ms. Edwards stated that permission was obtained from the placing agencies for C2 and C3, for the drug testing and the room searches, but did not document it on the incident report. In addition to this, it is noted on the incident report that the agency will \"continue to randomly drug test all three [youth]\". LPA Hill advised that without a court order explicitly stating that random drug testing is required, the agency cannot do this. LPA Hill stressed that this must be by court order and not as ordered by the youths' probation officers. LPA Hill did provide the agency with an Advisory Note - Technical Violation related to Personal Rights and unreasonable searches. Exit interview conducted and documents provided.",
