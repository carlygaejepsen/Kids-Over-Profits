Confidential statements revealed admission to not contacting the police as it was believed they would not take action due to C2 being a juvenile. Licensee ultimately requested to have C2 removed from the facility. The investigation revealed licensee was unable to provide the necessary care and supervision solely, leading to multiple incidents of C2 physically assaulting C1. Based on confidential statements and documentary evidence, the allegation claiming Licensee\u2019s neglect and/or lack of supervision led to resident being physically abused by another resident while in care is substantiated. This action poses an immediate health, safety, and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. Facility cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, Chapter 4 regulation 83078(a)(1) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision.

    "narrative": "At 1PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont met with the home above over Microsoft Teams to conduct an Regional Office Meeting. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the home's request for an age exception for one of their clients in care, as well as to discuss the home's plans to submit an application to transition to an Adult Residential Facility. LPA met with Licensee/Administrator Raphael Yambao, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance were Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong, East Bay Regional Center (RCEB) Case Manager Teresa Lam, and RCEB Case Manager Supervisor Ineko Ito. Currently in care are 4 ambulatory clients. During this meeting, it was discussed that all clients currently residing at Yambao Everyday Milestones have surpassed the home's licensed age of 6-17 years old. LPM Wong stated that Community Care Licensing could not issue age exceptions for all four clients because the home would be operating as an adult residential facility under a children's residential license. In order to avoid interruptions in the clients' care, LPM Wong asked Mr. Yambao to provide a reasonable timeline for their transition to an Adult Residential Facility. Mr. Yambao clarified that his current facility would remain open under the current children's residential license, and he would be opening a new facility, licensed as an Adult Residential Facility, that all clients currently in care would transition to once the application process is complete. Mr. Yambao stated that his son has already attended an Adult Residential Facility orientation, and has completed the administrator certification course. Mr. Yambao is currently working on the program design for the new facility with approximately 25-30% completed, and hopes to submit the application by the end of this month, June 2021. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nAt this time, LPM Wong suggested that Mr. Yambao submit both the adult residential facility application and the Regional Center vendorization application at the same time, to help speed the process along. LPM Wong advised Mr. Yambao to submit the application directly to the Sacramento Regional Office, either in person or by certified mail and to keep scanned copies of all documentation in the event that something must be replaced. Mr. Yambao agreed to notify LPA Fremont and LPM Wong when the application for the Adult Residential Facility is submitted, and agreed to include LPA Fremont and LPM Wong on email correspondence going forward in order to receive updates on the process. LPA Fremont will also reach out by email monthly to inquire about updates and provide any needed support to Mr. Yambao. Mr. Yambao has also agreed to submit a written plan and reasonable timeline for this application process and for the transition of clients to the new facility. Plan will be submitted to LPA Fremont and LPM Wong over email no later than 5PM on Friday, 06/11/2021. At this time, all clients currently in care at Mr. Yambao's facility will be allowed to remain in care without age exceptions until the new Adult Residential Facility is licensed and the clients can move to their new home. At this time, no deficiencies are being cited. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee Raphael Yambao to be signed and returned over email no later than 5PM on Thursday, 06/10/2021.",

Regarding staff making inappropriate comments towards minor allegation, confidential interviews stated that staff would not use inappropriate language in the process of calming FC1. Other confidential interviews stated that FC1 would be the one to use vulgar language at staff. LPA couldn\u2019t gather additional information.

The investigation did not provide substantial evidence to substantiate the allegation. There were no witnesses to the incidents. The victim\u2019s statement indicated that the staff provided intervention and followed him, but he declined to return back to the facility because he was frustrated. The staff reported that they followed protocol and attempted to prevent him from leaving but he ignored all interventions. Statements obtained from the confidential interviews provided contradictory information regarding the allegation and did not provide sufficient information to corroborate the allegation. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was emailed to Mr. De La Torre for review and signature due to Covid-19 restriction.

    "narrative": "During the evening shift, staff placed client in a locked bedroom for safety reasons, with one staff on duty outside, in case of emergency. However, staff were unable to remove the latch when another staff arrived to assess the client. The latch had to be cut off for staff to gain entry to the bedroom. Surveillance video show that no staff was placed on duty outside the client\u2019s bedroom and no staff conducted a safety check on the client from 11:00 PM on 12/28/20 until 6:30 AM the following morning. The second allegation was the facility did not have sufficient staff to meet the needs of clients in care. Confidential interviews confirmed that the facility did not have the number of staff needed to properly supervise and meet clients\u2019 needs when the allegation was reported. Clients who were usually placed in separate units due to age and behavior were placed and supervised together. Fast food was purchased to serve to clients during a meal period because there were no kitchen staff available to prepare meals. Surveillance video show that no staff was on duty outside the client\u2019s bedroom and no staff conducted a safety check on the client from 11:00 PM on 12/28/20 until 6:30 AM the following morning. The third allegation was staff were not properly trained to care for a client. Client\u2019s needs were described as beyond staff\u2019s ability to care for but was not denied placement because the facility was a licensed temporary shelter and client met the requirement for placement under Welfare and Institutions Code 300. Records show that client\u2019s needs as described, and noted in transfer of custody, met the placement criteria under the facility\u2019s plan of operation. Furthermore, confidential interviews, supporting documents and surveillance video show that the level of care provided to the client during placement was not consistent with the practice model of what the facility described in its plan of operation. Based on information obtained during investigations conducted by the Department, the preponderance of evidence standard was met, therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. This poses an immediate Health, Safety, and Personal Rights risk to clients in care. Deficiencies are being cited under Title 22, Chapter 5 Group Home Regulations 84072(d)(14); TSCF Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 84665.5(f) and TSCF ILS 84665.3(b). This report and a Plan of Correction was discussed with the facility representative and copies of the following reports: LIC 9099, LIC 9099C, LIC 9099-D and the LIC 811 (Confidential Names dated 7/27/21) and appeal rights were provided at the conclusion of the inspection.\n\nIt was also alleged that the heat was not working in the unit/room client was placed in. LPA obtained varying accounts of what confidential interviewees could recall regarding the temperature in the unit where client was. There was no record of any work order request to address any issue with the temperature inside the facility during client\u2019s placement. Based on the above information, the allegations are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there was no preponderance of evidence found to support it. A copy of this signed report, the LIC 811 (Confidential Names dated 7/27/21) and appeal rights were provided to the facility representative at the conclusion of the inspection.",

MAB techniques can be done by one, two or three persons and they include a list of manual restraints which are time limited. Based on surveillance videos, police report, and statements from C1 and S1, it was revealed that C2 brutally assaulted C1 on 11/26/20. Although S1 gave C2 verbal commands and pulled on his sweater with one hand, he continued punching, kicking, and dragging C1 across the room for approximately two minutes. During the assault, S1 did not attempt to use manual restraint hold nor did she seek immediate assistance even though four other staff members were on duty. S1 stated that due to C2\u2019s size, she was unable to perform a manual restraint, but she admitted that she should have called for assistance sooner. After the assault, C1 was transported to a local hospital via ambulance. A review of C1\u2019s Patient Discharge Instructions revealed that on 11/26/20, C1 was seen at Kern Medical Emergency Department. The attending physician noted the following on the discharge report/diagnosis: Assault; Left facial swelling; Left facial pain; Chest wall pain (see Confidential Names Form dated 3/23//21).

LPA requested for and reviewed incident reports provided by the facility involving a client (C1) named in another incident being addressed by the Department. LPA cross referenced the incident reports with the saved incident reports under the regional office records. LPA did not find any regional office records of the following: An incident report dated 11/23/21 noted that one client reported witnessing inappropriate behavior of C1 towards other female clients in placement. The supervisor\u2019s comments noted that C1\u2019s inappropriate behavior will be addressed and C1 was to be supervised closely However, LPA reviewed four similar incidents after, dated 12/21/21, 12/25/21, 12/26/21 and 12/29/21, wherein C1 continued to engage in inappropriate behavior towards other clients. C1 touched other clients inappropriately in various parts of their bodies, gave some of them unwarranted back massages and hickeys on their necks. If the initial incident report dated 11/23/21 was received by the Department, a written plan of supervision for C1, together with a written safety plan for the other clients in placement, would have been requested by the Department from the facility. continued\n\nBased on the above information, there is supportive evidence found during the review of the incident reports that C1 was not properly supervised, so a deficiency citation is issued for lack of supervision. In addition, there were no records found showing that the facility reported the incidents to the Department as required, so a citation under reporting requirements is also issued. This is the second reporting requirement deficiency citation issued to the facility within a 12 month period. The plans of correction were discussed with the facility representative.

The child was interviewed by law enforcement and the placement agency, so Investigator Lomeli did not interview the child again, to avoid re-victimization. Confidential interviews reveal that the child was inappropriately touched in the top inner thigh area while the child and minor sat next to each other. Child pushed the minor\u2019s hand and walked away. The incident was reported to staff who asked the child to stay away from minor. During another incident, minor attempted to touch the child\u2019s buttocks, but child was able to push minor\u2019s hand away. The child was unable to provide the dates of the incidents, but they occurred during child\u2019s placement between 11/19/21 to 12/10/21. The child did not report the incidents to the placement agency worker. Child did not disclose feeling uncomfortable at placement and did not complain about anyone at the facility. One staff reported that the facility became aware of minor touching other children in care so minor was transferred to another unit with fewer children so minor can be closely supervised. A counselor closely supervised minor when minor is in proximity with other children in placement. Another staff attempted to talk to the child about the incidents, but the child was unwilling to provide any details. There was no statement obtained from the minor by the placement agency and the Department due to a pending case by another agency. Based on the above information, the allegation is closed as unsubstantiated due to the lack of preponderance of evidence. An exit interview was conducted.

On 2/15/22, the Department received an incident report stating that on 2/13/22, facility staff was made aware by other residents that C1 and C2 were claiming to have sex with each other on the night of 2/11/22. Information obtained from incident reports, bed check charts, staff sign-in sheets, Emergency Response Referral Information and interviews, shows C1 and C2 were in a shared room for less than 5 minutes on the night of 2/11/22. Bed charts show the children were assigned to different rooms and were only allowed to sleep together in the same room that night when C1 expressed to staff he was scared to sleep in his room by himself. Follow-up information reveals staff appropriately separated the children when staff observed during a 15-minute interval bed checks that they were not following bedtime instructions (not to get into each other\u2019s bed). The children remained separated until C2 was placed out of the facility on 2/14/22. In addition, a follow up interview with one of the children reveals they don\u2019t know what the word sex means. Further actions taken by the facility includes completing a referral for counseling services for C1. Record review shows there were at least two reportable incidents involving C1 that were never reported to the Department. It is noted that the facility has been recently cited for failure to meet the Reporting Requirements and in the process of correcting the deficiency, therefore, an Advisory Note (Technical Violation) will be issued at this time. Late incident reporting was also addressed. There is no further follow up required regarding the incident involving C1 and C2. This licensing report was reviewed and discussed with the facility representative as well as the Advisory Notes. A signed copy of this report was provided to the facility representative at the conclusion of the inspection along with Confidential Names list (LIC 811) and LIC 9102TV.",

It revealed that Staff Ref. #3 came to assist Ref. #2 with Ref. #1 after Ref. #2 initially restrained Ref. #1. The investigation revealed that Staff Ref. #2 did not call for assistance with Ref. #1, nor write a report after the incident. It revealed that Staff Ref. #2 left the facility without notifying their supervisor and went on leave of absence. Ref. #2 resigned from the facility. The investigation revealed that the facility generated Special Incident Reports, photographs of scratches and marks after both incidents and maintained surveillance video. Ref. #1 was taken to the hospital. The LPA's interview with Ref. #1 revealed that the allegation that Ref. #1 was choked was maintained and there was no mention of Ref. #1 being thrown to the ground. The LPA ended the interview with Ref. #1, because Ref. #1 did not want to cooperate with the interview. The Kern County Sheriff's Office Crime Report indicates that Ref. #1 and Staff Ref. #2 were outside the facility on the basketball court by themselves. It indicated that Ref. #1 has a history of fighting staff, other clients and required daily restraint. The report indicated that the Deputy Sheriff observed the surveillance video that was blurry. The report indicated Staff Ref. #2 appeared to restrain Ref. #1. It revealed that Staff Ref. #2 allowed Ref. #1 to get up after about four minutes and Ref. #1 walked in one direction, while Staff Ref. #2 walked in another direction. The report indicates that the Deputy Sheriff mentioned to Ref. #1 that Staff Ref. #2 did not appear to choke Ref. #2. The report indicates that the Deputy Sheriff interviewed Staff Ref. #2 and Ref. #2 denied choking Ref. #1. The report indicates that the Deputy Sheriff determined there was no violation of the Penal Code. It is determined that there is not sufficient evidence to Substantiate the allegations. There are no witnesses to incident, it is possible that the scratches and marks photographed on Ref. #1 after the second incident could be a result of the first incident with the other client, the surveillance video is blurry, Ref. #1 has a history of engaging in physical altercations with other clients and staff. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegations. So, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding this complaint. This report was emailed to the facility representative.",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that facility staff did not provide adequate supervision, resulting in minors engaging in inappropriate behaviors. Staff (S1, S2) denied the alleged allegation, indicating that clients are supervised adequately by staff by maintaining and adhering to the Interim Licensing Standard of staff to clients ratio of 1:4, or more depending on the needs of the facility. Staff indicated that due to the layout of the facility, anytime a client is in their room, a staff member will be posted in the hallway to ensure clients are safe and remain in their assigned rooms. Staff further stated that the alleged incident was never reported to staff nor did the client (C1) stay long enough to make it past intake, due to C1 AWOling while going through the intake process. Staff indicated that all incidents are reported promptly to the appropriate agencies. Information obtained from CSW, and SSW indicated that C1 never remained at the facility long enough to be processed and would AWOL shortly after being dropped off at the facility. Furthermore, information obtained by SSW from C1 was vague and didn\u2019t coincide with what was originally reported by C1 providing several different versions of the incident. CSW and SSW disclosed that C1 has a history of fabricating stories to manipulate circumstances to benefit her or the situation they are in. CSW indicated that they have no concerns to the care and supervision the facility staff is providing, and that staff keeps exceptional communication with them. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated.

The purpose of the inspection was to conduct a case management follow up on the incident that occurred 12/2/2024 at 1:53 pm C Unit at the facility. The Incident Report submitted to the CCL stated that during the routine room search in C1's (see the LIC811 list of confidential names) room, staff S1 (see LIC811) found a gun frame in the first top drawer of the dresser under the two items of clothing. S1 reported it to the unit lead S2 (LIC811), who reported it to the acting group counselor lead S3. After the item was found, further search of the room was conducted and no further contraband was found. Staff S3 notified Program Director Tim Stevens about the firearm and S3 was advised to contact KCSO to have them pick it up. KCSO was contacted and CHP officer arrived and confiscated the firearm frame. C1 was brought to Jamison following a police chase, where he fled the vehicle with others. CHP reported C1 was searched by at least two officers before bringing him to Jamison and found nothing. Upon release from Jamison to his family, C1 informed Lead Staff S4, that when he came in he had the item tucked into his armpit area under the jacket. CHP responded and took the item and they declined the interview or see the child at that time, pending their investigation. LPA spoke with the Program Director and it was stated by the the Program Director that the child was brought to the facility by the sheriff's after the armed robbery and the high speed car chase: the sheriff did the transfer of custody to Jamison, because C1 parents were unable to pick him up at that time. Law enforcement officers stated they did search the child and did not find any contraband. At Jamison the staff does not pat the children down, and the C1 was asked to lift his shirt at the time of admission and nothing has been found. C1 was given clothes to change and while changing C1 transferred the frame from the old clothes to the new one during the shower time.\n\nThe reason why staff did the room search of C1, because C1 could not find his retainer, and staff was looking through C1 items to find the retainer. That is when the frame was found and the lead staff and program director was notified, and the law enforcement was called to confiscate the contraband. The facility found to be in compliance and no violations have been found. No deficiencies cited at this time. The copy of this report and the LIC811 (List of Confidential names) were e-mailed to the Program Director.",

On that day C1 (See LIC 811 List of Confidential Names) )was placed in one man standing restraint for 3 minutes, and one person restraint on his bed, which lasted for about one minute. LPA requested and was provided with the Plan of Operation Emergency Intervention Plan, Managing Aggressive Behavior (MAB) Participant's Manual and the Certificates for the Emergency Intervention (Staff is trained in Managing Aggressive Behavior and ProAct). EIP does state that the facility utilizes one person standing hold restraint and one person sitting restraint. LPA asked additional questions to the S1 and S1 stated he was called to assist with the child and at the time of restraint the lead staff S2 was present as well as the behavioral therapist, who was at the facility at that time. The S2 and the therapist followed C1 and S1 to the room when the second restraint was done. So the C1 was observed during the restraint. This is not mentioned in the SIR. The Program Director will amend it and will send a new SIR with additional information. The one person manual restraint is approved by the facility's Emergency Intervention Plan and was done in compliance with another person observing C1 during the restraint.

    "narrative": "On 04/02/2025 Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Olena Maico and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Tira Logan-Shanks conducted a virtual meeting via Teams with the facility\u2019s Program Director Tim Stevens, Maria Bermudez, Assistant Director, Director of Human Services of the Kern County Lito Murillo, and Andrea Hawk, Program Specialist. The reason for the meeting was to follow up on the Security Restraint Protocols that facility had in place. On 03/11/2025 the Department received a Special Incident Report (SIR), which stated that one of the clients was restraint by security due to the client posing danger to the themselves, other clients in care and the staff. After reviewing the SIR, LPA also reviewed the Emergency Intervention Plan for the facility and have not observed the protocols for the facility to utilize security personnel to conduct restraints as a part of the facility EIP. Following the review, LPA requested information from the Program Director on the security restraint protocols and the documentation or record of the procedure approval by the licensing. Program Director sent the security restraint protocols that facility had in place to the LPA. The facility had no record of the protocols being approved by the Licensing. LPA also reviewed Field Automated System and the facility folder and have not located any approval information for the protocols. The Licensing had a concern that utilizing security to conduct restraints on the clients does not meet the emergency intervention training for staff required by the licensing, nor they have a criminal record clearance from the Department. Therefore, they do not meet the qualifications of staff to provide care and supervision, which include de-escalation and restraints. The SIRs state security was contacted, and a restraint was used, there is no identifying information for security staff involved. if there was an incident that rose to the level of action needed by Department, CCLD would be concerned since the security staff does not meet all of the above mentioned criteria.\n\nDuring the meeting, LPM inquired about the role of the security in the facility. Mr. Morillo stated that security is provided on all locations that county oversee to ensure of staff and clients safety due to clients of the facility having complex behavioral, emotional and psychological issues. They oversee the grounds and the perimeter of the facility as well as assist when people enter the facility utilizing safety protocols. They also assist with the contraband searches on the premises as needed. Assistant Director also added that security staff, which is provided by the third party Trans West Security, mostly utilized for the assistance with the security purposes if clients become escalated and the restraint procedures were not intended to be a regular practice. The procedures were intended to be a last resort to prevent serious injury for the staff and clients. Since Licensing contacted the facility about the security restraint protocols, all the operations and restraints by security were suspended by the facility and the facility has been in discussion on the adjustment of the protocols. Today the facility also having a higher level management meeting on further planning and implementing of the protocols to meet licensing requirements and ensure of the safety of staff and clients. Facility also conducting an internal review to follow up on the incident and discuss with the staff involved and staff present at the time incident occurred. LPM also mentioned if the facility would like to utilize security staff to assist wit the restraints protocols, the security personnel will have to meet the CCLD requirements for emergency intervention protocols (fingerprinting and training). The only personnel who would be exempt from the CCLD requirements would be a sworn peace officers. Facility also inquired about the use of metal detectors and if any other counties were using the metal detectors and LPM stated that that is not approved by CCLD at this time due to the procedure being a personal rights violation and would be considered as an unreasonable search. LPA will follow up with the facility once facility completes their review and assessment of current policies and procedures. No citations were issued at this time. The copy of this report was provided via e-mail to all the parties who took a part in this meeting. The signature for the facility will be provided on the hard copy to the LPA.",

In attendance were: Regional Manager (RM) Lacresha Cook, Licensing Program Managers (LPMs) Stephanie Hudak and Ann Valenzuela, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Gloria Meza-Gonzalez; TSCF Representatives, Deputy Director (DD) Norma Rincon, Protective Service Program Managers (PSPM) Elizabeth Rosas, Alicia Rogers, Lerone Jenkins, and System of Care Manager (SCM) Marjana Jackson. The following issues were discussed: \uf0b7 Complaints \uf0b7 Reporting Requirements \uf0b7 Emergency Intervention Plan \uf0b7 Overstays During the meeting, LPM Hudak discussed increase of complaints at TSCF in the last three years. In 2019 there were 23 complaints, in 2020 there were 26 complaints and as of May 24, 2021 there are 20 complaints. The majority of the complaints have to do with supervision and personal rights such as unexplained injuries on foster youth, inappropriate interaction with foster youth, handling foster youth in rough manner, and lack of intervening between foster youth. DD Rincon was given the opportunity to speak regarding the increase of complaints. DD Rincon stated that they have noticed the increase of complaints as well. She stated over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic things have changed. DD Rincon stated that service providers had stopped coming for foster youth with high behavior needs, new staff, and the census was in the 90s. She said that they have started to look to bring in services that will help address all the issues for the increase of complaints. DD stated they are in the process of procuring a contract that will assist Nurture Heart Program with behavior modification for foster youth with high behavior issues. DD Rincon stated that the plan for staffing is for staff to take refresher courses and immediately train new staff on the interventions. She said that they are working on partnering with community services, enlisting help to locate advocates to help support their CSEC population, establishing a mentor program, and offer enrichment for therapy program through San Diego Probation Department. See page 2\n\nLPM Hudak discussed reporting requirements in terms of receiving Special Incident Reports (SIRs) untimely. She said the Department is receiving the 24-hour notification however the Department is receiving the full detailed SIRs between three weeks to four weeks late. LPM Hudak explained that it is important to receive the SIR timely as the Regional Office also has time frames to report to CCL Program Office of arrests, injuries, etc. DD Rincon stated that they sat down as a team to discuss the SIRs, to hold staff and managers accountable, to allow staff to step away after the incident has been dealt with to write up the SIR and for the TSCF CCL liaison to follow up within 24 to 48 hours to ensure the SIR is submitted timely. She stated that they discuss with new staff the importance of SIRs, weekly SIRs, documentation training, and 1:1 SIR coaching. DD Rincon stated they have a couple of social workers that have re-assigned to help process SIRs. LPM Hudak discussed emergency intervention plan. LPM Hudak asked if the facility reviews restraint SIRs and PSPM Jenkins said yes. PSPM Jenkins stated they debrief with staff on what went well, what worked and what did not work. He said they look at training for refresher courses. DD Rincon stated that they have Proact training every month for new staff and refresher for ongoing staff every year. She said new staff attend Proact immediately upon hire. DD Rincon said that the contracted support staff attends Proact training. LPM Hudak discussed overstay reports. LPM Hudak stated she reviewed the last quarterly report and there were 29 children with over 10 day overstays. DD Rincon discussed strategies for the 10 days overstays. She said they are utilizing ILT processes in which Child Welfare Director, Judge, Deputy Director, Education, Probation, and the Regional Center come together to discuss barriers to placement. DD Rincon said that they discuss how to reduce the length of stay and how-to bring change of placement. When asked about placing out of county, DD Rincon stated that reason foster youth are not placed out of county is due to court order, legal reasons, visitations, and lack of placement. LPM Hudak informed DD Rincon that there are newly licensed out of county placement that boarder San Diego and Riverside in Murrieta and Temecula. LPM Hudak asked if they utilized Resource Foster Agencies that take Intellectual delayed foster youth and DD said yes. LPM Hudak asked if they are utilizing Polinsky\u2019s Nest homes and they said due to the COVID-19 pandemic they placed themselves on a voluntary hold, and subsequently there is a reduction of NEST beds available. LPM Hudak requested that in the 10 day overstay reports to include details and dates of the delay in placement process. DD Rincon stated the facility has weekly managers meetings to discuss all the concerns LPM Hudak had discussed in the meeting. In lieu of the issues presented during this meeting, the TSCF is being required to submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) detailing the following: 1) How the facility is working on reducing complaints, 2) ensuring Title 22 reporting requirements are met; 3) staffing training plan to include, supervision, and emergency interventions; and 4) providing more details on the overstay reports on the progress of placement. The CAP will be due 30 days from the date of this report. All recommendations/suggestions and requirements given during the meeting by both CCL and TSCF were acknowledged. It was also suggested that Polinsky incorporate these types of changes in their Plan of Operation/Program Statement and submit the changes to the Department for review. See page 3.\n\nIn closing, all parties were satisfied with all information that was discussed during the meeting. CCL will follow-up with the TSCF in 30 days. A copy of this report reviewed and emailed to with PSPM Rosas. Original signature will be placed in file.",

    "narrative": "On April 28, 2022, at 10:00 AM, an office conference was held virtually with A.B. Polinsky Children\u2019s Center Temporary Shelter Care Facility (TSCF) via Microsoft Teams. In attendance were: Regional Manager (RM) Lacresha Cook, Licensing Program Managers (LPM) Ann Valenzuela, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Gloria Meza-Gonzalez; TSCF Representatives, Assistant Director Child Welfare (ADCWS) Alfredo Guardado, Deputy Director (DD) Norma Rincon, Protective Service Program Managers (PSPM) Elizabeth Rosas, Alicia Rogers, Lerone Jenkins, System of Care Manager (SCM) Marjana Jackson and System of Care Policy Analyst Gina Jones. The following issues were discussed: \u00b7 Number of complaints since the last informal conference on May 24, 2021 \u00b7 Staff Supervision \u00b7 Youth sustaining injuries while in care \u00b7 Absent without approved leave (AWOLs) \u00b7 Minors smoking on grounds \u00b7 Allegations of staff inappropriately handling youth \u00b7 Allegations of staff not intervening during altercations \u00b7 Law Enforcement Special Incident Reports During the meeting, LPM Valenzuela discussed the increase of complaints at TSCF in the last year. The last informal conference was on May 24, 2021, there were 41 complaints with multiple allegations. The department has received 23 complaints regarding staff causing harm or verbally to minors in care, 18 complaints about lack of supervision, 7 complaints of minors sustaining unexplained injuries/bruises while in care, and three complaints dealing with access to drugs and alcohol. DD Rincon was given the opportunity to speak regarding the increase in complaints. DD Rincon stated that they have noticed the increase in complaints as well. She stated a lot of the complaints are related to the increase of high-needs youth that entered TSCF and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the County has had a lack of community resources that include foster caregivers, changes in the juvenile justice system which led to youth at TSCF\u2019s staying a longer period of time. DD Rincon stated that pre-pandemic the TSCF used to have one to three high needs youths however during the last year in months, December to March, the facility had a lot of high needs youth more than the TSCF has seen before due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She stated that she has noticed the pandemic is on the downward trend and they noticed that a lot of the high needs youths that are making a lot of the allegations are being placed in appropriate settings. DD Rincon stated that a lot of the same youth were also AWOLing from the facility and since those youth were no longer in placement; the AWOLs have decreased. She said that currently, the TSCF has five youth that has been identified as high needs. DD Rincon stated that they are working on finding placements for the five youths. See LIC809c page 2\n\nDD Rincon stated the challenges the TSCF had because of the pandemic from December 3, 2021, through the beginning of April 2022 was that they were in outbreak status which resulted in 120 positives in the TSCF which included both youth and staff being sick. During that time, they were unable to place a lot of the youths. DD Rincon reported that some of the things they started to work on are doing some additional staff training, they have implemented some Lived experience coaching and services through South Bay Community Services Center which is an achievement center that provides support services and social support to the youths. DD Rincon stated they have partnered with San Diego Probation to access services in which the youth will receive therapeutic services, coaching and mentoring from people with Lived experience, and outings that are all trauma-informed. TSCF supervisors and managers are being provided with additional training using appropriate engagement models and have partnered with Just In Time which is a community-based organization. Just In Time has provided some training on youth engagement. All the managers, supervisors, and staff have participated in the training. DD Rincon stated that PSPM Jenkins is in charge of the Nurtured Heart Program and has also incorporated monthly Nurtured Heart training for all the staff. He has focused the training within the cottages because traditionally the staff is assigned to the same cottage who work with high-needs youth. For the younger youth, they have the developmental screening program through Rady\u2019s hospital that has returned to campus since the pandemic; and provides specialized training to staff for those youth with developmental delays. DD Rincon stated they have completed refresher training regarding the SIRs. They have implemented learning circles in which they pick certain topics to educate the supervisors so they can be better equipped to support the staff on the floor. TSCF utilizes ProACT and has done some advanced training with all the duty officers on campus so the duty officers can be better equipped to support the staff on campus. DD Rincon reported they are focusing on the de-escalation techniques of the Enhanced ProACT Model so they can help support the high-needs youth. She stated they are looking into other models that are being utilized from other programs to see what type of de-escalation techniques they use to see if it\u2019s anything they want to incorporate into the TSCF program. DD Rincon stated they have been doing the ProACT model and the Nurtured Heart Program and have found them to be effective, however, they are looking into exploring other models to assist in supporting the staff. They have engaged in assistance with a Safety Consultant referred by another county that utilizes another model called the CARE model. Which is a model that creates a team of responders when a crisis starts to happen and responds to the situation as it is happening. DD Rincon stated they have also put out a proposal to enhance the TSCF mental health services. She stated they are changing the model to have rehabilitation staff that is specially trained in crisis intervention that will be assigned to the cottages in addition to mental health one on one and group settings to serve the needs of the youth. Psycho-educational groups would be provided for substance abuse, vaping, and CSEC youth as well as AWOLing youth once the program is in effect. See LIC809c Page 3\n\nDD Rincon stated that another challenge was during the last 6 months, November 2021 through March 2022, the facility had to bring in additional temporary staffing to maintain the staff-to-client ratios. She stated the staff was not their permanent staff as they had to rely on temporary staff such as Protective Service Workers. She stated that permanent staff has been returning to work and being trained, and as a result AWOLs have reduced over the last month, SIRs have been on a downward trend, placements of high needs youth are happening, and using the State Technical Assistance calls have also helped the program. RM Cook reviewed the AB388 unit\u2019s incident reports and concerns. Angela King is the Licensing Program Manager for the Law Enforcement (LE) incident reports. LPM King sent information regarding LE incident reports. RM Cook stated that there has been a total of 329 LE incident reports this year, from January 1, 2022, through April 25, 2022. 304 incident reports were AWOLs, 11 incident reports were assaults and/or physical aggressions, 9 incident reports were harm to self and/or psychological and 5 incident reports were behavior and/or property damage. She stated the TSCF uses its own reports however some questions are not being answered when completing the incident reports such as: Was the escort or restraint documented in the youth\u2019s restraint log? Was the restraint incident debriefed? The reports do not mention the type of debriefing or describe the type of the debriefs after the incident. Were de-escalation techniques utilized before contacting law enforcement? RM Cook also advised of incomplete incident reports where the \u201cprepared by\u201d and \u201capproved by\u201d sections were not always filled out and youth race and ethnicity are not always consistently documented in the SIR. DD Rincon addressed the concerns regarding the incident reports. She stated that PSPM Rosas oversees the incident reports and recently started reviewing all the incident reports so it is not just the supervisors and line staff therefore PSPM will be paying attention to those details as well as identifying some of the training needs for the staff on campus. LPA Meza-Gonzalez mentioned the AWOLs occurring at the back fence and youth bringing in contraband on campuses such as vape pens and alcohol through the back fence and hiding it in the bushes on campus and/or the youth hiding the contraband on their person. DD Rincon stated the Safety Consultant provided ideas to help minimize contraband from coming on campus by adding additional security, adding additional security cameras around the perimeter of the campus as well as the cameras being monitored 24 hours in real-time by a posted person. The San Diego Sheriff Department had done an assessment of the facility. DD Rincon stated the facility is in the process of installing some anti-climbing fences. On February 14, 2022, the facility began renovations in which the campus will be renovated and installing the security features such as the cameras. DD Rincon stated they are trying to be trauma-informed in the security measures. They have a proposal in procurement with new policies and procedures that are being reviewed by San Diego County leadership. Perimeter checks are being completed by Duty officers and bushes are being removed and replaced with grass. See LIC 809 C page 4\n\nLPM Valenzuela will follow up and send information regarding the cameras. RM Cook stated when facility policies are changed and/or initiated the facility Program Statement needs to be updated and in compliance with regulations. Due to technical difficulties at the end of the meeting, the virtual meeting dropped via Microsoft Teams connection. DD Rincon contacted LPA Meza-Gonzalez to complete the meeting via the telephone with LPM Valenzuela. DD Rincon stated that the facility is also working with the youth\u2019s attorney to provide additional support. An email was forwarded to DD Rincon and PSPM Rosas from LPM Valenzuela with an attachment entitled Family Finding Resource from the System of Care Branch Manager (SCM) Marjana Jackson. The facility has agreed to the following: 1) An updated Program Statement that incorporates the new training and models the facility will utilize for de-escalation techniques will be submitted to CCL by the end of July 2022. 2) Ensuring Title 22 reporting requirements are met including Law Enforcement Contact Review Unit recommendations for SIRs. 3) PSPM Rosas will send information regarding the installation and use of cameras to LPA Meza-Gonzalez by May 15, 2022. A copy of this report was reviewed and emailed to PSPM Rosas. The original signature will be placed in the file.",

Confidential interviews revealed that on a couple of occasions the food was undercooked however it was brought to the attention of the cafeteria staff, and the food was replaced. On August 3, 2021, LPA Meza-Gonzalez observed in the cafeteria seven days of non-perishable food and two days of perishable food. Confidential information revealed inconsistencies in the staff ratio to clients. It\u2019s alleged that there is insufficient staffing in the cottages when staff is assigned one-to-one supervision however the duty officer and supervisors are counted as part of the ratio to clients. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 did have a Nintendo Switch as part of C1\u2019s inventory however C1 chose not to keep it in the safe for safeguarding, and the Nintendo Switch was stolen. C1 signed an electronic device agreement in which it states that the clients are responsible for their devices if lost or stolen if they choose not to store them in the safe. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 was assigned to a cottage that was not the gender C1 identified. Additional interviews revealed that C1 identified with both genders. Additional interviews revealed inconsistencies to whether C1 asked to move to the gender cottage with which C1 identified. Based on confidential interviews the allegations staff does not ensure the clients are properly fed while in care, the facility is operating out of ratio, staff did not safeguard a C1's personal belongings, and staff does not provide an appropriate sleeping arrangement for a minor while in care may or may not have occurred, however, the allegation is not supported or proven by the evidence gathered.

S1 then attempted to close the staff door but C1, being seated outside the staff door, extended their leg, preventing the door from closing. S1 then raised their own foot in an effort to move C1's leg and when that did not work, S1 moved C1's leg with their hand and closed the staff door. During the camera footage review, it was acknowledged by the administrator and administrator in training, that there did not appear to be any reason for S1 to have placed hands on C1 as it did not appear that C1 was exhibiting any behaviors that warranted S1 to make physical contact with C1. As a result of the investigation conducted including camera footage review and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff handled minor in a rough manner is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met.

    "narrative": "Youth are able to have these plates of food any time between those hours but at 10:00 PM, they only offer youth snack items or fruit if they express that they are hungry. This policy has been vetted in the facility's program statement and approved by the Department. During the alleged incident, youth was offered the snack and fruit but refused. Youth was offered food and refused and as a result, the allegation that youth was denied access to food is UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that staff mishandled a minor's personal belongings is related to C1's planarians which are free-living flatworms that, depending on the specific species, can be hazardous to humans. C1 was in possession of a small tank containing these planarians when they arrived at the facility but claimed they were not dangerous. C1 was told they could not bring them into the dorm and they needed to be stored outdoors. C1 explained that the planarians would die if they got too warm, even if still in water. Agency policy is to not allow pets or other critters into the dorm as they could be harmful to youth in care. C1 brought the small tank into their room and was keeping the small tank in their personal belongings without staff knowledge. Agency staff stated that upon finding out the tank was in client's bedroom, did not force C1 to then put it back outside and did attempt to educate themselves on the planarians. As a result of the investigation, the allegation that staff mishandled C1's personal belongings is UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted and document was provided to the facility, along with appeal rights.",

Confidential interviews were conducted with youth and staff and revealed that it is agency policy to only give youth fruit or snack items past their bedtime. Staff indicate that meals are sent to the dorms by the kitchen staff and typically they get two to four additional plates of food, depending on the number of youth in care, for when youth get hungry between dinner time and bedtime.",

Youth did not take the call into their room for privacy and instead continued their call in the main room of the dorm where all individuals present could hear. C1 made no effort to be discrete during their phone call. The allegation related to staff behavior poses as a risk to a minor is related to S1 and C1 having a conversation during which C1 made comments to S1 about their lack of qualifications and experience. S1 disengaged in the initial conversation. When C1 went to their room, S1 went into the room to check in with C1. The conversation between C1 and S1 escalated again and S1 perceived that C1 was coming after S1 in an aggressive manner. When S1 exited the room, they closed the door behind them, placing their body against the door, preventing C1 from exiting their room. S2 stepped in at that time to de-escalate the situation, requesting S1 to leave the dorm. Confidential interviews conducted failed to indicate S1's behavior posed a risk to C1 during this exchange.

    "narrative": "During a review of the incidents involving youth in care, there were several incidents requiring staff verbal and/or physical interventions to keep youth separated or to redirect youth. Confidential interviews with staff and clients in care indicated that each of the youth play a part in harassing, bullying, and using racial and offensive slurs at one another since being in the facility. During one particular incident on 6/26/25, C1 did kick C2 out of frustration which lead to C2 being escalated and another youth getting involved and throwing items at C1. Confidential interviews with staff and clients indicated that all three youth have been known to behave in ways that escalate the other in care which leads to the youth yelling and screaming at one another, slinging racial slurs at one another, attempts to hit or kick one another, and even engage by throwing items at one another. Staff indicated that their intervention protocol is to get in between youth to prevent physical contact, redirecting youth outside of the dorm until things calm down, removing youth from the immediate area but that physical intervention is a last resort and used only in times when imminent danger exists. Staff interviewed indicated they have been trained in de-escalation techniques and they do utilize all avenues available to keep youth from harming others or saying awful things to one another. Staff indicated that they can typically de-escalate the youth by getting them outside of the facility to play basketball, go for a walk, or employing soothing techniques designated by their therapist. As a result of the investigation conducted including interviews with staff and clients and review of incident reports, the allegations that staff did not prevent minor from hitting another minor in care and that staff did not prevent minors from harassing another minor in care are UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

The purpose of this visit is a follow-up for a Case Management conducted on January 26, 2023 for SIR #841120. LPA was informed that Claudia Rice, Division Director is not in the office today. During the investigation, three (3) staff and one (1) client were interviewed. LPA Edison determined Client #1 (C1) was able to gain access to Staff #1 (S1) badge and use the badge to access the main building of the facility. Additional information received from Division Director states that badge procedures are discussed during onboarding training with staff which includes the purpose of the badge and what staff should do if the badge is lost. Division Director stated that badge procedures are discussed by the supervisor as a verbal conversation with staff to address keeping the badge on their person. It is unclear why S1 removed the badge and set it down making it accessible to C1. CIS was advised by LPA that they will discuss conducting additional staff training on supervision and badge security and providing LPA with documentation once the staff training has been completed with Division Director. CIS stated will inform Division Director regarding LPA advisory on how to prevent this incident from occurring again. LPA Edison issued a technical assistance advisory to facility to conduct additional staff training regarding badge policy and security. Based on the observations made during today\u2019s visit, no deficiencies were cited per Title 22, Division 6, of the California Code of Regulations. Exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report will be emailed to the Division Director.",

As a result of being restrained, C1 did not sustain any bruising or injuries.

Staff further denied staff using foul language or taunting C1 during incident. LPA was unable to obtain video footage of incident.

During the investigation, confidential interviews and documentary evidence were reviewed. Statements indicate that minor attempted to swing at staff with a pen. Statements indicate that due to minor\u2019s assaultive history with staff and safety concerns for minor and others, staff restrained minor. Confidential interviews and documentary evidence did not corroborate staff pulled minor\u2019s hair and scratched minor while minor was being restrained. Statements indicate that minor has very long hair which extends down minor\u2019s back. Statements indicate that on the day of the incident, minor\u2019s hair was not tied in a ponytail, therefore, child\u2019s hair may have gotten tangled during the restraint due to the length of minor\u2019s hair, attempting to hit staff, and thrashing around during the restraint. LPA obtained Special Incident Report (SIR), staff ProAct training certificates, and nurse assessment for minor from the day of the incident.",

The youth was told it was against facility policy to unlock the gate. On 07/03/20 LPA Alarcon conducted a case management regarding the locked gate. LPA was told by the Director the front gate is now locked, and the back gate was unlocked. During an unannounced in-person inspection of the facility on 08/02/2020, LPAs Raulito Alarcon and Tana Kinder observed that the back gate feeds into an enclosed property of a San Joaquin County school. This property is secured with a lock which does not belong to Mary Graham.

This poses a potential Personal Rights, Health and Safety risk to clients. Exit interview conducted.

The incident report stated the nurse was distributing medication to two residents within the same dorm. The nurse had placed the medications into a medication cup and transported the medications to the dorm. Upon distributing the medications it was found a medication was given to the wrong child. LPA contacted the Director to determine the process of dispensing medications. The Director stated there is a medication cart in the nurse's station. The medication cart has a medication drawer that has each child's medication. On top of the cart is a binder with a Medication Administration Record (MAR) which indicates medications for a child and instructions. The Director stated the child is typically brought to the nurse's station and waits at the door. The nurse will dispense medication according to the MAR into the dispensing cup and provide water to the child as well. Due to COVID-19 procedures and limiting the commingling of children, the nurse was dispensing the medications to each dorm. The medication cups were not labeled. LPA discussed a plan with the Director to prevent future medication errors. The Director stated the nurse will identify the child's medication cup by writing the child's name on the medication cup. The cups will be labeled with the child's name to ensure medications are provided to the correct child upon providing medication. Exit interview conducted, Copy of report given.",

LPA conducted confidential interviews with three youths, one adult and reviewed the initial special incident report, dated February 03, 2022. The interviews were consistent the client was touched accidentally while playing with other youth in care. However, the incident was a result of horseplaying. The youth were previously prompted on several occasions to stop but ignored. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.",

    "narrative": "there are clients in the care of the shelter that need additional supervision or have behaviors that warrant additional supervision than the other clients and the shelter does not staff to that need. All staff interviewed indicated that C31 (see LIC811 dated 11/3/22) has behaviors that always warrant heightened supervision and possibly one staff assigned to C31, but the facility does not staff to this need. In addition, interviews with staff and clients indicate that staff to client ratios are typically five or six clients to one staff during the day which is out of compliance with the required four clients to one staff. Regarding the allegation that facility staff did not provide supervision to clients involved in the distribution, possession and/or use of marijuana, this allegation is related to the facility not intervening to remove marijuana or other contraband clients are found to be in possession of while at the facility. Ten of twelve clients interviewed confirmed that the staff at the facility would not intervene to stop the clients from smoking marijuana or vapes while in the facility. Clients also stated that staff \u201cdon\u2019t try\u201d to confiscate drugs or other contraband and that if they are found to be in possession of contraband, the staff write it up, but nothing is done after that. Clients also confirmed that staff in the AFS (Absent from Shelter) cottage, did little to nothing to confiscate contraband or tell clients to not smoke in their rooms in the cottage. One staff interviewed indicated that the clients have a right to smoke, despite being under the legal age limit. Twelve of twelve staff reported that there is very little that they can do to remove contraband because \u201cthey have rights\u201d and have been told that they can\u2019t touch clients to remove contraband or other unauthorized items. Additionally, the Director reported a lack of drug use training for staff and staff confirmed inadequate training to identify substance use and detection, as addressed in the 9/14/22 complaint findings issued on the same date as the findings for this complaint investigation. Regarding the allegation that facility staff did not provide supervision to clients involved in sexual touching and/or assaulting other clients, this allegation is related to the facility not intervening or being present to stop unwanted or inappropriate touching between clients. Eight of twelve clients interviewed confirmed that they engaged in sexual contact while at the facility and that it was not always consensual. Interviews confirmed that staff either didn\u2019t check on them or staff could do little to nothing to stop the interactions. Confidential interviews with clients revealed that staff were either not present or failed to provide adequate care to keep clients safe. One staff interview indicated clients have a right to have sex in the cottage and that staff intervention would only be necessary if a sexual assault were occurring, with the assumption that \u201cthe client would ask for help during the assault.\u201d One client interviewed stated that they were touched inappropriately\n\nby another client at the facility when they were supposed to be in their beds and going to sleep but that staff never came to their room to check on them, thus not preventing the inappropriate touching. Regarding the allegation that facility staff did not provide supervision to clients threatening other clients with violence, this allegation is related to fighting in the cottage, threats of violence from clients to other clients, and clients being physically aggressive towards and hitting clients and staff. Nine of twelve confidential interviews with clients demonstrated that staff did not do what they could to stop fights from turning physical and once they got physical, they did little to stop this too. One client\u2019s interview detailed an assault on another client that the client intervened to stop because no staff was present to intervene or prevent the assault. Confidential interviews with clients alerted to staff blaming client(s) by \u201cinstigating\u201d incident(s) meaning that a client\u2019s behavior leads to or causes assaults. One client reported having to fight three clients with staff present and staff did nothing to intervene. Records reviewed showed that 53 out of 58 staff either did not have MABPro Emergency Intervention training or the certifications were expired. Staff interviewed reported that because the facility does not have enough staff to keep eyes on clients, staff are not appropriately trained in emergency interventions and/or staff are not sufficient in numbers to physically intervene, staff can only verbally redirect clients to comply and hope that clients listen. (The facility not being compliant with this training plan is addressed in the 10/14/22 complaint findings issued on the same date as the findings for this complaint investigation.) As a result of the information obtained, documentation reviewed, confidential interviews conducted with staff and clients, the allegations that the facility maintains an insufficient quantity of staff to meet the needs of the clients in care, facility staff did not provide supervision to clients involved in the distribution, possession and/or use of marijuana, facility staff did not provide supervision to clients involved in sexual touching and/or assaulting other clients, and facility staff did not provide supervision to clients threatening other clients with violence are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. Facility cited for Type A violation of Transitional Shelter Care Facilities, Interim Licensing Standards, Regulation 84665.5(f): Staff Ratios. Records review, confidential interviews with staff and clients indicate that the facility is not providing the care and supervision needed to keep clients safe, in that the facility is required to evaluate clients and if they require special care and supervision due to age, problem behaviors\n\nor other factors, they are to increase the number of on-duty staff. All staff interviewed conformed that the facility is staffed to ratio. The facility is not evaluating the staffing need based on observed unsafe behaviors including but not limited to inappropriate interactions between clients, clients physical and sexually assaulting other clients, clients physically assaulting staff, age of the clients in care, or other observed problem behaviors including possession of drugs, alcohol, and other contraband which poses and immediate risk to the safety of the clients in care. Facility cited for Type A violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 80078(a): Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Confidential interviews with staff and clients indicate that the facility is not providing the care and supervision as necessary to meet the clients\u2019 needs including having sufficient staff persons on duty to physically intervene in physical altercations or other aggressive behaviors, shadow clients during walkabouts as identified in clients\u2019 individualized plans, or when engaging in appropriate or inappropriate activities in the cottages which poses an immediate risk to the clients in the care of the facility. Facility cited for a Type A violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 84072(d): Personal Rights. The licensee shall ensure that each child, regardless of whether the child is in foster care, is accorded the personal rights specified in Welfare and Institutions Code section 16001.9, as applicable, including the right to live in a safe, healthy, and comfortable home where they are treated with respect. Investigation shows that clients were not provided with this right as evidenced by the failure to appropriately staff and provide supervision to prevent or safeguard clients from threats of violence, sexual activity or assaults, and/or the continued possession and use of marijuana in the facility, which poses an immediate health, safety or personal rights risk to the rights of clients to live in a safe and healthy environment as required by this regulation. Exit interview conducted with Ms. McCoy and documents, including appeal rights, were provided via email.\n\n\u201cgirl\u2026if I wasn\u2019t working here I would beat you up\u201d or \u201c[if you mess with my car], I\u2019ll lose my job\u2026\u201d where clients perceived an implicit threat of harm. During a client interview, it was reported that staff made a comment that a client may have instigated a fight, insinuating that the client deserved to be attacked by other clients. While these comments were not direct threats, interviews largely supported a lack of trauma-informed care as some staff were reported as being rude and making disparaging remarks to and about clients in care. As a result of interviews conducted with staff and clients the allegation that facility staff threaten and intimidate clients in care is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview conducted with Ms. McCoy and documentation provided to the facility.",

    "narrative": "appropriately to stop altercations or other acts of aggression and/or violence. Confidential interviews with staff and clients indicate that the facility does not have sufficiently trained staff to adequately prevent or physically intervene when these physical altercations happen. Evidence showed that of the 58 staff records reviewed, 53 records indicate that staff members are out of compliance, expired or missing, for MABpro (Management of Assaultive Behavior) training. When questioned about emergency intervention training, the Director states that they are in transition to Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI) and is aware that they are currently not in compliance. Nine of twelve confidential interviews with clients demonstrated that staff did not do what they could to stop fights from turning physical or did little to nothing to stop this too. One client\u2019s interview detailed an assault on another client that the client intervened to stop because no staff was present to intervene or prevent the assault. Confidential interviews with clients alerted to staff blaming client(s) by \u201cinstigating\u201d incident(s) meaning that a client\u2019s behavior leads to or causes assaults. One client reported having to fight three clients with staff present and staff did nothing to intervene. (The facility not being compliant with this training plan is addressed in the 10/14/22 complaint findings issued on the same date as the findings for this complaint investigation.) Regarding the allegation that minor\u2019s behavior poses a risk to other minors, this allegation is related to the facility not intervening to keep other clients safe when behavioral or aggressive incidents happen at the facility. Investigation shows that there are clients in the care of the shelter that need additional supervision or have behaviors that, when escalated, can pose a danger to other clients in the facility, as shown by the facility\u2019s lack of compliance addressed in the 7/18/22 and 9/2/22 complaint findings issued on the same date as the findings for this complaint investigation. All staff interviewed indicated that C31 (see LIC811 dated 11/3/22) has aggressive and violent behaviors that warrant heightened supervision and possibly one staff assigned, but the facility does not staff to this need. Confidential interviews revealed that staff do not physically intervene when altercations happen between clients at the facility due to lack of training. Several client plans revealed the facility failed to identify appropriate intervention plans based on documented child welfare, mental health, and behavioral history of the client to ensure the safety of the subject client and/or other clients in the facility. In regards to placement decisions, staff reported limitations regarding a lack of space or having insufficient information in deciding where to safely place a client at intake. Staff and clients reported placing \u201cbehaviorally challenged\u201d clients in a separate cottage (also referred to as the \u201cbad kids cottage\u201d or \u201cAWOL cottage\u201d) with no additional staffing or supervision measures despite knowledge of the client(s) history of drug use, physical altercations and prior incidents of running away from the facility.\n\nRegarding the allegation that the facility is out ratio, this allegation is related to the facility staffing the facility to the ratio of the clients that the shelter has in their care rather than to the need of the clients in the shelter. Investigation shows staff are frequently out of ratio of four clients to one staff in the cottages and particularly when clients walk out of the cottage, requiring a staff follow. While the regulations allow that additional staff be on call and capable of arriving at the facility (cottage) within 30 minutes, confidential interviews demonstrated that the staff are frequently out of ratio beyond this allowed 30 minutes. Investigation shows that staff to client ratios are typically five or six clients to one staff which is out of compliance with the required four clients to one staff during the day. Multiple confidential client interviews demonstrated that clients in the \u201cbad kid cottage\u201d (also referred to as the \u201cAWOL cottage\u201d) were frequently out of ratio as there were frequently more than eight clients but only two staff in the cottage. Regarding the allegation that facility staff are not providing adequate supervision to minors, this allegation is related to the staff not being able to provide the approved interventions for clients in care due to a lack of staffing. Clients identify coping skills in their Individual Plans written and approved by the facility which may include \u201cwalkabouts\u201d. Interviews demonstrated that this means that when a client gets frustrated or anxious, they can walk about the campus to release feelings of frustration and/or anxiety. However, staff indicate that when a client asks for this, more times than not they have to tell the client to wait for additional staff if additional staff are available to come. In addition, confidential interviews revealed that when staff call for additional staff to perform these functions or to take over for cottage ratio, they are met with staff telling them to \u201cmake do.\u201d Multiple staff interviews indicate that the facility does not staff to the need of the clients in care rather ratio of the clients in care. Confidential interviews with staff and clients also demonstrated that clients are often caught in explosive or violent incidents at the facility due to not having enough staff to keep clients not involved safe while also intervening to stop behaviors including inappropriate interactions, aggression, and fighting amongst clients. Records reviewed demonstrates that 53 out of 58 staff either did not have MABPro (Management of Assaultive Behavior) training or the certifications were expired. Staff interviewed reported that the facility does not have enough staff to keep eyes on clients, staff are not appropriately trained in emergency interventions and/or staff are not sufficient in numbers to physically intervene and can only verbally redirect clients to comply and hope that they do. Additionally, the Director stated that she does not go out on the floor often to see what is happening. Regarding the allegation that facility staff do not meet the minimum qualifications required, this allegation is\n\nrelated to facility staff not having the appropriate training to meet the needs of clients that are accepted at the facility. All staff interviewed indicated that clients accepted to the facility include developmentally delayed clients, clients with mental health issues, behavioral health issues, violent tendencies, and aggression, to name a few. Several staff reported having inadequate training in order to meet the needs of the clients. One staff indicated the facility does not have adequately trained staff to meet the mental health needs of the clients. Additionally, multiple staff reported not receiving training on trauma-informed care. The Director states that the facility needs training on drug use and dual diagnosed children, and reported Regional Center staff has never come to provide training on dealing with clients with developmental disabilities or autism. Records reviewed indicate that 53 of 58 staff do not have current training in emergency interventions. Confidential interviews also demonstrate that clients are admitted frequently with substance use issues. While staff have received training on Narcan administration for clients, there has been no training provided on substance use and detection. As a result of the information obtained, documentation reviewed, confidential interviews conducted with staff and clients, the allegations that minors are being aggressive to another minor while in care, minor\u2019s behavior poses a risk to other minors, facility is out ratio, staff are not providing adequate supervision to minors, and staff do not meet the minimum qualifications required are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. Facility cited for Type A violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 84072(d): Personal Rights. The licensee shall ensure that each child, regardless of whether the child is in foster care, is accorded the personal rights specified in Welfare and Institutions Code section 16001.9, as applicable, including the right to live in a safe, healthy, and comfortable home where they are treated with respect. Investigation shows that the facility is not staffing the facility to the need of the clients in care to prevent assaults, altercations, or aggression towards other clients or when it is identified that the needs of clients are such that additional staff are warranted which poses an immediate health, safety or personal rights risk to the rights of clients to live in a safe and healthy environment as required by this regulation. Facility cited for Type A violation of Transitional Shelter Care Facilities, Interim Licensing Standards, Regulation 84665.5(b): Staff Ratios. Records review, confidential interviews with staff and clients indicate that the facility is not providing the care and supervision required including meeting the minimum staff ratios\n\nof one awake and on duty direct care staff present at the facility for ever four children present at the facility which poses an immediate risk to the safety of the clients in care at the facility. Facility cited for Type A violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 80078(a): Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Confidential interviews with staff and clients indicate that the facility is not providing the adequate supervision to clients in care including having sufficient staff persons on duty to provide supervision as needed. Confidential interviews with clients and staff reveal that staff do not have \u201cenough eyes\u201d to maintain supervision, cannot implement clients\u2019 coping skills including walkabouts, engage in age and developmentally appropriate activities with the varying ages and developmental needs of the clients in the cottages, or physically intervene in physical or aggressive behaviors, or other behaviors or inappropriate interactions observed due to lack of adequate staffing and staff training which poses an immediate risk to the clients in the care of the facility. Facility cited for Type A violation of Transitional Shelter Care Facilities, Interim Licensing Standards, Regulation 84665.3(b): Additional Staff Training. Records reviewed and interviews conducted indicate that staff have not received specialized training on the specialized needs of children in transition including clients accepted with developmental delays, mental health issues, behavioral health issues, violent tendencies, and aggression or substance use and detection, to name a few. Director states that training is needed in regards to drug use and dual diagnosis clients, and reported nobody from the Regional Center has ever come to provide training on dealing with clients with developmental disabilities or autism, which poses an immediate risk to the safety of the clients in care at the facility. Exit interview was conducted and documents were provided along with appeal rights to Ms. McCoy.\n\nstaff are notified and told to clean their cottages and additional staff go out to the cottages to ensure that they are meeting ratio. Confidential interviews of staff indicated that certain staff who are \u201cless vocal,\u201d tend to be selected to speak with Licensing. During an inspection to the facility on 10/14/22, Licensing received push back from facility supervisors when requesting staff contact information. As a result of confidential interviews conducted with staff and clients, the allegation that staff interfere with licensing inspections is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview conducted with Ms. McCoy and documentation provided to the facility.",

This incident was referred to Community Care Licensing Division's Investigations Branch for investigation and Investigator Melissa Weaver was assigned to investigate this incident. Confidential interviews conducted by Investigator Weaver confirmed that staff discovered C1 and C2 engaged in inappropriate sexual activity at the facility. Investigation revealed that S1 was informed by another youth in care about plans for C1 to go into C2's room and that S1 did enter C2's room and found the youth engaged in sexual acts. In addition, S2 reported to S1 that S2 observed C1 and C2 to be \"too close to one another\" during a movie at the facility prior to this incident. S1 was alleged to have had a conversation with C2 prior to the incident about C1 being \"a child\" but S1 failed to increase supervision and bed checks knowing the propensity of the youth in care. Additional staff interviews revealed that staff feel that they are not properly supervising youth at all times and that there are not enough staff during the graveyard shift. Additional interview with Ms. McCoy acknowledges that the facility is understaffed.

Confidential interviews revealed that staff made an inappropriate comment, while other interviews revealed that no staff ever talked down to C1 or made derogatory or inappropriate comments to C1.

LPA Segura conducted a follow up interview with the reporting party (RP) on 06/10/2020 at approximately 3pm where they re-iterated that the parents were not called every time C1 ran away. During the same call LPA requested phone records from the parents, which were not provided to LPA for review. The RP agreed to attempt and get phone records, LPA also provided email address. On 06/15/2020 LPA requested phone records from the facility. LPA received phone records from the facility on 06/30/2020. LPA reviewed the phone records and noted that C1 had runaway on several occasions and the parents were called on most occasions except two. LPA found that phone record for 11/16/2020 and 11/19/2020 do not show a call was made to either phone numbers listed for the parents. Note that the Run/Return checklist did indicate a call was made to the parents for the same dates. Based on the information obtained there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility failed to contact the responsible parties when C1 ran away from the facility. therefore, the above allegation is unsubsantiated, meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence. Appeal rights were provided and discussed with Linda Bourne. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report was emailed with a read receipt requested to acknowledge the report was received.",

During this interview, C1 told this LPA that S2 did say inappropriate comments but it was resolved in the meeting with the cottage supervisor (S3) and S2. Based on staff interviews conducted by LPA Ann Valenzuela and S2 on December 12, 2019, and LPA Raissi interviews with S2 on June 16, 2020, and S3 on June 16, 2020; C1 has a history of joking around and at times can be sensitive over comments made. Based on interviews with S2, S3, and CSW; C1 has a history of exaggerating claims. Based on interviews with two staff members (S1, S3) and one resident C2 (C2 interviewed on June 18, 2020), S2 has not made inappropriate comments. Interviews with S2 and C1 show that an inappropriate comment was made \u201cretarded\u201d; Therefore, the allegation is Substantiated. Based on interviews with S2, S3, and C1, the differences between S2 and C1 were resolved in a meeting and the outcome was not to joke with C1.

    "narrative": "information provided, stating the Junior\u2019s cottage had ants during the time C1 and C2 were placed in there. All witnesses corroborate ants would be in C2\u2019s bedroom and some witnesses also state ants were in the bathroom/shower of the cottage. SSSS states the facility has a pest control that serviced the facility in October, LPA was provided with invoice. However, all witnesses corroborated that C2 was moved rooms due to the continued ant problem in the cottage, specifically in C2's room. While CSW did not ever see the ants or hear about the ants directly from C1 and C2, CSW confirms she received notification from the facility that C2 was complaining of continued ant issue and was being moved to another room because of the ants. SSSS confirms ants were a problem at the end of 2020, however, states the ants were primarily in the yard/playground area a few steps away from the cottages, not in the cottage where C1 and C2 were placed. Still, the majority of witnesses confirm the presence of ants within the cottage even after pest control treatment. Based on confidential interviews, information gathered, and documents reviewed, the allegation that staff failed to keep the facility free from ants is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for the allegation. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Title 22, Division 6, chapter 1 of the California Code of Regulations section 80087 (a) (1): Buildings and Grounds. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were emailed to Ms. Linda Bourne for signature. Original signed report will be placed in facility file.\n\nuse the bathroom or ask for anything after lights go out in the cottage for bedtime. Additionally, it was reported that staff do not provide a variety of food and no alternative foods are offered to C2, so C2 goes hungry and has lost weight. Finally, it was reported that C1 and C2 are not allowed to have their own personal items brought by bio-mom to facility. While some witnesses state all of these allegations occurred as detailed, few details were provided. All other witness statements do not corroborate this information. Staff and CSW confirm that C1 and C2 never reported not being able to get water or use the restroom after lights out. Staff corroborate this does not occur, as children can always use the restroom or get water if needed. Both staff and CSW corroborate food is plentiful at the facility and that it was an adjustment for C1 and C2 as they are not used to eating healthier type foods. All witnesses corroborate that staff offer alternative meals and/or modify meals for C1 and C2. There is no documented evidence of weight loss for C2. All interviews corroborate that the facility required approval of items brought to the facility due to the risk of COVID-19. CSW and staff all confirm that C1 and C2 were able to receive personal items brought to them as long as they were approved by facility staff. Lastly, it was alleged that staff failed to seek timely medical attention for C1. Per SSSS, C1\u2019s ankle injury was assessed immediately. Other witnesses corroborate this information. While the facility nurse assessed injury as an ankle sprain, C1\u2019s bio-mom was not satisfied with the assessment made at the facility and called law enforcement to have C1 taken to emergency room to be assessed and treated. Witnesses corroborate that all necessary first aid steps and medical assessment steps were taken at the facility. Facility took immediate action and followed standard protocol. While a witness maintains these allegations occurred, they were unavailable for additional details. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that staff do not meet C1 and C2\u2019s needs and staff failed to seek timely medical attention for C1, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence.

Additionally, several witnesses corroborate that C2 and C3 would often play together, and at times would get upset at each other or frustrated and start pushing or hitting, but staff state this would occur in front of staff and children were quickly separated and redirected.

It was reported that C2 had visible scratches and bruises on C2\u2019s body from an incident on 11/16/20 when C3 pulled C2 off a slide. While a witness maintains this occurred and led to scratches and bruises on C2\u2019s body, staff maintain they witnessed the incident and had been supervising the playground area the entire time when this occurred. Several witnesses corroborate the injuries, but most witnesses corroborate that there was supervision at the time of these incidents and C3 was redirected. It was also alleged that C4 threw a hard brush at C1 and S2 did not intervene. While a witness maintains this occurred and resulted in C1 being injured, other witnesses all state the brush was not thrown at C1 but was thrown by C4 during a tantrum. Staff corroborate C1 was redirected to move to safer area and C4's behaviors were redirected. Finally, it was alleged that a staff spit on C2 and a staff swatted C1 and C2 on their bottoms. While one witness maintains this did occur, the witness was unable to provide details regarding the allegation. All other witnesses corroborate this never occurred. S1, S2, and CSW, also state C2 has a tendency to lie and make up allegations. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that lack of supervision resulted in C3 causing injury to C2 while in care, staff failed to protect C1 and C2 while in care, and staff handled C1 and C2 in a rough manner, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were emailed to Linda Bourne for signature. Signed report will be placed in facility file.",

Confidential interviews revealed ITL is a restrictive program that takes away client privileges such as participating in certain activities and the usual length of ITL is 3 days or 6 shifts (2 shifts per day). Confidential interviews revealed C1 was placed on ITL several times while placed at OCFC due to C1\u2019s aggressive and assaultive behavior. Confidential interviews revealed that ITL is a known disciplinary consequence for assaultive behavior and that during the 3 days of ITL clients must have good behavior for each day (or shift) to count, otherwise, ITL is extended for the period of time behavior is poor or can even start over. All interviews revealed there was no unfair discipline or treatment of C1 and some interviews further revealed C1 was also given opportunities to work off of ITL. Confidential interviews also revealed C1 would often say C1 was being targeted by staff if C1 received disciplinary consequences. CSW revealed C1 has a hard time understanding consequences and taking accountability for C1\u2019s actions. Furthermore, CSW had no concerns about staff inappropriately disciplining C1 and CSW had observed staff to be very patient with C1.

For the allegation of clients bringing weapons into the facility, confidential interviews revealed clients hide weapons outside of the facility to later retrieve. Conflicting interviews revealed staff use a metal detecting wand on the clients when they return from running away. Confidential interviews reported campus support staff do a perimeter check of the facility at least two times a day and if they find any weapons or drugs, they are confiscated. Lastly, for the allegation that the Facility is operating with insufficient staffing to meet the needs of children in care, confidential interviews revealed there have been a few times where there have not been enough staff in the cottage due to staff calling out or going to a meeting and calls are made to Campus Support or other cottages to see if they have additional staff to help in the cottage. Confidential interviews could not recall the dates or times there were not enough staff in the cottage. Confidential interviews and records reviewed did not provide a preponderance of evidence to prove or disprove the allegations that staff do not prevent children from using illegal drugs in the facility, staff do not prevent minors from bringing weapons into the facility, and the Facility is operating with insufficient staffing to meet the needs of children in care. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were reviewed with Jose Mendez, Senior Social Services Supervisor.

Evidence obtained from confidential interviews of three residents and one staff member, as well as review of facility file and related records, revealed one youth being sexual assaulted occurring while outside the facility during an attempt to recruit them into prostitution. Confidential statements revealed staff are trained on being observant of signs of sex trafficking and prostitution recruitment. Staff take an active trauma informed role in minimizing the impact on youth in care. Confidential interviews further revealed that facility staff made numerous attempts to prevent youth from interacting with sex trafficking youth and staff make continued attempts to discourage youth leaving the facility without permission. The investigation found a lack of evidence to support the allegation of facility staff\u2019s lack of supervision leading to sexual exploitation. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated. A finding that the allegation is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "On 11/21/2024 at approximately 9:00am Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tatyana Shulz conducted an Informal Meeting with the above facility for the purposes of initiating a conversation about the new changes happening at the facility. Present during the meeting was LPA Tatyana Shulz and Sarina Buchannan, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Rosa Rodriguez, Regional Manager (RM) Margo Castaneda, Clinical Supervisor Sydney Harkruiz and Executive Director Alyssum Maguire. Below is a summary of the topics that were discussed and the answers that were provided by the licensee: Follow up on the three staff members that were terminated. The three staff members were terminated as of 11/8/2024. Around that same time it was brought to the facilities attention that the previous assigned Administrator has family ties to one of the terminated staff members and has since resigned from their position as of 11/15/2024. An HR representative was also found to be related to several of the staff allowing for the hire of family members without the Executive Directors knowledge. Which caused the checks and balances of the hiring and internal complaint process to be ineffective. That HR representative has since been terminated from their position. Appointment of a new Administrator. LPA Shulz requested the facility provide the documentation needed in order to assign the prospective Administrator Ian Longue to the role. The facility has implemented four full-time lead staff. Three being a Lead I and one being a Lead II, with plans of making one Lead I a Lead II. With the Lead II position being able to provide audits for the Administrator and vice versa. Qualifications and duties that the role requires will be discussed in detail with Ian Longue, Alyssum Maguire and Sydney Harkruiz on 12/5/2024. Quarter Reports. LPA Shulz reiterated the dates that the Quarter Reports need to be submitted to Licensing and the critical details that need to be mentioned in those reports. Facility staff acknowledged the requirements and stated they would put those deadlines on their calendars for a swifter turn around time of said reports. LPA will send those due dates to the facility. Continue to LIC 809-C\n\nStaff hiring. When the three terminated staff were let go from their positions other staff members that were not directly involved in the incident have since decided to part ways with the facility. There is currently a new cohort of 6 staff members graduating on 11/22/2024 that are waiting for a certified trainer in CPI and Ukeru to conduct those training's before being allowed on the floor. Ian Longue is one of the staff members that is taking the training in order to become a CPI and Ukeru instructor. Facility population change (Children under 6). Progress Ranch is currently in the process of opening up another facility. In the new Plan of Operation for that home the population that they plan on serving will include children under 6. In order to keep siblings/families together, the facility plans on clearing the house any time a sibling set or parent and child dynamic is brought into the home. The current facility address for Progress Ranch will be relocating shortly due to the home owner selling the property. LPA will follow up on the relocation plans. The relocation has to be a new facility address. How will the facility operate moving forward? Moving forward the facility will begin to construct checks and balances in the scheduling by placing Lead II staff to cover front end and back end shifts allowing for a shift cross over which will keep all staff accountable. The Lead II will be available Sunday- Wednesday and Wednesday- Saturday for 7 day coverage instead of the previous 5 day coverage. They plan on implementing weekly training's every Wednesday. Yesterday on 11/20/2024, the facility had their first weekly training on boundaries, family relationships, and use of personal phones. If the staff cannot attend the training's for any reason that week, they will be recorded and staff will be made to watch them as early as possible. Upper management also plans on making more unannounced visits to the home which will allow for more face time with all staff. Lastly, staff plan on holding each other accountable for their actions and there will no longer be just one staff monitoring a client alone.",

Similarly, statements from interviewees were not consistent about whether facility staff yells at minors (for no good reason) or if particular staff-people were only trying to be firm in prompting or redirecting non-compliant clients. As for the facility taking a youth to emergency or urgent care, though the client\u2019s legal guardian ultimately did not agree that it was necessary, signed Consent to Treat or Medical Authorization forms were obtained by the facility; as such, it was within Progress Ranch\u2019s scope of authority to have the minor at least be evaluated\u2014however, the facility could have better communicated and/or collaborated with that minor\u2019s guardian. Regarding the transportation of a minor to extra curricular activities, there was enough indication that this had been done by the facility to a reasonable extent up until a point wherein the facility decided to not continue supporting the youth\u2019s attendance to after-school activities due to that client not being honest about what they actually wanted to do when they got to school. According to corroborating staff statements, the school and the facility were in agreement on discontinuing transportation for the youth to extra-curricular activities due to the safety risk involved (the youth would have effectively been unaccounted for because they were not doing what they stated they would or they would not be where they initially claimed they would be). Finally, not enough corroborating youth spoke to not being allowed to use a phone in the facility\u2014a number of staff and children did speak to a \u201clights out\u201d house rule in which phone use is restricted after a certain time at night to allow for quiet time and sleep throughout the facility. Overall, there were inconsistent statements throughout the investigation process and there were not enough witnesses to corroborate the allegations.

In addition, any staff aware of the allegation had been told by other staff or clients and did not witness the event them self. Also, the client who was allegedly hit informed their County Social Worker that the facility had conducted a restraint during this incident and the client did not like it but did not mention they were hit. Lastly, the County Social Worker stated it was difficult to get the client to leave the facility as they wanted to stay. LPA Buchannan was also informed of two additional incidents in which clients may have been physically abused at the facility. One incident took place on November 10, 2024, but LPA was unable to obtain any witnesses to corroborate the allegation. LPA was also unable to confirm with the client due to them refusing an interview. In addition, Facility Administrator and Executive Director stated that the client had hit their hand on a printer while engaging in destructive behaviors. Lastly, the County Social Worker confirmed the client was taken to the hospital following this event and there was no report of injury consistent with being physically abused. Another incident took place on December 4, 2024, in which a client had allegedly been choked by staff. LPA was able to confirm with staff who witnessed the incident stated that the staff conducting the restraints arm slipped due to the client moving a lot, this resulted in one arm being around the client\u2019s neck momentarily. Also, the incident was said to have been reported by the client and staff who witnessed it at a Child Family Team meeting, but the County Social Worker stated that it was never reported or addressed. Lastly, the witness stated they did not attend any CFT meeting regarding the incident, it was not reported, and the restraint was necessary to keep clients safe.

In attendance for this office conference are Jodean Hall, Licensing Program Manager, Alicia Berstein, Staff Services Manager I, Chadwyck Moore, System of Care Analyst, Ali Neira, Program Planner CPS, Alyssum Maguire, Executive Director, Kourtney Hamilton, Regional Residential Manager, Lisa Henry, Executive Assistant, Sydney Harkruiz, LCSW Clinical Supervisor, Sarah Mascardo, Mental Health Rehabilitation Specialist. LPA Hill addressed the following as part of the review of the application: LPA Hill started the conversation discussing with the facility about the accepting of children under the age of six into this six bed facility. LPA Hill advised the agency that per 84268.1 Intake Procedures for the Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Subchapter 2. Care for Children Under the Age of Six Years, the following is stated: \"A group home that cares for children under the age of six years shall not accept older children in the same family-like setting, unless the needs and services plan of a younger sibling recommends the presence of that older sibling.\" The facility shall work on updating and providing additional information for this population. LPA Hill also addressed the mention of the facility accepting minor parents into this facility. The Department is concerned that the program statement does not provide enough information about how the agency will provide appropriate supervision of the minor parent and their child and what services they would provide to the minor parent while at the facility. Training for the minor parent on bathing, dressing, diapering, feeding, care and supervision, etc.\n\nLPA Hill also addressed the agency's plan to accept youth that may have involvement with probation with the under six population, parenting minor population and/or youth that may have been initially removed from parent or guardian. The program statement and plan of operation needs to include how the facility plans to keep youth separated and safe while at the facility given the mixing of these populations. The program statement is not clear on how the facility will monitor these populations, if approved to have both at the same time, to ensure safety of all youth in care. LPA Hill also addressed the Neighborhood Complaint Policy to ensure that it articulates a name of an individual and phone number to be reached outside of the facility. Discussed were the following: * Staying consistent with the age of the population of the youth to be served. * Assessments and Safety Planning * Mental Health Program Approval and direct services being provided to youth in care. * House Rules and how the facility will ensure that the facility * Room disgnation for under six and crib locations. Facility corrections are to be received by the LPA Hill by December 5, 2024. LPA Hill shall also schedule the agency for the Component III. PreLicensing visit shall be scheduled for December 5, 2024 in person. End of document.",

During the investigation LPA Turner was informed that staff members took immediate steps to de escalate the situation between all the clients in care. The client in care was being argumentative and confrontational towards staff members causing the other clients in care to engage in a verbal dispute. Staff are aware of the tension between the clients in care and tried to prevent them from engaging in verbal and physical altercations. Staff members positioned themselves between the clients. Staff members sustained some injuries while trying to block and restrain clients in care. Lastly, during interviews LPA Turner was notified that the clients in care struggle to get along with each other and that staff take preventative measures to separate them during outings and provide them their own space so that they stay away from engaging in any altercations with each other. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

LPA was informed that there were 3 staff working on the day of the incident which was also confirmed by the staff schedule. During the time the incident took place, one staff had left to go to the office leaving the facility with 2 staff for the 4 clients present. While this was still in ratio, Case Managers had informed staff the day before that the client who was requesting medical care needed to have 2 staff present while being transported to preserve the safety of clients and staff. To transport the client requesting medical care, it would have meant the facility would be out of ratio. To ensure the client was given medical attention staff called an ambulance and it was confirmed that the client was taken to the hospital and received medical attention, this was an isolated incident.

However, on 03/06/2025 Community Care Licensing (CCL) reached out to the facility to inform them that a Guardian review found that there were staff who were still not cleared and associated to the facility but were providing care and supervision to clients in care. It was confirmed by CCL staff that there were 16 staff who did not have eligible clearances, and the provider was aware that 5 of those staff did not have clearances from the previous communication with CCL on 01/17/2025. LPA confirmed from a Guardian review that Staff 1 (S1) was on the schedule starting 01/13/2025 until 02/19/2025 but did not have an eligible clearance until 03/24/2025. Although LPA was informed that S1 was removed from the schedule and not allowed to work the floor on 02/19/2025, LPA Tatyana Shulz encountered S1 at the facility during their visit on 02/28/2025 despite not being on the schedule for that day. Therefore, it was confirmed S1 was providing care and supervision without a background clearance. In addition, Staff 2 (S2) was not background cleared until 04/03/2025 and the staff schedule shows that S2 started working with clients weekly starting from 02/19/2025 until 04/19/2025. Also, LPA Tatyana Shulz interviewed S2 on 02/28/2025 while at their visit prior to them having an eligible clearance. Staff 3 (S3) did not have an eligible background clearance until 03/26/2025 but the schedule shows S3 started working on 01/27/2025 through 04/19/2025. Staff 4, (S4) was not cleared until 03/26/2025 and was on the schedule from 01/13/2025 through 04/14/2025. Lastly, Staff 5 (S5) was put on the schedule on 01/30/2025 through 04/12/2025 and as of 06/26/2025, S5 does not have an eligible clearance.

LPA met with Administrator Cathi Johnson. LPA was given a tour of the interior and exterior areas of the facility's physical plant. The facility has three shared client bedrooms with each room having two beds and containing the required furnishings observed to be in good repair--additional drawer space for clients' personal belongings will be moved with the clients from the Sacramento Welcome Home - Hilltop House after licensure of this location. There is one shared full bathroom in the hallway off of which all of the client bedrooms are situated. There is an additional en suite full bathroom in one of the client bedrooms. All the bathrooms were in good repair, with toilets that flushed and fixtures that provided hot water that was within the required temperature range. Refrigerator and freezer units were all observed to be in good working condition. There is also sufficient storage space for dried good or non-perishable items. Also observed within two secured staff offices were lockable cabinets for confidential files and medications. There are securable cabinets in a designated staff bathroom where potentially hazardous cleaning agents and chemicals are to be stored appropriately--away from areas where food preparation is done. The thermostat read a temperature that was within the required range. The backyard was found to not have any potentially hazardous areas or items; the pathways are unobstructed.

The County has since assigned two new program supervisors to the SWH locations and is looking to fill a third supervisor position pending the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors\u2019 approval which is expected to pass on 11/05/2024, bringing the total number of program supervisors to five (currently, there are four). Regarding the plan to re-designate an administrator, it was noted that Alicia Wasklewics is set to go through the administrator training/certification at the end of this month (October, 2024). CCL clarified that the required facility manager designation is specific to each shift per House/location when children are present. Being that there are only four supervisors covering all the Houses, there are times when no supervisor is available at a given location. The County stated that they have implemented an assigned Worker of the Day or \u201cWOD\u201d to cover those locations and/or times when a program supervisor is not available. CCL requested that on the schedules (on the LIC 500 or Personnel Report) it is specified who the WODs and supervisors are and that those designated are spelled out as \u2018facility managers\u2019, that all other CCL-required positions are spelled out (including, for example, Administrator) under the \"Job Title,\" and that an updated form be submitted for each location by October 31, 2024. The County stated that some of the limitation(s) in properly reflecting these positions may be due to the need to have it cleared by the staff's union beforehand and that, relatedly, the same constraint(s) may be affecting the finalizing of job duty statements for care staff to acknowledge. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 2) Also discussed were the missing full or seven-day reports which are the follow-up reports to the County\u2019s 24-hour notifications. Per the County, management is paying close attention to the October reports to ensure compliance: the 24-hour reports are being done in a timely manner but the intermediate step involving a supervisor de-brief is where the reports are getting held up. The County are actively working on a pilot program set to start at the end of November or the beginning of December, 2024, which is meant to help track reports through a more automated system. It is CCL\u2019s expectation that the outstanding full or seven-day reports for previously-submitted 24-hour notifications (for September, 2024) will also be submitted to CCL by October 31, 2024\u2014the number of missing full or seven-day reports are as follows: Pasadena House \u2013 11; Madison - 27, and Chicago \u2013 10 (for a total of 48). It is also CCL\u2019s expectation that an immediate correction plan be put in place to be in compliance with Title 22 Regulations. Regarding training requirements\u2014specifically, Section 84065(i)(1)(D) which discusses the need for an assessment of the efficacy of training\u2014CCL noted, based on interviews, that direct-care staff may not have a sufficient understanding of the training topics covered despite having received the training. CCL advised that post-testing or return demonstrations to assess for competency may be developed by the County, themselves, so long as those assessments are documented in each staffer\u2019s file. The County stated that management will check-in with the supervisors about this protocol and also added that the supervisors do meet with their staff every month, are probably doing at least some type of performance evaluations, and that they may just need to do better at documenting. CCL is requesting an implementation plan to be compliant with Title 22 Regulations, and that this plan should be submitted by October 31, 2024. Additional training support: CCL advised that the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office only provides training on the Foster Youth Bill of Rights but not on anything more specific like medications, for example. CCL provided the Ombudsperson's Office portal and link to sign up for Bill of Rights training. The County asked if CCL, apart from the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office, provides more topic-specific training\u2014CCL advised that it does and that this training will be scheduled for the County by the end of November or the beginning of December, 2024. On the SWH Program Statement being made accessible to staff: the County stated that they are still working on the employee handbook\u2014along with this process the care staff have been given electronic access to the Title 22/Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Regulations digitally and parts of the Program Statement on which staff get trained. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 3) Regarding the POC for the Personal Rights citation on the Chicago House on inventory check/searches. The POC was submitted to CCL on 10/03/2024, this procedure is still under review by CCL. Regarding the POC for the Personal Rights citation on the Madison House, the County will check on the progress of training for staff which is expected to be completed by 10/11/2024. Regarding the POC for the overcapacity citation on the Pasadena House, this POC was submitted to CCL on 10/02/2024 and is still under review. A copy of this report is being emailed to the County for signature.",

County stated they will provide a copy of the training log highlighting staff who still need to complete this training. CCL requests this be submitted by 02/14/2025. CCL asked if security guards will receive restraint training. The County stated security guards will not be restraint trained and will not put hands on youth. Reporting Requirement Update: CCL discussed the continued issue of late and/or missing reports for all TSCF facilities. The County stated that their records are not consistent with CCL reported numbers and requested that CCL attach which reports are missing going forward. Increase of Unauthorized Absences: CCL discussed observation of increased unauthorized absences and asked how staff attempt to prevent youth from leaving. County shared that staff follow youth to the property perimeter line when leaving due to safety concerns. It was also stated staff ratios can determine if a youth is followed. CCL advised the county to include reason for not going further than property line on incident reports. Levi Huser from Systems of Care Branch offered an opportunity for collaboration to discuss ideas on reducing law enforcement contacts. LIC809 Office Meeting Review: Licensing Program Analyst and Licensing Program Manager will have a Teams Meeting with the County to review the LIC809 report for the monthly collaboration meeting each month in order for any revisions to be made immediately as necessary.

    "narrative": "On 01/14/2025 the CA Department of Social Services\u2019 (CDSS) Community Care Licensing Division (CCL) and the County of Sacramento held the monthly collaborative meeting over Microsoft Teams. The attendees were: from County, Cathi Johnson, Alondra Neira, Tashna Ward, Alicia Wasklewicz, and Veronica Carrillo, from CCL, Margo Castaneda, Jodean Hall, Rosa Rodriguez, Hillary Hall, Connie Goldie, Tina Thorn, Chad Cabigon, and from CDSS\u2019 System of Care Branch (SOC), Kelley Hartman, Levi Huser, and Alicia Bernstein. Topics discussed at the meeting were: What\u2019s working well: The County expressed having two TSCF\u2019s is much more manageable. They have also had a lower census on average as of late between the Welcome Home locations which has been helped by the recent capacity expansion through outside partners. Temporary move from Chicago House to Pasadena House: Due to an infestation of carpet beetles the facility is being fumigated. Designated Administrator: CCL noted that Alicia Wasklewicz passed the Administrator Exam; County was informed that Regional Manager (RM) Castaneda requested the expedited processing of Ms. Wasklewicz\u2019s administrator certification. CCL reiterated expectations for a facility administrator: to be on facility premises for the number of hours necessary to manage and administer the facility in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to be readily available for the responsibilities and oversight of the facilities. CCL also reiterated the need for staff to be designated to act on the administrator\u2019s behalf with the overall management of facilities in the administrator\u2019s absence. CCL emphasized that these designees also need to be able to provide Plans of Correction for citations issued during inspections\u2014County confirmed that these facility manager designees have been given this authority. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 2) Plan for Pasadena House license: The County will continue to keep the license until further notice. Training Requirements: Follow-Up: County will be sending the template for staff training. Security Guards \u2013 Fingerprint Clearance Needed: CCL advised that all security guards positioned in the home need to be fingerprinted and obtain criminal record clearances through Guardian due to the frequency, consistency, and recurring nature of their presence. The due date for the completion of fingerprinting is 01/31/2025. Reporting Requirement Update \u2013 Incident Reporting CCL discussed the continued issue of late and/or missing reports and acknowledged it is vastly improving. County stated that they are continuing to address this and with Ms. Wasklewicz as administrator, her presence in the Houses more frequently should help address the reporting. The County also expects to start testing the SMILE system this week with the goal of launching in the end of February. Inventory Check/Searches: CCL followed up on the submission of the County\u2019s Prudent Parenting activation form related to searches for CCL to review. The County will be submitting the form. CCL/SOC pointed out that Prudent Parenting is usually in reference to decisions that a substitute caregiver makes to afford youth something that resembles a more \u201cnormal\u201d way of life such as allowing youth to participate in certain activities without prior approval from their authorized representative. SOC discussed that the Prudent Parent Standard is a general framework through which providers can respond as necessary to help support youth, but it might not always be appropriate, and its use should depend on the population and/or individual youth in question. Facility Overview: Both LPAs stated seeing an increase in engagement between youth and staff participating in various house activities. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 3) Additional feedback: SOC reminded County of standing offer to provide consultation and guidance and encouraged County to reach out, as necessary. Training materials have been sent to County from SOC that may be helpful and could be integrated in the Shelter\u2019s program. County to submit Program Statement updates by 01/31/2025, to include clarification on the mandated initial vs. annual training, as well as policies and expectations related to contracted security personnel who work onsite at the SWH locations. Closing discussion on restraints: The County stated that all staff will start Phase 2 of the TCI training in February, 2025, and that they anticipate completion in March, 2025. CCL advised that a manual restraint should only be executed by a trained staff and should only be resorted to in a health and safety consideration for a child or staff, that it is more about good training that truly helps staff be proactive with early interventions, how to identify early on what the specific youth\u2019 triggers are, and how staff can equip themselves with enough techniques to de-escalate a situation. Additionally, it should also be helpful for the County to be familiar with the temperament and tendencies of their direct-care personnel so as to better inform management on staffing decisions and training considerations.

    "narrative": "On 12/10/2024, Community Care Licensing (CCL) and the County of Sacramento held the monthly Sacramento Welcome Home (SWH) TSCF (Temporary Shelter Care Facility) collaborative meeting over Microsoft Teams. In attendance from the County were: Cathi Johnson, Ali Neira, Alicia Wasklewicz,, and Veronica Carrillo. Attending from CCL: Margo Castaneda, Regional Manager (RM), Rosa Rodriguez, Licensing Program Manager (LPM), Jodean Hall, LPM, Hillary Hall, LPM, Connie Goldie, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Tina Thorn (LPA), and Chad Cabigon, LPA. Also present was Kelley Hartman and Alicia Bernstein from Systems of Care (SOC.) After introductions, the following was discussed: The County and CCL acknowledged what has been going well for them and for each facility. The County noted that operating two rather than three homes has been going well. CCL shared that all three locations were reported to have had great communication and LPAs have observed staff engaging with the youth. Alicia Wasklewics passed the Administrator Certification test and completed her background clearance. An expedited request will be sent by RM once paperwork is submitted. County plans to hire one more staff to meet the goal of having six supervisors. The LIC 500 will reflect a Worker of the Day (WOD), who meets Facility Manager qualifications. WOD will be present when a supervisor is not. There will be a WOD at each house during each shift. The County agreed to send a list of qualified facility managers for each facility as well as the staff schedules. The LIC 500 is to be sent to CCL by 12/11/24.\n\nCCL shared the staff training records submitted do not match the Program Statement and clarity is needed on the initial training versus annual training. The County said they would revise their program statement training requirements. CCL addressed a recent Incident Report (IR) involving a manual restraint. The County stated that while all staff are in the process of restrain training, restraints will always be a last resort. The County used the information provided by CCL regarding medication training and Personal Rights to create a self-paced training for the staff. The County has implemented information from the medication training and incorporated the new MARS form. The County is developing a staff training template and will send updated staff training records by 12/11/24. CCL requested information on the security guards at the facilities and the lack of security personnel mentioned in their Program Statement. CCL requested the security complete training on mandated reporting and Trauma Informed Care. CCL requested updates to the Program Statement on how the security is Trauma Informed and their level of engagement with staff and clients. Due date for Program Statement Update: January 11, 2025 CCL shared incident reporting by the County has improved in timeliness. The County is developing a system to track Incident Reports. Until development is complete, the County supervisor has created a schedule to review IRs. Monitoring Youth personal property and conducting searches was discussed. The County agreed to update the program statement to reflect and describe the Youth personal property log. The County will send CCL the Prudent Parent Activation form and Youth Care and Goal Plan. Inventories, not searches, are currently being conducted. The County explained that the inventory checks are a case-by-case. CCL recommended that the Youth Care and Goal Plan have an area in which client\u2019s history of substance use should be included to better predict the use of Prudent Parent Activation. The County provided updates on their Home-Based Shelter Program, which is near capacity. Next Meeting schedule for January 14, 2025.",

    "narrative": "One youth was listed on the placement roster as having been at the Sacramento Welcome Home- Madison facility for about one month, with extended absences during that time. When the youth exited placement at Madison, personal items were reported as missing. The youth had been placed at a different facility for several months prior to Madison and some of their personal property had been documented as left behind at this location. The youth did not provide details regarding personal property missing from Madison. The county social worker and CASA Worker believed all the youth\u2019s personal property from Madison had been retrieved and that photos were taken of those items. However, there were no records to match the items reported missing, and whether they were not safeguarded by Madison, or if these were the items missing from the prior placement. Case notes for Y1 indicate that during the 4 days that Y1 was enrolled in school, rides were offered. Y1 attended school on 3 of 4 days. On one day youth missed a ride with the Family Service Worker who arrived earlier to take youth to school. By the time youth got up there was no transportation available. When Y1 got up later in the morning Y1 would yell at staff about staff not waking Y1 up, however case notes indicate that staff attempted to wake youth on all 4 days. Case notes also indicate that a Family Service Worker was assigned to take Y1 to school on each day of enrollment. Based on LPA\u2019s interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegation are UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and appeal rights were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.",

Both the county and CCL reported on what\u2019s going well: Alicia Wasklewicz collaborated with Systems of Care representative and obtained resources and expressed gratitude for the connection. LPAs for each facility reiterated that the staff have been engaged with clients and responsive to LPAs. LPA Goldie reported on progress with Program Statement Review. LPA stated that she was able to access forms easily. LPA also stated that most of the revisions were a matter of gaining clarification, requesting transcripts, and having County provide more explanation regarding how the processes will be implemented. LPA Goldie gave a briefing on revision requests, namely the under 6 and discipline policies and of requesting transcripts for staff to ensure requirements are met. The County expressed that obtaining transcripts is proving to be a longer process depending on the time frame in which the staff took the required courses. The incident report submission process was discussed, with the county\u2019s new system, SMILE being implemented 03.17.25. C. Johnson explained that the county\u2019s new system should reduce the reporting time frame by providing email alerts to submit required reports and will provide more reminders to support staff. Continued 809C\n\nThe county was informed that, going forward, they will be cited if incident reports are turned in late. CCL shared information about our Technical Support Program that will provide support and training for the facility. T. Ward reported 12 staff are fully trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI). There are still staff needing to be trained. It was reported that enough staff are trained to ensure there are 2 people per shift available to do restraints if necessary. The expectation is that all staff are trained by April 1, 2025. County reported that on March 22, 2025, Foster Hope is set to take over operations at the current Madison House. Youth will move to Pasadena and Chicago House to allow Foster Hope to get situated. The County expressed a desire to keep Pasadena House as a home to relocate youth if Chicago House needs to be evacuated for emergency reason or if something needs to be fixed at Chicago House. It was also expressed that Chicago House may be used to conduct staff training and/or for youth visitation when needed and if not occupied by youth. SOC asked if County wanted their harm reduction policies/forms reviewed. A. Bernstein provided email address to the County. Regional Manager M. Castaneda concluded the meeting after offering time for more questions or comments.",

    "narrative": "On 08/16/2024, at 12:10 PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Connie Goldie conducted a visit to the facility for the purpose of a Case Management visit relating to the Post Licensing inspections completed on 07/31/2024 and 08/07/2024. LPA met with staff listed above who assisted with this inspection. LPA Goldie discussed issues observed during Post licensing inspections completed on dates listed above, LPA Goldie observed the following during the physical plant inspection: Upon arrival on 07/31/2024, LPA observed three staff playing cards at the kitchen table. Three clients in care were in their bedrooms. Additionally, on 08/07/2024, LPA observed a client sleeping on the couch in the living room area. Outside, assorted garbage including a water bottle, perfume bottle, paper plates and food wrappers on lawn adjacent to bedroom was observed. Staff stated clients just toss garbage out of their bedroom windows. LPA discussed that it needs to be picked up. A gate door, observed to be broken, was leaning up against the chain link fence on the back right corner of the property. In the kitchen, a cabinet door was missing. Staff stated work orders have been placed for these items to be repaired. Bedroom number 3 was barricaded with a bed pushed up to the door on both dates listed above. On 07/31/2024, Staff, S3 stated that they were unaware if staff or youth placed the bed to block the doorway. LPA stated that the bed needed to be moved as the bedroom needs to be accessible. On 08/07/2024, staff (S7) entered the window of bedroom number 3 and moved furniture to make bedroom accessible as required as it was again found to be barricaded. The mattresses in bedrooms one, two and three were observed to have worn bedsprings and unclean mattresses. Linens as required were not observed on any of the beds either. There was no activity calendar available for the summer and a client (C5) stated during interview that there were no activities available in the home. The First Aid kit was observed to be missing the first aid manual, scissors, antiseptic solution and adhesive tape. LPA requested staff records on both dates and staff were unable to provide files. Continued on LIC809C\n\nChildren\u2019s records were observed to be incomplete. Placement agreements were unavailable in children\u2019s files. Assessments were unsigned. Personal rights forms were unsigned by C2 and C4, consent forms for medical were missing for C2, C3 and C5. All clients did not have cash resource logs. No Medication Administration Records (MARS) were present for August 2024. The acting supervisor was unaware of medication policy and procedures according to regulation and stated training had not been provided. Medication count verifications are not being completed. There was no way for LPA to determine if medication is being dispensed as prescribed due to no documentation available (MARS and PMARS) Clients did have personal property inventories but not cash resource records. The facility does not adhere to reporting requirements per regulation. Thirty plus 7 day written reports have been submitted late and the Department is not consistently receiving 10-day weekly reports as required. Staff S4, S5 stated that all clients who return from unauthorized absences are refused entry until they are searched for contraband. If youth refuse to be searched, staff will call law enforcement. This is considered to be an unreasonable search as it is not being assessed on an individualized basis. One Technical Advisory is being given today. This is not a deficiency. Sixteen Title 22 California Code of Regulation and two Interim Licensing Standards citations are being issued today. (See LIC809D forms) An exit interview was conducted with Program Planner, Ali Neira via telephone who assisted with the plan of correction piece for deficiencies. A copy of this report along with appeal rights were discussed and provided to the facility. * Liz Jones signed on behalf of La Shon Tate as directed.",

    "narrative": "On 10/08/2024 Community Care Licensing (CCL) and the County of Sacramento held the monthly Sacramento Welcome Home (SWH) TSCF (Temporary Shelter Care Facility) collaborative meeting over Microsoft Teams. In attendance were Cathi Johnson, Ali Neira, Alicia Wasklewics, and Tashna Ward from the County and, from CCL, Rosa Rodriguez, Jodean Hall, Hillary Hall, Connie Goldie, and Chad Cabigon. After introductions, the following was covered: CCL acknowledged and thanked the County for the submission of its Written Plan, received by CCL on 09/25/2024, in response to the items covered during the first collaborative meeting held on 09/10/2024. The County has since assigned two new program supervisors to the SWH locations and is looking to fill a third supervisor position pending the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors\u2019 approval which is expected to pass on 11/05/2024, bringing the total number of program supervisors to five (currently, there are four). Regarding the plan to re-designate an administrator, it was noted that Alicia Wasklewics is set to go through the administrator training/certification at the end of this month (October, 2024). CCL clarified that the required facility manager designation is specific to each shift per House/location when children are present. Being that there are only four supervisors covering all the Houses, there are times when no supervisor is available at a given location. The County stated that they have implemented an assigned Worker of the Day or \u201cWOD\u201d to cover those locations and/or times when a program supervisor is not available. CCL requested that on the schedules (on the LIC 500 or Personnel Report) it is specified who the WODs and supervisors are and that those designated are spelled out as \u2018facility managers\u2019, that all other CCL-required positions are spelled out (including, for example, Administrator) under the \"Job Title,\" and that an updated form be submitted for each location by October 31, 2024. The County stated that some of the limitation(s) in properly reflecting these positions may be due to the need to have it cleared by the staff's union beforehand and that, relatedly, the same constraint(s) may be affecting the finalizing of job duty statements for care staff to acknowledge. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 2) Also discussed were the missing full or seven-day reports which are the follow-up reports to the County\u2019s 24-hour notifications. Per the County, management is paying close attention to the October reports to ensure compliance: the 24-hour reports are being done in a timely manner but the intermediate step involving a supervisor de-brief is where the reports are getting held up. The County are actively working on a pilot program set to start at the end of November or the beginning of December, 2024, which is meant to help track reports through a more automated system. It is CCL\u2019s expectation that the outstanding full or seven-day reports for previously-submitted 24-hour notifications (for September, 2024) will also be submitted to CCL by October 31, 2024\u2014the number of missing full or seven-day reports are as follows: Pasadena House \u2013 11; Madison - 27, and Chicago \u2013 10 (for a total of 48). It is also CCL\u2019s expectation that an immediate correction plan be put in place to be in compliance with Title 22 Regulations. Regarding training requirements\u2014specifically, Section 84065(i)(1)(D) which discusses the need for an assessment of the efficacy of training\u2014CCL noted, based on interviews, that direct-care staff may not have a sufficient understanding of the training topics covered despite having received the training. CCL advised that post-testing or return demonstrations to assess for competency may be developed by the County, themselves, so long as those assessments are documented in each staffer\u2019s file. The County stated that management will check-in with the supervisors about this protocol and also added that the supervisors do meet with their staff every month, are probably doing at least some type of performance evaluations, and that they may just need to do better at documenting. CCL is requesting an implementation plan to be compliant with Title 22 Regulations, and that this plan should be submitted by October 31, 2024. Additional training support: CCL advised that the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office only provides training on the Foster Youth Bill of Rights but not on anything more specific like medications, for example. CCL provided the Ombudsperson's Office portal and link to sign up for Bill of Rights training. The County asked if CCL, apart from the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office, provides more topic-specific training\u2014CCL advised that it does and that this training will be scheduled for the County by the end of November or the beginning of December, 2024. On the SWH Program Statement being made accessible to staff: the County stated that they are still working on the employee handbook\u2014along with this process the care staff have been given electronic access to the Title 22/Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Regulations digitally and parts of the Program Statement on which staff get trained. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 3) Regarding the POC for the Personal Rights citation on the Chicago House on inventory check/searches. The POC was submitted to CCL on 10/03/2024, this procedure is still under review by CCL. Regarding the POC for the Personal Rights citation on the Madison House, the County will check on the progress of training for staff which is expected to be completed by 10/11/2024. Regarding the POC for the overcapacity citation on the Pasadena House, this POC was submitted to CCL on 10/02/2024 and is still under review. A copy of this report is being emailed to the County for signature.",

    "narrative": "The Department investigated the allegation, \u201cStaff are not properly trained.\u201d Two of five staff members interviewed stated they were behind on training. One staff stated they did not receive initial training upon hire. Record review of staff training log and program statement indicates that 10 of 11 staff have not received initial 90 day required training. Five of the staff have not completed Mandatory Reporting training. Six staff have not completed the De-escalation training. Therefore, the evidence supports that this allegation is substantiated. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5 , 84065 Personnel Requirements (i)(3) are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.\u201d An exit interview was conducted. A copy of all reports and appeal rights were discussed and provided to facility staff, Name, TITLE.\n\nThe Department investigated the allegation. \u201cStaff are denying minors mental health treatment.\u201d Two of two clients interviewed stated mental health services have been offered to them. Five of five staff corroborate that outside vendors come into the facility to offer support services to the clients in care and mental health services are offered to the youth during their initial Child and Family Team meetings. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the allegations occurred or not. Based on the investigation, the records reviewed, and the interviews conducted, the complaint finding is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. In regard to the allegation, staff are not providing a safe environment for minors in care, both clients interviewed stated they feel safe in the facility. One client stated that staff help when kids are yelling by talking to them. Regarding the arrest alleged by the reporting party, upon review, this did not occur at this location. A supervisor of the facility stated there have been no arrests of clients for altercations between clients. And record review of incident reports supports this statement. Five of five staff corroborate the facility is safe. Statements by staff include \u201cwe engage with youth to keep them safe\u201d, \u201cwe set up the environment to be safe\u201d, \u201cwe keep others safe by directing them away from escalated youth\u201d, and \u201csafety checks are conducted every thirty minutes.\u201d Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the allegation occurred or not.

    "narrative": "The Department investigated the allegation, \u201cFacility is in disrepair.\u201d During the physical plant inspection conducted on 10/24/2025, LPA observed a broken cabinet above washer and dryer which S1 stated had been broken since August 2024. LPA observed garage door exit to the backyard to have two pieces of plywood hammered on the outside making the door inaccessible. S1 stated the plywood was applied on 10/19/2024 by facility maintenance and it was estimated to be replaced in 2-3 weeks. Additionally, cloth storage space drawers for clients were visibly soiled in bedrooms #1 and #2. During a subsequent visit on 12/18/2024, LPA observed that garage exit door was still not repaired, and plywood pieces were still present. Therefore, this allegation is substantiated. Based on LPA\u2019s observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 7, 80087(a) Buildings and Grounds are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D. Regarding the allegation, \u201cStaff are not safeguarding residents\u2019 belongings\u201d, a youth, C3, stated their belongings were placed outside including a laptop, clothing, two backpacks and brushes, due to head lice and were unable to be accessed for a week or two. Three staff corroborated that these belongings were placed outside for this reason. A laptop requires being secured to be safeguarded. Record review of program statement indicates that belongings not in youth\u2019s possession are stored in the garage. Based on LPA\u2019s observations and interviews which were conducted and record reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 3 80026 Safeguards for Cash Resources, Personal Property and Valuables of Residents are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of all reports and appeal rights were provided to the facility.\n\nRegarding the allegation, \u201cA youth displayed inappropriate sexual behavior in front of another youth\u201d, two clients declined to be interviewed. Six of six staff interviewed stated they were unaware of any youth masturbating in front of another youth in the home. Therefore, due to clients\u2019 refusal to be interviewed, it is not possible to determine whether the allegation occurred or not. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur; therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of all reports and appeal rights were provided to the facility.",

    "narrative": "On 01/14/2025 the CA Department of Social Services\u2019 (CDSS) Community Care Licensing Division (CCL) and the County of Sacramento held the monthly collaborative meeting over Microsoft Teams. The attendees were: from County, Cathi Johnson, Alondra Neira, Tashna Ward, Alicia Wasklewicz, and Veronica Carrillo, from CCL, Margo Castaneda, Jodean Hall, Rosa Rodriguez, Hillary Hall, Connie Goldie, Tina Thorn, Chad Cabigon, and from CDSS\u2019 System of Care Branch (SOC), Kelley Hartman, Levi Huser, and Alicia Bernstein. Topics discussed at the meeting were: What\u2019s working well: The County expressed having two TSCF\u2019s is much more manageable. They have also had a lower census on average as of late between the Welcome Home locations which has been helped by the recent capacity expansion through outside partners. Temporary move from Chicago House to Pasadena House: Due to an infestation of carpet beetles the facility is being fumigated. Designated Administrator: CCL noted that Alicia Wasklewicz passed the Administrator Exam; County was informed that Regional Manager (RM) Castaneda requested the expedited processing of Ms. Wasklewicz\u2019s administrator certification. CCL reiterated expectations for a facility administrator: to be on facility premises for the number of hours necessary to manage and administer the facility in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to be readily available for the responsibilities and oversight of the facilities. CCL also reiterated the need for staff to be designated to act on the administrator\u2019s behalf with the overall management of facilities in the administrator\u2019s absence. CCL emphasized that these designees also need to be able to provide Plans of Correction for citations issued during inspections\u2014County confirmed that these facility manager designees have been given this authority. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 2) Plan for Pasadena House license: The County will continue to keep the license until further notice. Training Requirements: Follow-Up: County will be sending the template for staff training. Security Guards \u2013 Fingerprint Clearance Needed: CCL advised that all security guards positioned in the home need to be fingerprinted and obtain criminal record clearances through Guardian due to the frequency, consistency, and recurring nature of their presence. The due date for the completion of fingerprinting is 01/31/2025. Reporting Requirement Update \u2013 Incident Reporting CCL discussed the continued issue of late and/or missing reports and acknowledged it is vastly improving. County stated that they are continuing to address this and with Ms. Wasklewicz as administrator, her presence in the Houses more frequently should help address the reporting. The County also expects to start testing the SMILE system this week with the goal of launching in the end of February. Inventory Check/Searches: CCL followed up on the submission of the County\u2019s Prudent Parenting activation form related to searches for CCL to review. The County will be submitting the form. CCL/SOC pointed out that Prudent Parenting is usually in reference to decisions that a substitute caregiver makes to afford youth something that resembles a more \u201cnormal\u201d way of life such as allowing youth to participate in certain activities without prior approval from their authorized representative. SOC discussed that the Prudent Parent Standard is a general framework through which providers can respond as necessary to help support youth, but it might not always be appropriate, and its use should depend on the population and/or individual youth in question. Facility Overview: Both LPAs stated seeing an increase in engagement between youth and staff participating in various house activities. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 3) Additional feedback: SOC reminded County of standing offer to provide consultation and guidance and encouraged County to reach out, as necessary. Training materials have been sent to County from SOC that may be helpful and could be integrated in the Shelter\u2019s program. County to submit Program Statement updates by 01/31/2025, to include clarification on the mandated initial vs. annual training, as well as policies and expectations related to contracted security personnel who work onsite at the SWH locations. Closing discussion on restraints: The County stated that all staff will start Phase 2 of the TCI training in February, 2025, and that they anticipate completion in March, 2025. CCL advised that a manual restraint should only be executed by a trained staff and should only be resorted to in a health and safety consideration for a child or staff, that it is more about good training that truly helps staff be proactive with early interventions, how to identify early on what the specific youth\u2019 triggers are, and how staff can equip themselves with enough techniques to de-escalate a situation. Additionally, it should also be helpful for the County to be familiar with the temperament and tendencies of their direct-care personnel so as to better inform management on staffing decisions and training considerations. A copy of this report is being provided to the County of Sacramento.",

Both the county and CCL reported on what\u2019s going well: Alicia Wasklewicz collaborated with Systems of Care representative and obtained resources and expressed gratitude for the connection. LPAs for each facility reiterated that the staff have been engaged with clients and responsive to LPAs. LPA Goldie reported on progress with Program Statement Review. LPA stated that she was able to access forms easily. LPA also stated that most of the revisions were a matter of gaining clarification, requesting transcripts, and having County provide more explanation regarding how the processes will be implemented. LPA Goldie gave a briefing on revision requests, namely the under 6 and discipline policies and of requesting transcripts for staff to ensure requirements are met. The County expressed that obtaining transcripts is proving to be a longer process depending on the time frame in which the staff took the required courses. The incident report submission process was discussed, with the county\u2019s new system, SMILE being implemented 03.17.25. C. Johnson explained that the county\u2019s new system should reduce the reporting time frame by providing email alerts to submit required reports and will provide more reminders to support staff. Continued 809C\n\nThe county was informed that, going forward, they will be cited if incident reports are turned in late. CCL shared information about our Technical Support Program that will provide support and training for the facility. T. Ward reported 12 staff are fully trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI). There are still staff needing to be trained. It was reported that enough staff are trained to ensure there are 2 people per shift available to do restraints if necessary. The expectation is that all staff are trained by April 1, 2025. County reported that on March 22, 2025, Foster Hope is set to take over operations at the current Madison House. Youth will move to Pasadena and Chicago House to allow Foster Hope to get situated. The County expressed a desire to keep Pasadena House as a home to relocate youth if Chicago House needs to be evacuated for emergency reason or if something needs to be fixed at Chicago House. It was also expressed that Chicago House may be used to conduct staff training and/or for youth visitation when needed and if not occupied by youth. SOC asked if County wanted their harm reduction policies/forms reviewed. A. Bernstein provided email address to the County. Regional Manager M. Castaneda concluded the meeting after offering time for more questions or comments.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill conducted an unannounced case management inspection on 5/1/25 at 2:10 PM and met with Danielle Chan, Engagement Supervisor. LPA Hill discussed with Ms. Chan and incident that is still pending completion regarding an incident dated 2/12/25 in which the agency's security guard restrained a child in care at the facility. LPA Hill conducted interviews and obtained additional information regarding efforts made by Sacramento County in this ongoing investigation as well. This investigation is still ongoing at this time. While at the facility, LPA Hill learned that there are seven children present in the facility but the facility is only licensed to provide care and supervision for no more than six children at this location. LPA Hill was made aware that there is a sibling set of four that were admitted on 4/25/25, and three other clients have been in the facility more than ten days. LPA Hill cited the facility per Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations Chapter 1, General Licensing Requirements, Section 80010(a) Limitations on Capacity & Ambulatory Status as the facility is not to operate beyond their licensed capacity which is six at this location. LPA Hill informed Ms. Chan that the facility cannot operate beyond the conditions and limitations specified on the license. Exit interview was conducted and the citation, along with the appeal rights were provided to Ms. Chan.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation, \u201cStaff did not ensure that the facility was free of pest in a timely manner,\u201d seven of nine confidential interviews stated that pest concerns were not initially handled efficiently. Record review of documentation indicates C1 and C2 were treated for bug bites on 01/01/2025 and 1/10/2025. After learning a potential bed bug exposure occurred on 01/02/2025, staff did look for evidence of bugs present but did not observe presence of pests. According to documentation, staff did not take preventative steps until 01/10/2025 after another child received bites. On 01/12/2025, Orkin Pest Control was contacted and observed the presence of bed bugs and beetles on 01/13/2025 and the youth were evacuated the same day to another location. The shelter was fumigated. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6 & Chapter 1, 800879(a)(1) Buildings and Grounds are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.\u201d An exit interview was conducted. A copy of all reports and appeal rights were provided to the facility.\n\nThe Department investigated the allegation, \u201cStaff are providing unnecessary searches of minors.\u201d Five of nine confidential interviews stated inventory checks are requested but, youth can refuse to comply. Two of nine interviewed stated youth are not allowed inside until an inventory check is completed. Due to inconsistent statements made corroboration was unable to be reached. Regarding allegation \u201cStaff did not safeguard belongings\u201d it was alleged that a youth\u2019s belongings were placed outside in trash bags that were not fully closed, leaving them exposed to the elements and damp conditions. Confidential interviews did not corroborate that this occurred. One of six youth interviewed stated their stuff was put outside but, then taken by a staff to have professionally cleaned. Another stated that they didn\u2019t know what was done with their stuff and a third stated staff placed their belongings in a bag in the garage. One of five staff stated clothing was laundered professionally the day youth vacated the home so it could be treated. The Department investigated the allegation, \u201cFacility\u2019s washer is in disrepair.\u201d Two of nine confidential interviews stated washing machine was broken In January. One interviewee stated it was broken for 2-3 weeks in January 2025. One stated they were unsure if washer was broken. It was stated that a laundering service picked up laundry while the washer was out of service once a week. It is unknown if a request was made for repair of the washing machine prior to 01/10/2025. Based on record review, the washing machine was reported to be broken on 01/10/2025 and a new one was ordered the same day and delivered to the facility on 01/14/2025. Although these allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.\u201d An exit interview was conducted.

    "narrative": "On 05/13/2025 the Sacramento Regional Office of Community Care Licensing\u2019s (CCL) Children\u2019s Residential Program and the Sacramento County Department of Child, Family, and Adult Services (DCFAS) held the monthly Temporary Shelter Care Facility (TSCF) collaborative meeting over the Teams platform. In attendance were Margo Castaneda, Jodean Hall, Rosa Rodriguez, Connie Goldie, Chad Cabigon, Sarina Buchannan, Zaria Turner, Cathi Johnson, Ali Neira, Alicia Wasklewicz, Tashna Ward, and Veronica Carrillo. The following items with respect to the Sacramento Welcome Home (SWH) locations were discussed: What\u2019s Working Well: Both the County and CCL stated there is much more collaboration going on which has been very beneficial. SMILE has made a huge impact on getting IRs timelier. Alicia Wasklewicz has made a tremendous impact being at the homes. Provisional License: CCL informed the County that the provisional status of the Pasadena and Chicago Houses will be extended to 11/30/2025\u2014the updated licenses will be provided to the County shortly. Under 6 Program Statement: CCL informed the county that the review of the Under 6 program statement is in progress and requested access to few more documents the LPA was not able to open. Request granted during the meeting. Incident Reports: The SMILE system has been a big success. County is still working on a few inconsistencies and duplication of reports. The county will reinforce to the staff the policy of IRs. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\nHarm Reduction: As previously stated, any harm reduction plan must be approved by CCL before its implementation. It was also discussed that the harm reduction plan must be specific per youth, and CCL recommended that County reach out to the SOC (System of Care) Branch and to the case carrying LPA and their Licensing Program Manager for collaboration. Unauthorized Absence: County clarified that after four hours of a youth being gone, they pack up their belongings for safe-keeping. County explained that the runaway youth does not necessarily lose their bed if another youth comes into the facility unless that youth tells the facility beforehand that they do not plan to return within 24 hours. County also shared that they continue working on having direct-care staff be more consistent about following youth to the end of the Homes\u2019 property lines when clients elope. Reporting Requirement 10-day overstay: By way of reminder, CCL requests County include both the assigned LPA and the LPM (Licensing Program Manager) when sending out the overstay reports. Over-Capacity: County shared part of the challenge has been that their TSCF-partner providers may refuse to accept youth for staffing reasons or due to the level of care and/or compatibility concerns for certain cases. County explained they are working with other providers for additional locations. Another obstacle is when placement is found for the youths but they refuse. Restraint Training: County explained that there is a small group that needed to re-take a required test before transitioning to the next phase causing a delay. By the end of today, the Administrator will be sending a list of fully trained staff and/or a scheduling plan that shows at least two staff per shift are certified to utilize manual restraints if needed. County reiterated its aversion to staff applying restraints on youth and has come up with a Best Practice Acknowledgement form that they are requiring staff to sign before staff are cleared to use such interventions\u2014these forms are being sent out starting this week. CCL asked if County can identify any additional support that CCL can provide; no other items were discussed at this time. A copy of this report is being provided to the County.",

The initial inspection was related to an incident report dated February 12, 2025, in which C1 was restrained by a security guard (SG) contracted by the Licensee and S1. LPA Hill conducted interviews with direct care staff at the facility, a representative of the security agency, and an Engagement Supervisor as part of this investigation. LPA Hill did attempt to reach out to SG but was not able to obtain contact information due to the security company indicating they would not provide SG's information until the Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS) completed their investigation and review . LPA Hill did attempt to obtain additional information from BSIS but it was not available. Interviews conducted with the Sacramento County staff working in the facility indicate that at the time of the incident, S1 was not trained to provide manual restraints or provide restraint assistance at the facility and should not have physically engaged. As a result of the case management inspections conducted February 12, 2025 and May 1, 2025, the agency was cited per Title 22 Regulation Section 84365(a) Emergency Intervention Staff Training as no facility personnel are to use emergency intervention techniques, including manual restraints on a child unless the training instructor has certified in writing that the facility personnel have successfully completed the emergency intervention training. S1 had not completed the required training and the instructor had not certified it was completed at the time of the restraint. **Continued**\n\nIn questioning the role and training for security guards in the facility, it was indicated that security guards are to \"observe and report only\" and are not to provide any physical intervention, manual restraint(s) and/or assistance, or direct supervision of the youth in care, nor are they trained on the trauma informed responses or practices utilized by direct care staff. While reviewing the facility's program statement, it was not clear about the specific role(s) security guards play in the facility. In addition, the plan of operation is silent on what the security guard(s) are not allowed to do. As discussed during meetings and in-person discussions held between Community Care Licensing staff and Sacramento County, the security guards are to \"observe and report only\" but this is not explicitly indicated. The Plan of Operation/Program Statement are not clear about security guard training related to the agency's emergency intervention and/or trauma informed practices. LPA Hill did issue a Technical Advisory (LIC 9102TV) regarding this and did request that this be updated and provided to the Licensing Program Analyst reviewing the Plan of Operation and Program Statement. Exit interview was conducted and documents were provided to Pedro Shamar Lewis, along with appeal rights.",

    "narrative": "On 10/08/2024 Community Care Licensing (CCL) and the County of Sacramento held the monthly Sacramento Welcome Home (SWH) TSCF (Temporary Shelter Care Facility) collaborative meeting over Microsoft Teams. In attendance were Cathi Johnson, Ali Neira, Alicia Wasklewics, and Tashna Ward from the County and, from CCL, Rosa Rodriguez, Jodean Hall, Hillary Hall, Connie Goldie, and Chad Cabigon. After introductions, the following was covered: CCL acknowledged and thanked the County for the submission of its Written Plan, received by CCL on 09/25/2024, in response to the items covered during the first collaborative meeting held on 09/10/2024. The County has since assigned two new program supervisors to the SWH locations and is looking to fill a third supervisor position pending the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors\u2019 approval which is expected to pass on 11/05/2024, bringing the total number of program supervisors to five (currently, there are four). Regarding the plan to re-designate an administrator, it was noted that Alicia Wasklewics is set to go through the administrator training/certification at the end of this month (October, 2024). CCL clarified that the required facility manager designation is specific to each shift per House/location when children are present. Being that there are only four supervisors covering all the Houses, there are times when no supervisor is available at a given location. The County stated that they have implemented an assigned Worker of the Day or \u201cWOD\u201d to cover those locations and/or times when a program supervisor is not available. CCL requested that on the schedules (on the LIC 500 or Personnel Report) it is specified who the WODs and supervisors are and that those designated are spelled out as \u2018facility managers\u2019, that all other CCL-required positions are spelled out (including, for example, Administrator) under the \"Job Title,\" and that an updated form be submitted for each location by October 31, 2024. The County stated that some of the limitation(s) in properly reflecting these positions may be due to the need to have it cleared by the staff's union beforehand and that, relatedly, the same constraint(s) may be affecting the finalizing of job duty statements for care staff to acknowledge. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 2) Also discussed were the missing full or seven-day reports which are the follow-up reports to the County\u2019s 24-hour notifications. Per the County, management is paying close attention to the October reports to ensure compliance: the 24-hour reports are being done in a timely manner but the intermediate step involving a supervisor de-brief is where the reports are getting held up. The County are actively working on a pilot program set to start at the end of November or the beginning of December, 2024, which is meant to help track reports through a more automated system. It is CCL\u2019s expectation that the outstanding full or seven-day reports for previously-submitted 24-hour notifications (for September, 2024) will also be submitted to CCL by October 31, 2024\u2014the number of missing full or seven-day reports are as follows: Pasadena House \u2013 11; Madison - 27, and Chicago \u2013 10 (for a total of 48). It is also CCL\u2019s expectation that an immediate correction plan be put in place to be in compliance with Title 22 Regulations. Regarding training requirements\u2014specifically, Section 84065(i)(1)(D) which discusses the need for an assessment of the efficacy of training\u2014CCL noted, based on interviews, that direct-care staff may not have a sufficient understanding of the training topics covered despite having received the training. CCL advised that post-testing or return demonstrations to assess for competency may be developed by the County, themselves, so long as those assessments are documented in each staffer\u2019s file. The County stated that management will check-in with the supervisors about this protocol and also added that the supervisors do meet with their staff every month, are probably doing at least some type of performance evaluations, and that they may just need to do better at documenting. CCL is requesting an implementation plan to be compliant with Title 22 Regulations, and that this plan should be submitted by October 31, 2024. Additional training support: CCL advised that the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office only provides training on the Foster Youth Bill of Rights but not on anything more specific like medications, for example. CCL provided the Ombudsperson's Office portal and link to sign up for Bill of Rights training. The County asked if CCL, apart from the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office, provides more topic-specific training\u2014CCL advised that it does and that this training will be scheduled for the County by the end of November or the beginning of December, 2024. On the SWH Program Statement being made accessible to staff: the County stated that they are still working on the employee handbook\u2014along with this process the care staff have been given electronic access to the Title 22/Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Regulations digitally and parts of the Program Statement on which staff get trained. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 3) Regarding the POC for the Personal Rights citation on the Chicago House on inventory check/searches. The POC was submitted to CCL on 10/03/2024, this procedure is still under review by CCL. Regarding the POC for the Personal Rights citation on the Madison House, the County will check on the progress of training for staff which is expected to be completed by 10/11/2024. Regarding the POC for the overcapacity citation on the Pasadena House, this POC was submitted to CCL on 10/02/2024 and is still under review. A copy of this report is being emailed to the County for signature.",

    "narrative": "On 01/14/2025 the CA Department of Social Services\u2019 (CDSS) Community Care Licensing Division (CCL) and the County of Sacramento held the monthly collaborative meeting over Microsoft Teams. The attendees were: from County, Cathi Johnson, Alondra Neira, Tashna Ward, Alicia Wasklewicz, and Veronica Carrillo, from CCL, Margo Castaneda, Jodean Hall, Rosa Rodriguez, Hillary Hall, Connie Goldie, Tina Thorn, Chad Cabigon, and from CDSS\u2019 System of Care Branch (SOC), Kelley Hartman, Levi Huser, and Alicia Bernstein. Topics discussed at the meeting were: What\u2019s working well: The County expressed having two TSCF\u2019s is much more manageable. They have also had a lower census on average as of late between the Welcome Home locations which has been helped by the recent capacity expansion through outside partners. Temporary move from Chicago House to Pasadena House: Due to an infestation of carpet beetles the facility is being fumigated. Designated Administrator: CCL noted that Alicia Wasklewicz passed the Administrator Exam; County was informed that Regional Manager (RM) Castaneda requested the expedited processing of Ms. Wasklewicz\u2019s administrator certification. CCL reiterated expectations for a facility administrator: to be on facility premises for the number of hours necessary to manage and administer the facility in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to be readily available for the responsibilities and oversight of the facilities. CCL also reiterated the need for staff to be designated to act on the administrator\u2019s behalf with the overall management of facilities in the administrator\u2019s absence. CCL emphasized that these designees also need to be able to provide Plans of Correction for citations issued during inspections\u2014County confirmed that these facility manager designees have been given this authority. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 2) Plan for Pasadena House license: The County will continue to keep the license until further notice. Training Requirements: Follow-Up: County will be sending the template for staff training. Security Guards \u2013 Fingerprint Clearance Needed: CCL advised that all security guards positioned in the home need to be fingerprinted and obtain criminal record clearances through Guardian due to the frequency, consistency, and recurring nature of their presence. The due date for the completion of fingerprinting is 01/31/2025. Reporting Requirement Update \u2013 Incident Reporting CCL discussed the continued issue of late and/or missing reports and acknowledged it is vastly improving. County stated that they are continuing to address this and with Ms. Wasklewicz as administrator, her presence in the Houses more frequently should help address the reporting. The County also expects to start testing the SMILE system this week with the goal of launching in the end of February. Inventory Check/Searches: CCL followed up on the submission of the County\u2019s Prudent Parenting activation form related to searches for CCL to review. The County will be submitting the form. CCL/SOC pointed out that Prudent Parenting is usually in reference to decisions that a substitute caregiver makes to afford youth something that resembles a more \u201cnormal\u201d way of life such as allowing youth to participate in certain activities without prior approval from their authorized representative. SOC discussed that the Prudent Parent Standard is a general framework through which providers can respond as necessary to help support youth, but it might not always be appropriate, and its use should depend on the population and/or individual youth in question. Facility Overview: Both LPAs stated seeing an increase in engagement between youth and staff participating in various house activities. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\n(PAGE 3) Additional feedback: SOC reminded County of standing offer to provide consultation and guidance and encouraged County to reach out, as necessary. Training materials have been sent to County from SOC that may be helpful and could be integrated in the Shelter\u2019s program. County to submit Program Statement updates by 01/31/2025, to include clarification on the mandated initial vs. annual training, as well as policies and expectations related to contracted security personnel who work onsite at the SWH locations. Closing discussion on restraints: The County stated that all staff will start Phase 2 of the TCI training in February, 2025, and that they anticipate completion in March, 2025. CCL advised that a manual restraint should only be executed by a trained staff and should only be resorted to in a health and safety consideration for a child or staff, that it is more about good training that truly helps staff be proactive with early interventions, how to identify early on what the specific youth\u2019 triggers are, and how staff can equip themselves with enough techniques to de-escalate a situation. Additionally, it should also be helpful for the County to be familiar with the temperament and tendencies of their direct-care personnel so as to better inform management on staffing decisions and training considerations.

Both the county and CCL reported on what\u2019s going well: Alicia Wasklewicz collaborated with Systems of Care representative and obtained resources and expressed gratitude for the connection. LPAs for each facility reiterated that the staff have been engaged with clients and responsive to LPAs. LPA Goldie reported on progress with Program Statement Review. LPA stated that she was able to access forms easily. LPA also stated that most of the revisions were a matter of gaining clarification, requesting transcripts, and having County provide more explanation regarding how the processes will be implemented. LPA Goldie gave a briefing on revision requests, namely the under 6 and discipline policies and of requesting transcripts for staff to ensure requirements are met. The County expressed that obtaining transcripts is proving to be a longer process depending on the time frame in which the staff took the required courses. The incident report submission process was discussed, with the county\u2019s new system, SMILE being implemented 03.17.25. C. Johnson explained that the county\u2019s new system should reduce the reporting time frame by providing email alerts to submit required reports and will provide more reminders to support staff. Continued 809C\n\nThe county was informed that, going forward, they will be cited if incident reports are turned in late. CCL shared information about our Technical Support Program that will provide support and training for the facility. T. Ward reported 12 staff are fully trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI). There are still staff needing to be trained. It was reported that enough staff are trained to ensure there are 2 people per shift available to do restraints if necessary. The expectation is that all staff are trained by April 1, 2025. County reported that on March 22, 2025, Foster Hope is set to take over operations at the current Madison House. Youth will move to Pasadena and Chicago House to allow Foster Hope to get situated. The County expressed a desire to keep Pasadena House as a home to relocate youth if Chicago House needs to be evacuated for emergency reason or if something needs to be fixed at Chicago House. It was also expressed that Chicago House may be used to conduct staff training and/or for youth visitation when needed and if not occupied by youth. SOC asked if County wanted their harm reduction policies/forms reviewed. A. Bernstein provided email address to the County. Regional Manager M. Castaneda concluded the meeting after offering time for more questions or comments.",

LPA Cabigon met with Sandra Gomez, Social Work Supervisor, to whom the following report was delivered: For the inspection on 04/01/2025, interviewed facility staff reported to LPA Thorn that there were eight clients placed in the facility at the time of that inspection. A client roster was also obtained at the time which corroborated the facility having gone over its capacity. Staff stated that they were not aware of any clients who would be exiting the facility at that time. The facility failed to ensure their licensed capacity was not exceeded; the Shelter is being cited on the attached LIC 809-D per Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations Chapter 1, General Licensing Requirements, Section 80010(a). For today's inspection (04/07/2025), upon arrival, LPA Cabigon observed three clients on the premises, all of whom were, according to staff, being taken out by a community resource partner--no clients were interviewed during this inspection. Per staff, the facility's current census was four with one client who was listed as having absconded. LPA Cabigon was given a tour of the interior and exterior areas of the facility's physical plant. In clients' bedrooms, there was not enough personal storage space observed; the Shelter is being cited on the attached LIC 809-D per Group Home Regulations, Section 84088(c)(4)(A).

    "narrative": "On 05/13/2025 the Sacramento Regional Office of Community Care Licensing\u2019s (CCL) Children\u2019s Residential Program and the Sacramento County Department of Child, Family, and Adult Services (DCFAS) held the monthly Temporary Shelter Care Facility (TSCF) collaborative meeting over the Teams platform. In attendance were Margo Castaneda, Jodean Hall, Rosa Rodriguez, Connie Goldie, Chad Cabigon, Sarina Buchannan, Zaria Turner, Cathi Johnson, Ali Neira, Alicia Wasklewicz, Tashna Ward, and Veronica Carrillo. The following items with respect to the Sacramento Welcome Home (SWH) locations were discussed: What\u2019s Working Well: Both the County and CCL stated there is much more collaboration going on which has been very beneficial. SMILE has made a huge impact on getting IRs timelier. Alicia Wasklewicz has made a tremendous impact being at the homes. Provisional License: CCL informed the County that the provisional status of the Pasadena and Chicago Houses will be extended to 11/30/2025\u2014the updated licenses will be provided to the County shortly. Under 6 Program Statement: CCL informed the county that the review of the Under 6 program statement is in progress and requested access to few more documents the LPA was not able to open. Request granted during the meeting. Incident Reports: The SMILE system has been a big success. County is still working on a few inconsistencies and duplication of reports. The county will reinforce to the staff the policy of IRs. (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE, 809-C)\n\nHarm Reduction: As previously stated, any harm reduction plan must be approved by CCL before its implementation. It was also discussed that the harm reduction plan must be specific per youth, and CCL recommended that County reach out to the SOC (System of Care) Branch and to the case carrying LPA and their Licensing Program Manager for collaboration. Unauthorized Absence: County clarified that after four hours of a youth being gone, they pack up their belongings for safe-keeping. County explained that the runaway youth does not necessarily lose their bed if another youth comes into the facility unless that youth tells the facility beforehand that they do not plan to return within 24 hours. County also shared that they continue working on having direct-care staff be more consistent about following youth to the end of the Homes\u2019 property lines when clients elope. Reporting Requirement 10-day overstay: By way of reminder, CCL requests County include both the assigned LPA and the LPM (Licensing Program Manager) when sending out the overstay reports. Over-Capacity: County shared part of the challenge has been that their TSCF-partner providers may refuse to accept youth for staffing reasons or due to the level of care and/or compatibility concerns for certain cases. County explained they are working with other providers for additional locations. Another obstacle is when placement is found for the youths but they refuse. Restraint Training: County explained that there is a small group that needed to re-take a required test before transitioning to the next phase causing a delay. By the end of today, the Administrator will be sending a list of fully trained staff and/or a scheduling plan that shows at least two staff per shift are certified to utilize manual restraints if needed. County reiterated its aversion to staff applying restraints on youth and has come up with a Best Practice Acknowledgement form that they are requiring staff to sign before staff are cleared to use such interventions\u2014these forms are being sent out starting this week. CCL asked if County can identify any additional support that CCL can provide; no other items were discussed at this time. A copy of this report is being provided to the County.",

No youth reported any instances of not being taken to acute care when medically necessary though there has been at least one instance where Shelter staff should have sought for services sooner on behalf of a minor. Regarding a possible mishandling of medication administration, though LPA was not able to independently verify that a youth was taken to emergent or acute care, there was sufficient corroboration between the interviewees that this was done, and that this was done to have the youth evaluated following staff deciding to hold a psychotropic medication. The medication being whithheld was due to concerns about adverse drug interactions as the youth was suspected of being under the influence of an illicit substance at the time. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur; therefore, the allegations are Unsubstantiated.

LPA met with County of Sacramento Division Manager Cathi Johnson. LPA was given a tour of the interior and exterior areas of the facility's physical plant. The facility has three client bedrooms with each room having two beds; the bedrooms contained the required bedding and furniture which were observed to be in good repair; most of the rooms had sufficient storage/drawer space for clients' personal belongings. There is one common or shared full bathroom in the hallway that leads to the bedrooms. There was a carbon monoxide detector observed in the hallway. All the bathrooms were generally in good repair, with toilets that flushed and fixtures that provided hot water. The temperature in spaces/rooms that clients occupy was within the required range. There are multiple refrigerators and/or freezer units all observed to be in good working condition and provided temperatures within the required range for perishable items. There is also sufficient storage space for dried goods or non-perishable items. The facility currently has a sufficient amount of perishable and non-perishable food items for at least three days and one week, respectively. Also observed within a secured staff office were lockable cabinets for confidential files and medications. Most of the potentially hazardous cleaning agents and chemicals were stored appropriately in a secured cabinet. The backyard was found to not have any potentially hazardous areas or items; the pathways are unobstructed. The following items will need to be addressed for the issuance of the provisional license: all cleaning agents/chemicals are to be secured; a weekly food menu is to be posted; the hallway bathroom's shower fixture (valve) is to be repaired; a separate log is to be kept for each psychotropic medication; a part of the east fence-line in the backyard is to be repaired (loose planks, exposed nails); personal storage space in the bedrooms shall be provided (a minimum of two drawers or eight cubic feet of drawer space is required for each child); curtain rods in the bedrooms are to be repaired/secured.

    "narrative": "Statements from interviews and video recordings reviewed by LPA Thorn and LPM Hall provided consistent information regarding the allegations that staff did not intervene when a minor was hitting another minor with an object, staff spoke inappropriately towards a minors, and staff yelled at a minor in care. An incident occurred in early July where two minors in care engaged in a verbal and physical altercation which continued over the course of two days. During one afternoon, the minors began throwing kitchen items at one another and at the wall. One staff recorded a portion of the altercation on their phone. Staff interviewed stated they were removing items that could be used as a weapon, however, on the video, there were items within reach of the minors that were later used as weapons. Staff who were interviewed reported trying to verbally deescalate the conflict, but the words used by staff in the video were not effective in calming or redirecting the minors. One staff was heard raising their voice at the minors in the video, but was not seen in proximity of the minors, physically intervening or redirecting the minors. In one of the videos reviewed, a staff member can be seen and heard screaming and arguing in face-to-face proximity with the minor. A staff member admitted that they did become inappropriate with the youth during and after the recorded statement that was made in the second video. A Program Supervisor stated that they had to intervene when the staff was arguing with the minors. Five staff Interviews, one client interview, and 1 security staff interview were consistent that there are staff members that engage in inappropriate and antagonistic interactions with the youth. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. Citation is being issued for violating Title 22 Division 6, Chapter 5, Section 84072(d)(1) Personal Rights A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and LIC-9099D were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.\n\nAn incident occurred in early July where two minors in care engaged in an altercation. Records and interviews indicate the minors were supervised by staff and ratio was maintained. The conflict between the minors was ongoing over a two-day span with multiple staff observing the behaviors of the minors. At some point during the altercation, it became physical between one minor and one staff. The minor says they were pushed by the staff, but the staff on shift indicate the staff had been spit on by the minor and the staff folded their arms fold across their chest and was trying to create space from the minor. In a separate incident, a video shows a staff member lunging forward in the direction of the minor during a heated argument, however, it is unclear whether there was any physical contact. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and appeal rights were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.",

Videos obtained show staff yelling at minors and minors engaged in physical altercations while staff did not intervene, which created an unsafe environment for the minors in care. Staff training logs show that ten of eleven staff were missing mandatory reporting training and that only three of eleven staff completed de-escalation training. There was no evidence that the eleven staff working at this facility completed Trauma Informed Training or the required number of training hours outlined in the facility\u2019s Program Statement. Three staff corroborated that more training is necessary for them to feel as though they are prepared to meet the needs of the minors in care and reduce the numerous incidents at the facility, including multiple unauthorized absences, drug use inside the facility, and physical aggression between peers, which were reported to the Department. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) are found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

All staff interviews indicated that services are requested for minors immediately during minor\u2019s intake. All staff and Program Supervisors reported that sometimes there are issues that arise around county social workers who do not authorize or approve services timely, however, the services are never denied for any reason by the facility staff. Staff stated that minors sometimes refuse services. LPA reviewed records of the only three youth who were present at time of the inspection, who had been there for over 24 hours. All youth had names of their placement county social worker and the date that facility requested services and a CFT. All minors declined to be interviewed by LPA, however, during two visits to the facility, LPA observed at least one service provider arrive to work with a youth, and during one visit a staff was seen to be counseling a minor who was having trouble handling conflict.

    "narrative": "On 7/21/2021, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) David Hiett received an email from Program Manager Sky Gray requesting a conference call regarding a personnel issue. At 12:30PM, LPA Hiett spoke via telephone with Program Manager Gray and HR Manager Tony walls. During this call, Ms. Gray described inappropriate staff behavior involving C1 (see LIC811). Per Ms. Gray, on 7/10/2021, staff member S1 directed C1 (see LIC811) to the bathroom to clean himself after he defecated and soiled himself. Upon leaving the bathroom, C1 was naked from the waist down. Ms. Gray stated that S1 then went over to S2 and S3 and made degrading remarks about the size of C1's penis. Staff did not make any report to CCL or other appropriate agencies about the incident. Per Ms. Gray, S4 (see LIC811) came forward and spoke with supervisor S5 (see LIC811) and reported the incident to her. S5then reported the incident to Ms. Gray on 7/19/2021. Facility cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, regulation 87072(d)(10) \"Personal Rights: To be accorded dignity in his/her personal relationships with staff and other persons.\" Based on records reviewed and interviews conducted on 7/21/2021, S1 was found to have made inappropriate comments that compromised the dignity of C1. In addition, the facility was cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, regulation 80061: \"Reporting Requirements: Upon the occurrence, during the operation of the facility, of any of the events specified in (1) below, a report shall be made to the licensing agency within the agency's next working day during its normal business hours. (E) Any unusual incident or client absence which threatens the physical or emotional health or safety of any client. In addition, a written report containing the information specified in (2) below shall be submitted to the licensing agency within seven days following the occurrence of such event. \" {continued on LIC812-C}\n\nBased on record reviews conducted on 7/21/2021, LPA Hiett determined that no incident report had been submitted to CCL and that notification of the event was not made within the required 24 hour time frame. Interviews with staff indicated that none was familiar with California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, regulation 87072 (Personal Rights) and that no training on this topic had occurred. Interviews further revealed that staff were not familiar with Incident Report guidelines and were unaware that an incident of this type needed to be reported as outlined in in regulations. An exit interview conducted and a copy of the report and appeal rights were provided to the facility.",

The facility is clean, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. All passageways are unobstructed. There are no bodies of water on the property. LPA Bertoli reviewed 3 client records, all of which were compliant with relevant regulations. Staff records were reviewed separately at the HR office. The complex has both an East and a West wing. The East wing houses their STRTP, which does not have any residents at this time (anticipated date 2024), and the TSCF facility is in the West wing. The TSCF wing has four halls radiating from a central milieu area. Each hall contains four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a utility or game room. All halls are built to the same floor plan. The water temperature was tested at 115 degrees. There are outside play yards with climbing frames and play structures with wood chip surface. There were no hazards. Administration and admissions offices are housed in a separate building on the same campus. Between the wings is a central area containing a kitchen and dining area. The facility has a commercially licensed kitchen, which is staffed with a chef and residential service workers. Cleaning is done by residential services workers on a 7-day basis; disinfectants and cleaning solutions are stored separately in the back of the kitchen area and are transported by service workers by cart as needed. (cont on LIC 809-C)\n\nSince the kitchen/dining area connect to both wings/facilities, access is controlled electronically by computer and by card keys that staff have with them. Clients from each facility will have different meal times and clients will not be allowed to commingle with clients from the other facility. The facility stores all medications centrally at the nurse's office and the Medication Room, which is in an office connected to the dining hall. Medications are distributed to residents from there. A first aid kit is in each hall and the medical office has first aid kits for use when youth are off facility. The lockers are padlocked, both staff and resident know the combination. All required postings are present. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were in all areas. LPA Bertoli reviewed the facility's intake procedures, discharge procedures, reporting requirements regarding the 10-day placement limit, daily reporting requirements and AB 388. No Title 22 deficiencies cited at this time. An Advisory Note was issued as 4 staff had been previously been associated to the facility, but all 4 were separated as of 1/1/2019.

The Incident Report was submitted to Community Care Licensing (CCL) on September 7, 2020. The incident occurred on 09/06/2020. While on Wayfinder TSCF property, Client #1 purchased drugs from an unknown man standing at the bus stop located behind the facility. The transaction occurred through the gate of the facility. After the transaction, Client #1 proceeded to pass the drugs out to four (4) other clients at the facility, at which time the drugs were consumed by all five clients. Four (4) clients were seen by the facility nurse, one (1) client refused to be seen by the nurse, and the Mental Health Clinician spoke with all five (5) clients regarding the dangers of taking drugs. During this visit LPA spoke to staff and obtained statements. LPA was also informed that Client #1 is no longer placed at the TSCF.

LPA attempted on three occasions to reach the client's social worker but was unsuccessful. LPA also reviewed the email chain between Wayfinders and the Department of Children & Family services. Wayfinder staff repeatedly requested assistance from DCFS because they were not properly trained to feed Client #1 or maintain her feeding tube. The emails also indicated that the client had insufficient feeding supplies with her when she arrived on site. LPA reviewed the daily observation log for Client #1 and noted that although she was in the facility for three days, she was only given one shower and on the first day she was not fed from 3:05 AM until 1:00 PM while staff waited on authorization from nursing. The shift notes indicate that insufficient feeding supplies hampered efforts to feed C1 properly and on the day of discharge she was not fed due to a missing g-tube connection.

On January 31, 2023, an application and licensing fees were received for Aldea Foster Family Agency, Adoption Agency and Transitional Housing Placement Plan facilities. On February 1, 2023 the Department conducted relocation inspections for Aldea Foster Family Agency and the Aldea Adoption Agency. On February 14, 2023, the Department conducted a pre licensing inspection for Aldea Transitional Housing Placement Program. During that inspection, it was discovered that the 3 Aldea facilities were conducting business although the licensing procedures were not finalized for their relocation. Ultimately, the Department did license all three facilities on February 23, 2023. The civil penalty for operating unlicensed is $200.00 per day. In the spirit of collaboration with entities that care for the State\u2019s vulnerable client population the Department will assess penalties for 2 days when in fact, all 3 Aldea community care facilities were operating unlicensed over one week. This occurred due to a set of circumstances/oversight by Department staff and the fact that the Aldea community care licensing agencies employed a new Program Administrator. The Program Administrator has complied with the Department's requests for required documentation and now knows the licensing requirements for facility relocations.\n\nThere is an additional mandate due to the Aldea facility moves. The Department is requiring the 3 Aldea community care licensed facilities to amend their Program Statements. Please ensure they reflect the new addresses for of each of the 3 new locations. Please provide the amended Program Statements by March 31, 2023. On March 8, 2023, Licensing Program Analyst Dawn Eunice delivered this LIC 809, LIC 809D, Appeal Rights, and LIC 421A civil penalty report.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced annual inspection at the agency and met with Karen Lustig, Social Worker Supervisor (SWS), and Krystal Johnson, Administrator who assisted with the inspection. LPA and SWS conducted a walk-through of the agency, which is located in a commercial building. LPA observed two conference rooms, four visitation rooms, two break rooms, one physical file room for old files, 28 offices, and three storage rooms. Staff and Client files are kept electronically, hallways and exits were clear, the agency was clean. There were four fire extinguishers which were two months past due for inspection. During this inspection the agency sent an email to the fire officials to correct this. The listed Administrator Shahrukh Chishty is no longer the Administrator, Krystal Johnson is. LPA instructed SWS and Administrator to have the agency send in to CCL the required proof of qualifications detailed in CCR Title 22 regulations section 86064(a) and LPA can change the named Administrator. LPA also learned that the agency plans to change locations around June or July of 2022. LPA advised the agency of the requirements that must be met and completed before the move takes place. LPA reviewed all 7 client files and found: one client did not have a Needs and Services Plan as required. The other six clients reviewed had Needs and Services Plans and all requirements were met for those. All clients but two were missing Health Assessment forms, TB tests, and any other medical information. Various reasons were given for this such as the client refused, the client didn't give paperwork to the agency, the appointment slots are backed up, and for one, there was no explanation. Additionally, there were no signed discharge and removal policies in any client file. The files were complete otherwise. On today's date, the facility is being cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Section 86270(a)(2)(F). Advisory notes were also issued, which are not citations. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was emailed to her with a read receipt which will serve as the record of receipt.",

    "narrative": "On 5/13/21 at 11:40AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a visit at the licensee office to address deficiencies observed during an investigation of the transitional shelter placement program (THPP). LPA met with Director Dr. Phillips and CEO Wayne Phillips and informed of the purpose of the visit. COVID-19 safety precautions were taken at visit, including masks, disinfectant, hand hygiene, and social distancing. At visit, LPA was greeted by administrative staff upon entry and informed that Director was on the phone. Director greeted LPA at 11:53AM but did not come back out to meet with LPA until 12:03PM, at which point Director informed LPA that she and CEO would be traveling to their personal residence to search for files LPA requested that they were not able to locate in the office. LPA was escorted to the downstairs conference room to wait for their return. Director and CEO returned at 12:48PM. On 2/19/21, LPA initially requested that the following documentation/information be provided to LPA for the complaint investigation: Youth Roster with the names and dates of birth for youth R1 and R2 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) and R2's twins, R1 and R2's county workers' numbers, and entry dates; Staff Roster with the numbers for the case managers, clinicians, and overnight staff; Incident Reports (IRs) for R1's unauthorized absences; IRs for R1's hospitalization at Children's Hospital in Oakland; Meeting Notes from the recent CFT with R1's social worker. Some of the information requested, including youth's names and dates of birth, staff contact information, and social worker information, was requested to be submitted because Director was unable to provide this information during the visit. At that time, Director stated all would be submitted to LPA by the following day. LPA followed-up on 2/24/21. No response nor documentation had been received by 3/16/21, and LPA followed-up again on that day by phone and email. LPA follow-up again on 3/23/21 and left messages for both Director and CEO. On 3/26/21, Dr. Phillips faxed over the signed visit report from 2/19/21 and two copies of the same incident report for an incident on 2/20/21. On 4/6/21, LPA followed-up again to request the remaining documents be submitted. [CONTINUED ON LIC 809-C Page 2]\n\nOn 4/13/21, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Zaid Hakim sent an email to Director restating the need to submit the remaining documentation. On 4/27/21, the documentation had still not been received. LPA spoke to the Director and the licensee's administrative staff to request the remaining documents be submitted to LPA, and Director confirmed that everything would be sent over. On 4/30/21, Director requested that LPA resend LPA's previous emails requesting the documentation for Director to refer to and so Director could have a list of the requested items. LPA reminded Director that the requested items were listed on the report from 2/19/21 and also resent LPA's previous emails. As of today, 5/13/21, the remaining documents have still not been received. Director and CEO returned to the office to continue with visit with LPA at 12:48PM and had retrieved the client files from their personal residence. LPA reviewed the files at 1PM and observed the following to be missing: identification information, any medical records, medical consent forms. Resident R1's (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 5/13/21) file did not contain any paperwork documenting R1's date of birth or R1's needs and services plan or TILP. R2's file contained an application, progress notes, and staff visit check sheets, but there also was no needs and services or TILP. Both R1 and R2 were minors at placement. Additionally, the files were disorganized -- there were seven copies of only one incident report in R1's (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 5/13/21) file, and the reports for the other reportable incidents that Director informed LPA on 2/19/21 had occurred were not in the file; there was an incident report for R1 in R2's file -- and the files were not kept in the office. The other incidents involving R1 that Director had informed LPA on 2/19/21 had occurred included multiple unauthorized absences and a hospitalization at Children's Hospital in Oakland. Director and CEO were unable to provide details of these incidents as no reports were generated for any of the incidents other than the one from 2/20/21, and none had been submitted to the licensing agency within 7 days of the incident, nor was initial next working day notification made. Additionally, during an investigation at the THPP, it was learned that overnight staff S1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) did not have a key to the participant unit but did not contact the licensee about the issue. Instead, S1 suggested to R1 that R1 stay the night at S1's personal residence or travel to a friend's house. S1 did not offer to drive R1 to the youth's friend's house, and S1 did not know who the friend was nor confirm it was safe for R1 to stay the night with them.\n\nOn 5/13/21, LPA interviewed R2's social worker (SW) Lanz Ba\u00f1es. R2 was recently killed in a shooting. Refer to LIC 809 Case Management, dated 5/11/21. SW informed LPA that no notice was made to him about the death until he was contacted by R2's family. The THPP did not provide notification to the authorized representative. The THPP is required to submit the written report by tomorrow (5/14/21). LPA will provide Director with the correct licensing form to use to document the incident. Lastly, during today's visit, LPA observed at 11:45AM that the facility license was not visibly posted in the office where visitors can view it. LPA was unable to locate the license. Director informed LPA that they have misplaced their copy of their license and need a new one. Based on the above, the following citations/advisories are being issued at today's visit. Refer to the attached advisory notes and LIC 809-D pages of this report. 1. Due to not furnishing most of the requested documentation and client, staff, or social worker information after multiple requests, a citation is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80044 Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency. Please also note that a similar deficiency was previously cited on 6/18/18. 2. Due to not giving notification of incidents nor submitting written incidents reports to the licensing agency of reportable incidents, including R1's multiple unauthorized absences and hospitalization, a citation is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86061 Reporting Requirements. 3. Due to incomplete client files that were missing medical records, needs and services and/or TILPs, identifying information, a citation is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86070 Participant Records. Please also note that a similar deficiency was previously cited on 08/14/19. 4. Due to not storing the client files in the office and instead at Director's personal residence, a technical violation advisory is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86070 Participant Records. 5. Due to staff S1 not ensuring R1 was safe to stay at an unidentified friend's house and not being able to accord the youth with safe home accommodations, a technical violation advisory is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86072 Personal Rights. 6. Due to not contacting the authorized representative of the death of a youth in care in a timely manner, a technical violation advisory is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86061 Reporting Requirements. 7. Due to not having the license prominently posted, a technical violation advisory is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86009 Availability of License.\n\nAn exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Director Dr. Phillips, whose signature on this report confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "CCLD has recommended testing, particularly if there has been a known exposure, and has provided guidance on preventative measures, such as wearing masks. PIN 20-19-CRP (combined with ACL No. I-62-20), issued August 13, 2020, states on Page 3, \"Foundationally, the residence of a child in care is not a public place, and should be treated as their home, with reasonable effort made to ensure that the experience the child has is as normal as possible. Children therefore are not required to wear face coverings while in their residences, whether that residence is a home-based setting or a congregate care facility.\" It would be reasonable that this expectation be the same for testing. A facility cannot deny a youth re-entry into their home unit. If the facility is informing the placement agency that they cannot meet the youth's needs due to their behaviors, the facility cannot discharge the youth immediately unless the youth is removed during emergency situations by authorized personnel. The facility must provide the placement agency notice of at least seven days or, following the local placement agency's policy, fourteen days. Based on observations and interviews, the facility required a social worker to pick up R1 from the hospital. The facility provided the reasoning that the facility would not pick up R1 because the hospital was out of county. R1 had been hospitalized on a 5150 psychiatric hold. The facility staff did not respond to the emergency and follow R1 or ensure R1 was safe and then refused to pick up R1 to bring R1 back to their home at the THPP participant unit. Staff also did not facilitate the arrangement of transportation, given the social worker no choice but to pick up R1 themselves. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. There are two citations. Due to not following discharge procedure requirements, a citation is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86068.4 Removal and/or Discharge Procedures. Due to not responding to R1's emergency and ensuring R1's safety, a citation is being issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86065 Personnel Requirements.

    "narrative": "On Friday 8/27/21 at 9:57AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit for the required annual inspection. LPA made pre-visit screening calls to the main office line and to CEO's direct line and left messages with LPA's callback number. LPA was greeted by office staff S2 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) and met with Administrative Assistant Linda Peete, who Dr. Phillips stated could represent the facility on their behalf today when LPA called Dr. Phillips upon arrival to the office. Dr. Phillips informed LPA that there are currently no residential units under the program. There are also no residents in care. Notification had not been sent to Licensing about the unit(s) no longer being used. At 10:03AM, LPA observed that there was no license posted in the office. An advisory was previously issued regarding this on 5/13/21. LPA printed a copy of the license at visit, and provided to staff to post in the office. At 10:30AM, Administrative Assistant informed LPA that only 1 client file was currently available and that the other files may be in Dr. Phillips' office or at home. Administrative Assistant was able to estimate that there were about 6 youth placed at the program within the last 3 years. Administrative Assistant informed LPA that only 3 of 6 staff files were available for review. LPA reviewed 1 of 6 client files and 3 of 6 staff files and will coordinate with Director for a follow-up inspection. LPA is requesting that Director Dr. Phillips provide LPA the most current LIC 500 and LIC 610, as well as any LIC 9020s Register of Clients, per Title 22, Section 80071(a)(1), for the past 3 years, per Title 22, Section 80070(g). LPA issued six (6) advisories per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 86009 Availability of License, 86031.5 Notification, 86061 Reporting Requirements, 80071 Register of Clients, 80019 Criminal Record Clearance, 86064 Administrator Qualifications and Duties. A follow-up inspection is required to continue the review of facility files that were not available during today's initial inspection. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left at the facility.",

    "narrative": "On Wednesday, September 8, 2021 at 11:15AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit to the facility (THPP office) for the scheduled annual continuation. LPA scheduled the visit with Director Dr. Phillips and spoke on the phone to confirm the visit the day prior. This annual continuation is to complete the file review, as not all files were available during the initial inspection on 8/27/21. LPA used the Inspection Tool to complete the annual inspection. LPA reviewed all client files and staff files provided in the office. All files reviewed were incomplete. Staff files did not all contain the necessary documentation, such as criminal record clearance, health screening, and training documentation/certifications. The THPP was unable to provide the file for the current social worker. Client files were inconsistent. See LIC 811 Confidential Names for the following: - R1's file was missing admission agreement, identification page, authorized representative contact, photo ID, medical assessment, consent forms, immunization record, needs and services / treatment plans, inventory of cash resources and personal valuables. - R2's file was missing all of the above except the admission agreement and consent forms. - R3's file was missing all of the above except some program notes (meetings, stipends). - R4's file was missing all of the above except admission agreement and some program notes (meetings). - R5's file was missing all of the above except admission agreement, treatment plan, and identification page. 5 other files were reviewed from clients placed before 2018, and all files were missing multiple items. Additionally, residents with children did not have evidence of 1st aid training in their file. LPA issued citations per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86070 Participant Records and Section 80066 Personnel Records as well as an advisory per Section 86075 Health Related Services. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Director Dr. Phillips, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "On Wednesday 10/13/21 at 10AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a POC visit at the licensee administrative office. At 10:45AM, LPA met with Administrative Assistant Linda Peete, whom Director Dr. Patsy Phillips verbally authorized, over the phone to LPA, to represent the licensee and sign the reports on Director's behalf. LPA informed both of the purpose of the visit. There are no participants currently in the program. The purpose of the visit was to review the following corrections, per the plans of corrections (POCs) developed on 09/08/2021. The POCs were given an official due date of 10/06/2021, which was also written on top of the copy provided to licensee for clarity. 1. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86070(b) Participant Records. Type B. The POC was: (1) to submit a copy of the needs and services / TILP their program uses and that will be used for future clients; (2) to submit a training plan that details for current and future staff the program's procedures for ensuring client files contain all necessary documentation, including a list of the necessary documentation. This is the second time this citation has been issued within the past 12 months, so for the repeat violation, LPA issued an immediate civil penalty of $250 with a penalty of $50 per day that will accrue until the correction is completed. 2. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80066(a) Personnel Records. Type B. The POC was: to submit a training plan that outlines in detail the list of documents needed in each personnel file, how they will be organized in the personnel file, and the procedures by which the THPP will obtain these files. This can serve as an addendum to the program plan. For failure to meet the POC due date, LPA issued a civil penalty of $100 per violation per day since the due date. SEE NEXT PAGE\n\nAdditionally, POCs were not received for prior citations issued on 05/13/2021. However, LPA did not make the POC visit within the required time frame. As of today, the corrections have still not been made, so citations were re-issued, per California Code of Regulations, Title 22. 1. 80061(b)(1)(E) Reporting Requirements. Type B. Missing incident reports for resident unauthorized absences were not submitted to Licensing. The POC remains to submit any pending or unsubmitted reports and to develop a training guide for current and future staff that lists the types of incident reports, reportable incidents, and to whom and within what timeframe to submit. This is the second time this citation has been issued within the past 12 months, so for the repeat violation, LPA issued an immediate civil penalty of $250 with a penalty of $50 per day that will accrue until the correction is completed. 2. 86009(a) Availability of License. Type B. The license was not posted in the administrative office. When licensee stated they did not have a license, a one-time copy was printed, and an advisory was issued. Today, LPA observed the license is still not posted in the office. The POC is to visibly post the license in the office. 3. 86064(a)(2)(A) Administrator Qualifications and Duties. Type B. The administrator was not available during the THPP's business hours, and no staff member with administrator's qualifications was designated to cover administrator's duties. Administrative Assistant was off-duty and was called in to the office in place of Dr. Phillips, and neither a LIC 308 nor Linda's file were on site. Linda also does not have full access within the office, so, per staff, some files may be in Dr. Phillips' office or elsewhere. The POC is to demonstrate there is always coverage by qualified and authorized staff. Dr. Phillips arrived at 12:40PM. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Dr. Phillips, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "On 8/18/22 at 2:42PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit to the transitional housing placement program office for a 2 Year Inspection. LPA met with Director Dr. Patsy Phillips and President Wayne Phillips and informed of the purpose of the visit. An initial visit was made on 8/5/22, during which Director and President confirmed multiple times that they would be arriving, but after an hour and 15 minutes, they had not shown and stated they had not left their current location, which they stated was \"right around the corner,\" to make their way toward the office. On 8/18/22, LPA provided an expected window of arrival of noon to 2PM, but at 1:42PM today when LPA arrived, neither the Director nor the President were present. They were called and confirmed they would arrive, but did not arrive until 2:35PM. The worker at the office indicated that she is not authorized to act on behalf of the licensee in any formal way and cannot sign the visit report. Upon arrival, Director informed LPA that she is technically on medical leave and the facility is not operating, which had not been reported to the Licensing agency. LPA is issuing 2 citations per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80044 Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency and 86064 Administrator Qualifications and Duties and 1 advisory per 86161 Reporting Requirements. See attached LIC 809-D and LIC 9102. Licensee was previously cited for Inspection Authority on 5/31/21 and for Administrator Qualifications (Section 86064(a)(2)(A)) on 10/13/21. Due to the repeat violation within 12 months of this section, LPA is issuing an immediate civil penalty of two-hundred and fifty dollars ($250). The CARE Inspection Tool was used to conduct this inspection. There are no residents currently in the program, and the facility does not currently have any participant units. The program also does not currently have any social work / case management staff. The following additional deficiencies were found: 1) The facility does not have an emergency and disaster plan and could not furnish it during the inspection. Staff have not been trained on the emergency and disaster plan. Fire drills have not been conducted quarterly nor in over 3 months. Documentation of fire drills could not be furnished during inspection. LPA is issuing 2 citations and 1 advisory per Health and Safety Code Section 1565. See attached LIC 809-Ds and LIC 9102. 2) The Director and President stated the plan of operation may be in the office, but it could not be furnished during the inspection as LPA nor staff were able to locate it. LPA is issuing 1 advisory per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86022 Plan of Operation. See attached LIC 9102. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Director Dr. Patsy Phillips and President Wayne Phillips, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

The Department received a special incident report on Dec. 12, 2024. Per Ms. Woodruff, the office was unaware of the incident until Dec. 12, 2024. Per the narrative, P1 had two male visitors in her apartment and the visitors got into an argument. They took the argument outside and one of the visitors fired a total of five gunshots. It is unclear if the shooter meant to hit the other visitor or was just trying to scare him. P1 initially denied that the two males were her guests. However, her roommate identified the two males caught on camera as visitors to P1. Also neighbors reported seeing those two males exiting the apartment of P1. Once the two males were identified by witnesses as being seen entering and exiting her apartment P1 finally admitted that they were her visitors. P1 was terminated from the program on the basis that the participant rules state that participants are responsible for the actions of their guest and because those actions were endangering Aspiranet's lease. There was an incident report issued by Oxnard Police Department on Dec. 6, 2024 indicating that a person was arrested in connection with the shooting. LPA was provided with copies of the police report, the discharge and termination notices, the participant rules signed by P1. The documents will be placed in the office file. LPA found no violations nor deficiencies on the part of the licensee. No citations were issued. Exit interview was conducted and the program manager was provided with a copy of this report.",
