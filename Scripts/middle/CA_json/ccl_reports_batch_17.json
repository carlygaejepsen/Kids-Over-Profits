LPA's observations included that the licensee had a large supply of diapers, and the resident in care did not have a strong odor or noticeabe signs of poor hygiene. Lastly, multiple reports observed bruising to be likely from leg supports rather than abuse. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, based on LPA\u2019s observations and interviews, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur.

During the investigation there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegation. Although it was reported to CCL that there was an incident in the home of inappropriate touching in care involving C1 and a child in the home. The Investigator received inconsistent statements that supported a violation of lack of supervision resulting in the sexually inappropriate interaction between C1 and a child in the home. Confidential interviews denied observing inappropriate sexual behaviors between C1 and a child in the home. Other confidential interviews stated that the sexual interaction occurred without the knowledge of the Licensee and when the information was revealed the Licensee requested the removal of C1. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation. C1 could not be reached for comment regarding the allegation. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegation that Licensee did not prevent inappropriate interactions between client and another child in the home, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Licensee, Destiny Phillip.",

Therefore, the allegation is determined unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that the facility refused to pick up youth from the hospital. The investigation revealed a behavioral incident involving the youth on 5/24/24 which escalated to verbal and physical aggression towards staff and the Director. The incident resulted in a law enforcement response to the facility, and the youth being assessed, then hospitalized. When the youth was cleared for discharge from the hospital on 5/25/24, the facility refused to pick up the youth. Instead, the facility submitted a 24-hour notice of emergency removal citing that the youth needed a higher level of care and the youth's needs could not be met. A review of records revealed that Shelton SFH was aware of the youth\u2019s basic and targeted needs, as outlined in a county placement agency document (Letter of Commitment) and the youth's needs and services plan. The document stipulated that in the event the youth\u2019s needs cannot be met, a 30-day written notice is required. Furthermore, the facility plan of operation indicated that a client care conference is conducted prior to discharge/eviction to ensure involvement by all interested parties to prevent transfer trauma. There was no 30-day written notice submitted to the county placement agency and no record of any attempt for a client care conference prior to discharge of the youth. Based on information obtained during the investigation, there is a preponderance of evidence found therefore, the allegation is substantiated. The facility is cited under California Code of Regulations 80022(k) Plan of Operation - the facility shall operate in accordance with the terms specified in the Plan of Operation. Refer to LIC9099-D for the deficiency citation issued. This requirement was not met as evidenced by the facility not following its plan of operation when the facility refused to pick up youth from the hospital. This poses a health, safety and personal rights risk to children in care. A Plan of Correction was discussed with the licensee, and copies of the following reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection: LIC9099, LIC9099-C, LIC9099-D and LIC811 Confidential Names dated 1/17/25.

    "narrative": "LPA contacted various county placement agency staff on 8/15/24, 8/21/24, 8/26/24, 9/6/24 and 10/9/24. LPA was unable to obtain a statement from the identified minor due to being removed from placement. However, LPA obtained and reviewed additional records from the county placement agency and law enforcement. The investigation revealed that the allegations came about after the minor had a couple of behavioral incidents between 5/22/24 and 5/24/24. Minor was alleged to be often disrespectful to staff and during the aforementioned dates, minor engaged in verbal and physical aggression towards the caregiver and one staff. During an incident on 5/24/24, minor continued with verbal and physical aggression and bit the staff, despite efforts by caregiver and staff to de-escalate the minor. Law enforcement and a mental evaluation unit responded to the facility and after a safety assessment of the minor was completed, the minor was involuntary detained and hospitalized. Records show that the minor claimed the allegations occurred. Minor described ongoing issues between minor and caregiver which caused minor\u2019s escalated behaviors such as disrespectful comments, threats of hospitalization and law enforcement involvement. Although some parties interviewed observed the bite mark sustained by the staff, there were no witnesses to the incidents of the reported dates. There were inconsistent statements obtained regarding observed interactions between caregiver and minor. Based on the information gathered during the investigation, the allegations are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence found to prove that the alleged violations occurred. The finding of the allegations was discussed with the licensee and copies of the following reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection: LIC9099, LIC9099-C and LIC811 Confidential Names, dated 1/17/25.

On February 27, 2025, LPA D. Teal conducted a walk through of the SFH and observed chemicals under the sink in the kitchen, an open laundry room with liquid detergents on a shelf, which were exposed. The door to the laundry room does not have a lock on it. In bedroom 2, LPA did not observe any dresser drawers. There is one client in the room. There was a container in the closet, on the floor of the closet. I asked the administrator/licensee if there were any drawers in the room and administrator/licensee said they are going to get some. LPA observed multicolor containers in a cabinet, in the kitchen over the refrigerator. The containers were locked, and LPA was advised that they contained the client\u2019s medicine.

    "narrative": "On April 28, 2025, the Department received a complaint alleging that staff (PS2) engaged in physical altercations with a minor in care, and staff (PS2) spoke inappropriately to a minor in care. During the interview(s) with FD and S1 (both who reported to the LPA that they were not made aware, nor had any knowledge of the alleged incident), it was discovered that PS2 is no longer employed by the SFH. LPA attempted to contact PS2 on 5/8/2025, 5/9/2025, and 5/19/2025 via phone call to discuss the allegations against him. But to no avail. Contact number for PS2 was no longer in service. On 5/02/2025, LPA attempted to meet with and interview C1, however, FD informed LPA that C1\u2019s placement at the SFH had been terminated and C1 had been transported to the Welcoming Center (WC) in San Jose, CA. On 5/16/2025, an LPA from the San Jose Regional Office arrived at the WC and attempted to meet with and interview C1. But to no avail. C1 refused to meet with and speak to the LPA. On 5/20/2025, LPA (Christopher J. Williams) attempted a phone/virtual interview with C1 (at the WC). But to no avail. Per staff (Robert-Manager) at the WC, C1 refused to speak with LPA regarding the allegations. During the investigation, it was determined that the information gathered by the LPA was limited due to PS2 not being available for interview, and C1 refusing to be interviewed, making the findings of the allegations difficult to determine if true or false. The LPA\u2019s investigation revealed that due to conflicting statements gathered from confidential interviews via documentation, phone call(s) and in person, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not enough preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation. A signed copy of this report was discussed and provided to the Facility Representative. Exit interview conducted. No deficiencies cited at this time. Appeal rights was provided to the SFH.",

Regarding staff are not feeding minor allegation, confidential interviews stated that FC1 would eat breakfast every morning before school. FC1 would have a choice of what breakfast to eat.

A confidential interview stated that C1 was upset with the licensee because licensee didn\u2019t allow C1 to go to a friend\u2019s house and decided to lay outside of the home with a blanket refusing to go inside the home. The same interview reported that law enforcement was called previously because C1 had ran away from the home due to not feeling comfortable in the home. Another confidential interview reported that C1 refused to go inside the home because C1 didn\u2019t want to live in the SFH anymore. The interview continued stating that licensee and A1 opened the window to keep an eye on C1 laying in front of the SFH since they were not allowed to forcefully bring C1 in. Furthermore, the confidential interview reported that C1 voluntarily came inside the home and went to C1\u2019s room after a few minutes. One confidential interview stated that licensee would lock the doors of the home on C1 because licensee would be upset about C1 going to the neighbor\u2019s home and talk to the neighbor about what was going on in the SFH. The interview stated that police showed up to the home and told C1 to go back inside the home, but C1 didn\u2019t want to go inside the SFH. There were no reports of why C1 didn\u2019t want to live in the SFH. A confidential interview indicated that C1\u2019s representative had no concerns about the care and supervision from licensee and added that C1\u2019s behaviors began to escalate and C1 had a hard time following directions and rules. Regarding the allegation that licensee used inappropriate forms of discipline, a confidential interview stated that C1 had a wraparound team meeting, and the agreement was to take the television away as a form of discipline. Another confidential interview reported that taking the television away was the only form of discipline used in the home. One confidential interview stated that C1 would go outside, or television privileges were taken as a form of punishment. County Social Worker stated not having any concerns on inappropriate discipline in the home and licensee used taking away the television as a form of punishment as discussed in the wraparound team meeting. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that licensee is not allowing C1 access to the home and licensee used inappropriate form of discipline may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the alleged violations. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were provided to licensee Veronica Cano.",
