The facility was toured inside and out with licensee Nancy Gallegos. The home is a two story residence with five bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. There is currently no placement's at this time. Bedrooms are arranged so that no more than two children share a room and there is one child per bed. There is adequate shelf and closet space. Locks were placed on the closets at this time due to Regional Center recommendation. There were no lights in the bedrooms due to behaviors of children in the bedroom unplugging and plugging light fixtures, but were available in closet. The screen in bedroom number one was torn and had a screw lock on it due to behaviors of children opening the window from 2nd story. Bathroom number 1 upstairs, 2nd sink to right, did not drain; bathtub had broken tile an dead roach. All hazardous items have been properly made inaccessible. Cleaners and chemicals are locked in the garage. The medications are stored in a locked cabinet in the kitchen. Sharp knives are inaccessible and stored in a locked drawer in the kitchen. The facility outside grounds was also inspected and it was observed to be clean and well maintained. There is a swimming pool located at the facility the gate is wrought iron, five foot tall with no more than four inches between the wrought iron bars. The spring on the gate needs to be replaced in order for it to self latch. The back gate has a lock on it that needs to be removed as it is an emergency exit. LPA and LPM reviewed caregivers files. All caregivers have Department of Justice and Child Abuse Index Check clearances, first aid and CPR cards are current. All training records are current. Licensing fees are due on 6/14/21 and still need to be paid.\n\nBased on the inspection this date, there are no deficiencies being cited due to no clients in placement. Also, since the licensee now has guardianship over three children and has adopted another, there is only enough space for two placements based on the capacity of 6. Licensee was made aware that CCL will need to obtain a new LIC 200 to decrease capacity to 2. Licensee stated that they will be in discussion with Regional Center to see if she will be keeping her license. If licensee decides to keep license and accept additional placements, licensee will need to contact LPA to complete a health and safety inspection based on possible violations observed today.

The facility inspection was for the purpose of a case management inspection regarding an incident that occurred on or around 09/16/21. LPA inspected the facility on this date and no health or safety concerns were observed. On 09/27/21, LPA Escobar conducted an inspection of the facility. Information obtained during confidential interviews revealed that around 09/16/21, staff 1 (S1) restrained client 1 (C1) during a physical altercation in which C1 was aggressive and pushed FD to the floor, causing several injuries to FD. Several witnesses corroborated that S1 restrained C1 in order to prevent C1 from further harming FD and causing more physical damage to the facility. Based on confidential interviews, information gathered, and review of the facility\u2019s program statement and intervention plan which state restraints are not to be used on clients, it is determined that C1 was restrained by S1. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Title 22 section 80072 Personal Rights. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were provided to FD, Kenya Finnell, for signature. Original signed reports will be placed in facility file.",

Specifically, it was reported that C1 was being argumentative and physically confrontational and continued to get aggressive with FA at the SFH. C1 proceeded to cause substantial property damage to the facility and then physically held down FA. S1 tried to get C1 off FA, and the altercation resulted in C1 possibly obtaining a broken nose, per report. Several witnesses corroborate that C1 was physically aggressive, pushing FA to the floor and physically hurting FA, resulting in S1 restraining C1. The majority of witnesses confirm FA and S1 attempted to redirect C1, however, C1 was extremely escalated and was being physically aggressive with FA, resulting in S1 attempting to restrain C1 until law enforcement arrived to the SFH. SD confirmed C1 was physically aggressive and FA was injured upon arriving to the SFH, however, SD states they did not witness C1 physically hurt FA. Most witnesses corroborate C1 did not appear to have injuries at the time SD arrived to the facility, however, one witness maintains C1 suffered an injury, specifically, a broken nose, at the time of S1 restraining C1. Based on confidential interviews, information gathered the allegation that C1 was restrained by S1 resulting in injury is UNSUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met for the allegation.

    "narrative": "On March 14, 2024, Community Care Licensing received information alleging that the licensee did not provide a safe environment for a minor in care. It was alleged that FC was bit by a German Shepperd in the home. It was specifically alleged that FC became excited when the dog entered the home while the licensee was doing laundry. It was added that the back door was cracked open, and that is how the dog entered the home. It was reported that the bite was superficial and did not break the skin; therefore, no medical attention was needed. A confidential interview reported that the back door was left cracked open during licensee\u2019s trip to the garage to put FC\u2019s sheets in the washer. The interview stated that one of the two German Sheppard\u2019s (Dozer) went inside the home and FC was excited to see the dog and went towards him and Dozer snapped at FC and Dozer bit FC on FC\u2019s hand. Another confidential interview reported that Dozer snapped at FC and bit FC. The same interview stated that First Aid was applied to FC immediately. One interview reported that FC introduced FC to Dozer and Dozer bit foster child. The same interview specified feeling safe and comfortable in the home and around the other dog, Major. County Social Worker stated receiving pictures of the bite and FC skin didn\u2019t break, it was just red with no blood. The County Social Worker stated that the safety plan for the home was implemented, and licensee will provide a supervised play time with other dogs and Dozer will not return to the SFH. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that the Licensee did not provide a safe environment for Foster child (FC) in care may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the alleged violation. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were given to Licensee Janette Cornish.",

A screening call was made prior to the visit. Safety precautions were taken, including face masks, hand sanitizer, disinfectants, and social distancing. Additionally, LPA tested negative for COVID-19 on Monday 6/21/21 and does not have any symptoms of COVID-19. LPA met with Licensee Carla Henry and informed of the purpose of the visit. The facility has a capacity of 3 and currently has 3 youth in placement. One youth was asleep, and the other two did not appear to want to speak to LPA. The Licensee and her adult son reside at the site. LPA inspected the facility site and grounds. The facility is a two-story house in a residential neighborhood. LPA observed the facility had food that meets the needs of children in care and that meets the 7-day nonperishable, 2-day perishable mandate. There is a kiddy pool in the backyard, but it is empty. LPA observed the first aid kit to be complete. Per Licensee, there are no firearms or ammunition on the premises. At 2:43PM, LPA observed bleach, raid, and chemicals in the unlocked cabinet under the kitchen sink. LPA also observed bleach stored in an unlocked bottom cabinet in the unlocked laundry room. LPA advised that these chemicals should be located somewhere inaccessible to children in care. At 2:47PM, LPA observed that the hot water in the upstairs resident bathroom measured 137.8 F, which exceeds the permitted range. LPA advised that the hot water temperature be lowered. At 2:50PM, LPA observed that one of the upstairs bedrooms was locked and Licensee did not have a key. This was an issue at a previous visit as well. LPA advised that Licensee ensure she has a key to the room at the site or on her person so that she always has access to all areas of the facility site. At 3PM, LPA observed that the facility has strings of dust and old webbing hanging from the ceiling in multiple locations that should be removed. The walls behind the kitchen counters need to be wiped down. There is a hole in the ceiling above the kitchen sink that needs to be repaired. The window screen in the upstairs large room has a large hole in it that needs to be repaired. The facility was otherwise organized and tidy. LPA advised that the entire facility be cleaned, dusted, and...\n\n... disinfected. At 2:52PM, LPA observed a pile of pipes stacked in the backyard, which Licensee stated were from a trampoline that was set up in the backyard. Licensee stated that children play in the backyard. LPA advised that these pipes, which could be picked up by children, be removed from the grounds. At 2:45PM, LPA observed that Licensee was unable to open the back door to the backyard, which is one of the facility's fire exits. LPA advised that the door lock be fixed so that access through that door is possible in case of emergencies. At 2:53PM, LPA observed that there is exercise machinery obstructing the outdoor passageway to the side gate, which is one of the facility's fire exit passageways. LPA advised that this item be moved so as not to obstruct the walkway. LPA inspected the facility files. The files were complete, except for resident R1's (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) inventory of personal belongings. Licensee stated she did not make for R1 but was able to make one during visit. At 2:35PM, LPA observed that Licensee's First Aid / CPR certificate expired on 5/21/21. There is one citation per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80087 Buildings and Grounds.

On March 14, 2024, the Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services received a complaint with the following allegation(s): Staff inappropriately touched the client. This LPA conducted the investigation of the above allegation(s) and it consisted of but was not limited to a review of records, including the client\u2019s needs and services plans, medical records, and interviews with the 1 staff member (S1) on 3/18/24, S2 and S3 on 8/29/23, 1of 2 clients C2 on 12/01/23. (C1 declined to provide a statement). (Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated June 14, 2024). The Following Allegation(s) were reported: 1. A staff inappropriately touched the client. The accusation was refuted by the staff member (S1) who clarified that a situation occurred where a client was rummaging through the kitchen cabinet and received verbal guidance from the staff member. Nevertheless, before the staff member could intervene, the client successfully grabbed a 12 oz bottle and consumed its remaining contents. S1 mentioned that they made an effort to retrieve the bottle from C1's hand, but C1 pulled it close to their chest, causing the staff member to refrain from taking any further action. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that L1 retaliated against C1 for calling police. LPA's Investigation revealed that L1 stated her forms of discipline are usually taking privileges away. L1 provided a cell phone to the client to support their ability to communicate privately with their case worker and other individuals connected with the client's support and services. L1 removed the phone when the client began to abuse the use of the cell phone. The client still had access to a phone in the event of an emergency. Based on interviews conducted and record review the allegations are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations occurred. No deficiencies were cited during this inspection. Exit interview conducted. A signed copy of this report was left with Ayan Hill, licensee. Appeal Rights provided and explained. ***This is an amended findings report delivered on September 23, 2024***\n\nto the alleged abuse. The allegation that L1 yelled at C1 while in care also produced inconsistent statements through interviews. L1 and A1 both stated to LPA that they do not yell at the youth in care, but that they will speak sternly when the situation calls for it. There were no known witnesses to the alleged incident. It was alleged that L1 was not providing a safe environment for C1 in care by leaving medicines out on the counter. There were statements made that C1 has impulsive tendencies and often swallows objects. LPA's investigation revealed that L1 and A1 were consistent during independent confidential interviews in detailing how they go about the handling and storing of medications. However, on February 8, 2024, at the time of LPA's inspection, LPA observed a locked medicine box containing client medications that was accessible to persons other than staff and it was not centrally stored as required. L1 and A1 both reported they had a lot of things going on that day and although the medication box was left on the counter, the clients were all in school. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. SFH was issued a Technical Advisory during this inspection. Refer to LIC9102-TA advisory page dated 06/06/24. Exit interview conducted. A signed copy of this report, LIC9102-TA, and LIC 811 dated 2/8/24 were provided to Carissa Williams, Direct Care Staff.

Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Tira Logan informed Ayan Hill (Licensee) of Johanna Lofton being the newly assigned Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) to monitor the facility. The purpose of the meeting was to address the spike of facility's complaints. In attendance were: Tira Logan- Licensing Program Manager Johanna Aracena- Licensing Program Analyst Ayan Hill- Licensee Roberth Hahn- Ms Hill\u2019s Attorney During the meeting, the licensee reported the spike of complaints was generated because she took in care a very challenging youth who didn\u2019t want to be with her and made a lot of false allegations. She also reported the youth doesn\u2019t stay at a place very long. The youth was a placement out of San Diego County. The youth was placed at Hill Small Family Home from January 2024 through May 3, 2024. After the ending of this timed placement, the youth was removed but a week later she asked for a second chance and asked to return to Ms. Hill\u2019s (Hill SFH) on 06/06/24. Ms. Hill took her back but within 48hrs the youth was arrested for battery. Charges were later dropped, and youth was hospitalized on a 5150 hold.\n\nMs. Hill reported, Youth told her that she was going to run the streets to get out of the system and if she had to lie, she would do it. Youth also stated she was going to destroy the home when she got discharged. On 6/10/24, Ms. Hill contacted youth\u2019s social worker and requested an emergency 24hrs removal because of the youth threats. Licensee reported the youth was dangerous to bring back to the facility. During the meeting it was agreed the licensee will review Hill SFH Program Statement to focus on staff training and care for the children. Licensee will reach out to LPA Lofton if she needs help or has any questions. Ms. Hill also addressed issues with other complaint allegations findings. She reported she has been up front with the information. Ms. Hill was advised by LPM Logan and LPA Lofton to appeal the findings.

    "narrative": "The Following Allegation(s) were reported: 1. Medications were accessible to clients in care. Information obtained from staff member S1, who was present during the incidents on February 24, 2024, and March 18, 2024, suggested that C1 was able to access medication stored in the kitchen cabinet above the microwave with relative ease. A review of records indicated that C1 was taken to the emergency room on two occasions after consuming over-the-counter medications that had been stored in the medication cabinet, which they accessed by unlocking themselves. On March 18, 2024, LPA Moroney noted that over-the-counter medications were secured by a baby lock in a cabinet, while prescribed medications were placed in a separate locked box within that cabinet. However, despite the medications being stored in a locked cabinet, C1 was still able to obtain them, indicating that the existing locking mechanism was ineffective in preventing access as intended. Given these incidents, it is imperative to implement additional measures to enhance the security of the medications. Although staff members attempted to prevent C1 from accessing the medications, they were unsuccessful. In response to these events, the facility has since upgraded to a more secure combination lock to better ensure the safety and well-being of all clients. Furthermore, information from CSW2 and CSW4 indicated that they have no concerns regarding medication management or the care and supervision provided by the Licensee. ***This is an amended findings report delivered on October 16, 2024*** Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated.

Between 09/16/24 and 01/24/25, LPA Larios conducted interviews with two facility residents, one placing agency social worker and seven facility staff. In addition, on 05/12/24, the facility provided LPA Larios copies of the LIC9020, LIC500 and staff contact information. The Department received a complaint regarding allegations of General Neglect/Lack of Supervision and Personal Rights violations on youth in placement. The investigation did not provide sufficient evidence to support the allegations. It was alleged a resident in care was hospitalized due to consuming drugs. Statements obtained from staff, the resident and law enforcement records indicate the hospitalizations resulted from the resident being a danger to self or others. It was alleged that due to lack of supervision a resident had access to vape pens and alcohol. Information gathered from interviews conducted with staff revealed the facility does not conduct searches. In addition, staff denied observing the resident consume drugs or alcohol in their presence. Instated, staff reported the resident would emerge from her bedroom and state she consumed substances. LPA Larios obtained a photograph of the resident consuming alcohol, allegedly while being transported back to the facility by a staff member, however, it was unable to be determined where or when the photograph was taken. It was alleged two staff pulled a resident out of her bedroom by her legs. The resident stated on the date of the incident she refused to surrender her vape pen to staff. During the incident staff attempted to escort her out of the room, the resident struggled, and fell on her back. Staff then grabbed her legs and pulled her out of the room. One of the two staff denied grabbing the resident by the legs and stated the resident began kicking at the staff which did not permit them to escort the resident. The other staff was unresponsive to attempted telephone contacts and resigned prior to providing a statement. The resident roommate is nonverbal and did not provide a statement. Continued on page 3\n\nPage 3 It was alleged staff did not provide a safe environment for a resident. The multitude of allegations made during the complaint were unable to be corroborated. Although one of the residents presented with behaviors, including harm to self and others and incidents of consuming substances, there was no evidence to suggest this was due to lack of supervision by staff. It was alleged a staff member yelled at a facility resident and did not treat the resident respectfully after the resident reported she was handled roughly by said staff. The contact information provided by the facility was out of service and the staff member resigned during the course of the investigation, thus a statement was not obtained. The resident was interviewed and stated staff treat her with respect and denied the allegations were valid. Based on information obtained from interview conducted and record review the allegations are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, the standard of the preponderance of evidence was not met. A copy of this report was provided to the above-mentioned facility representative. Exit interview conducted. No deficiencies were cited.",

When the administrator was made aware of this, the facility provided C1 with a lunch to take to school. C1 then began to request Prime Drinks to take to school. The Administrator later found out that C1 was exchanging these drinks and food for drugs. On 01/20/25 LPA Garibaldo obtained and reviewed copies of Special Incident Reports (SIRs) pertaining to C1 for incidents which occurred during placement and were submitted to the Community Care Licensing (CCL). The Administrator provided SIRs to LPA Garibaldo that had been submitted to CCL. LPA Garibaldo conducted a search of the CCL SIR database and was not able to locate any SIRs related to the incidents where C1 was using lunch money to purchase drugs or exchanging drinks and food for drugs. Based on the information obtained through interviews there is a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation, therefore, the allegation is substantiated.

The investigation revealed that the facility was in compliance with the Small Family Home Building and Grounds Regulations. The Caregiver indicated that the issue was discussed with Client #2 and #5's CSWs and it was agreed that as long as the clients were matched they could reside with a roommate. At least two witnesses confirmed that the clients were to reside in single occupancy bedrooms, but did not provide the LPA with copies of the Rate Letters. The Caregiver denied that they did not participate in CFT meetings. The Caregiver indicated that at the CFT meetings the Caregiver wanted to be referred to by the title Caregiver and not their personal name in order to maintain confidentiality of the facility, address and clients. The investigation revealed that participants at the CFT wanted to use the Caregiver's name in the meetings. The LPA was informed that Ref. #5 had several missed therapeutic appointments or they had been cancelled, because there was no transportation available to get Ref. #5 to the appointment. The LPA was not given a specific time frame or number for the missed or cancelled appointments. The Caregiver denied that clients missed their medical appointments and indicated that if Ref. #5 missed their appointment it was due to illness. The Caregiver indicated that there are several vehicles available at the facility to take children to their appointments. It is determined that the allegations cannot be corroborated.

    "narrative": "On March 28, 2025, the Department received a complaint alleging that staff did not prevent minors in care from engaging in inappropriate interactions. During the interview(s) with C2, FA, S1, and S2, it was discovered that C1 and C2 previously shared a room at the SFH, however, due to C2 making complaints to staff regarding C1 evading his space, constantly taking C2\u2019s personal items and hiding them from C2, and C1 keeping C2 up late at night when C1 would experience nightmares, it was decided by staff to re-assign C1 to a different room and allow C2 to have the room to himself. There was no evidence that the staff allowed clients to engage in inappropriate behavior, nor if the client(s) took part in such behavior. During the investigation, it was also determined that while the clients are in their rooms during the day or night, staff at the SFH conduct room checks at intervals approximately between 30 \u2013 45 minutes or as needed. During the initial inspection at the SFH, LPA observed an application (called \u201cGroup Me\u201d) that the clients (due to non-ambulatory status) use to stay in contact with the staff on duty if they need anything (such as, help to the bathroom, water, snack, etc.\u2026). The LPA\u2019s investigation revealed that due to conflicting statements gathered from confidential interviews via phone call and in person, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not enough preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation. A signed copy of this report was discussed and provided to the Facility Representative. Exit interview conducted. No deficiencies cited at this time.

LPA met with the Facility Administrator/Licensee Ayan Hill. At the time of the visit there are four (4) non-ambulatory and one (1) ambulatory clients placed at the facility. Two (2) of the clients in placement are non-minor dependents. A physical plant inspection was completed with the licensee. The facility license, facility sketch, emergency disaster form and personal rights form were all prominently displayed in the home. All exits and hallways were observed to be free and clear of hazards and obstructions. Smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are in working order. The water temperature was within regulatory guidelines. First aid kit was readily available and complete. Food supplies, both perishable and non-perishable, were checked and found to be sufficient. Knives and sharps are locked in a lockbox in a kitchen cabinet. Medications are double locked in a kitchen cabinet. There are also two lockboxes for medication that require refrigeration. Chemicals and cleaning products are in a lockbox in the garage. The licensee confirmed there are no weapons or ammunition in the home. Overall, the facility is clean, safe, sanitary and in good repair. There are no bodies of water on the premises. The following sleeping arrangements were noted: Bedroom #1 Occupied by C1. Availability for two clients Bedroom #2 Occupied by C2 Bedroom #3 Occupied by C3 Bedroom #4 Occupied by C4 Bedroom #5 Occupied by the licensee Bedroom #6 Occupied by C5\n\nIndividual beds were observed in the bedrooms except bedroom #1 which is equipped with two (2) twin beds.

Staff stated that child did not exhibit any discomfort or identify being in any sort of pain. Interviews conducted with one client did not express any concerns with the home or observing anyone being hit or obtaining a bruise. Two clients were non- verbal, however LPA observed children in the home and at school and children did not appear to be uncomfortable with staff or assigned teachers. Children were observed to be happy, clean and in good health. LPA was unable to ascertain answers to questions LPA posed to children due to limited verbalization as to whether children ever received an injury or bruise while residing in the home. Interviews conducted with school administration identified noticing the discoloration in the crease of child\u2019s eyelid. However, school staff were unable to identify where or how the mark was obtained. LPA reviewed supportive documents provided by facility and no incidents were documented where a client was taken to the hospital for injuries or where observations were made of child having an injury. LPA was unable to contact county social worker, but no documents identified a problem with clients placed in the home or facility staff.

A non-staff occupant (NSO) of the home would speak inappropriately to and in front of clients. Interviews with staff revealed that NSO would use the terms \u201cnigger\u201d, \u201cbitch\u201d, and \u201cwitch\u201d when referring to a client in care. 2 Water temperature. The temperature of the water was tested and took an unacceptable amount of time (8 minutes) to come to reach level of heat required. 3. Staff schedule- Staff files did not denote hours worked and schedule provided lacked clear denotation of who was working and when. 4. Staff are not trained on cultural competency- 5. Licensee not on premises despite requirement to be present. Deficiencies cited today and a copy provided to Licensee.",

Staff handled client in a rough manner- Several interviews had consistent facts that a staff (S2) handled C3 was handled in a rough manner when he was taken down. 2. Staff used inappropriate forms of punishment- LPAs conducted 15 interviews, and 9 were consistent in fact that C1 is given showers as a form of re-direct during a behavior episode. This is considered by the Department as an inappropriate form of punishment. 3. Staff did not meet the grooming needs of client\u2019s in care- According to C1\u2019s IPP from October 2021, the placement agency approved funding for a chewing necklace to help prevent C1 from chewing her hair as it was a constant problem. However, several interviews confirm that the facility staff did not know how to comb C1\u2019s hair due to the lack of proper hair products and cultural competency. Receipts were produced by licensee however the products purchased did not reflect the appropriate products that were needed to meet C1\u2019s grooming needs. 4. Staff did not receive appropriate training- Interviews and records revealed that staff did not receive formal training on client care, medication handling and de-escalation techniques. The training records produced by the licensee are not clear as to when the staff received training. Staff certificates for medication management show a much later date from the date of hire for most of the employees. Records demonstrate that staff were giving medication to residents without formal training. Additionally, records do not indicate staff received proper training in de-escalations techniques which is confirmed by the interviews conducted. 5. Staff did not follow weekly menu as posted- As part of initial training, staff are required to be trained in menu preparing. Based on interviews, the facility staff do not prepare or follow the menu posted. When changes are made to the menu, there is no record of what was substituted as required by the placement agency. There were no records of what was served at any meal. 6. Licensee interferes with resident\u2019s activities- There are no current records that show the activities provided by the Licensee as required by the regulations. Interviews state the token reward system is used to address good behavior however, token reward system is ineffective and limits and/or restricts the activities. By limiting and restricting activities licensee is interfering with the resident\u2019s activities.

The purpose of the visit is to address non-compliance regarding the facility's inability to maintain the correct staff ratio. On June 26, 2023, LPA Bruce conducted an unannounced visit to the facility for the purpose of conducting the annual required audit. Upon arriving at the facility, LPA noted that there were three clients and two staff present. Two clients require one-on-one staff supervision so if all three clients are present, three staff are required to be present. Because there was not sufficient staff present to meet the needs of the clients in care, a deficiency is being issued today. Previously on May 26, 2023, a citation for the same offense was issued. Because this is a repeat offense within a 12 month period, a civil penalty is being assessed. An exit interview was held with Dolores Huddleston, a copy of the report, deficiency, civil penalty and appeal rights were provided.",

While reviewing the file of a new placement (see confidential Names List attached) it was noted that there was a report in their file that had not been submitted to Community Care Licensing as an incident report. The report was regarding an incident that had occurred while the client was being transported from school. During transport another student had assaulted him causing only a minor injury but police were called and pictures were taken for the police report. Discussion was had with Ms. Holcomb as a reminder of when an incident rises to the level of an incident report and when CCL should be notified. IN the above case, there was an injury and police involvement and although the client in question was not the aggressor it qualifies as an unusual incident and should have been reported. Ms. Holcomb will submit an incident report within 24 hours and supplied LPA Bruce with the report from the school and pictures. No citations issued during today's visit.",
