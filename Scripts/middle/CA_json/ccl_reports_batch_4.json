The Youth was a previous client of the facility but was not in care at the time of the arrest. Interviews revealed conflicting information. One interview revealed that while the Youth was in care, the Staff member gave the youth his phone number, and began following the Youth on Instagram, stating he could take photos of her to use for her profile. Additionally, while on walks with the Youth, the Staff member would make sexual innuendos. Interviews with staff revealed conflicting information. Four staff members were interviewed in addition to the Administrator and Administrator's Supervisor. Only one staff member interviewed stated that they did witness what could be considered an inappropriate interaction, when the staff member and Youth were tying each others shoes. This staff stated they reported it to the Administrator. The Administrator stated nothing was ever reported to her about the shoe tying incident. No other staff members mentioned hearing or seeing anything inappropriate between the Staff and Youth while she was in care. This Department has investigated the complaint alleging Staff had inappropriate relationship with minor. We have found the complaint to be Unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur.

    "narrative": "knowledge. During confidential interviews conducted, it was determined that youth, when they go outside on facility grounds for space or leave the facility during unauthorized absence(s), do find objects they can hide on their persons and return to the facility to cause self harm. While the facility does a superficial search of youth when returning from unauthorized absence(s) and do provide close supervision, youth are still successful in bringing in items without staff knowledge. The allegation related to supervision also indicates that due to the house recently switching from a one gender facility to gender-neutral, that the supervision would be negligent, allowing for additional issues related to youth interactions. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that youth in care did engage in an inappropriate activity but staff denied this was due to a lack of supervision. Youth involved in the identified incident were not available to speak to licensing related to this incident. Regarding the allegation related to staff sharing other youths' information with youth in care, this is related to youth and staff having discussions about previous youth who were residents of the facility. Confidential interviews indicated that staff were good about keeping discussions about current youth away from the general population and refusing to discuss previous youth with current youth in care. It was further indicated that when youth brought up other youth for comparison, staff refuse to discuss personal information about other youth with youth in care and are trained to deflect these types of interactions. LPA Hill could not corroborate personal information was being discussed in the facility as reported. As a result of the information obtained, documentation received, and confidential interviews conducted, the allegations that staff did not ensure sharps are inaccessible, staff was not proving adequate supervision, and that staff were sharing other youths' information are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that while the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Anderson and documentation was provided, along with appeal rights.",

LPA conducted an inspection of the facility, and no deficiencies were observed. Confidential interviews were conducted with eight individuals, during the period of May 16, 2025, to June 11, 2025. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, it was determined that C1 and C2 required an increased level of supervision and monitoring to ensure their safety and prevent inappropriate sexual interactions. The investigation found that both youths had been placed on a \"no social\" plan intended to limit their contact with each other; however, due to insufficient staffing, this plan was not effectively enforced, and C1 and C2 continued to interact. Five out of eight staff interviewed reported difficulty in managing daily work duties, providing adequate care and supervision for all youth, and closely monitoring C1 and C2 due to ongoing staff shortages. On May 12, 2025, while two staff members were occupied with routine tasks, C1 and C2 locked themselves in a room and engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior. Staff were unable to access the room until C1 and C2 voluntarily unlocked the door. As a result of the investigation, it was concluded that C1 and C2 were not provided with the level of care and supervision necessary to ensure their safety and compliance with behavioral plans. Based on confidential interviews and documentation reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. The facility will be cited under Title 22 Regulation 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (a) The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs.

    "narrative": "The first allegation was regarding an inappropriate restraint. Based upon interviews it has been determined that a client was placed in a restraint by staff in order to avoid the client hurting herself or hurting the staff member. Ultimately the restraint used served its intended purpose and in the end the restraint used was appropriate. However, prior to placing the client in a proper restraint, the staff member grabbed the client from behind and briefly held her in a choke hold in order to gain physical control while placing the child in an effective and appropriate hold. The staff member denied placing the child in a choke hold or grabbing her from behind. Witnesses stated they observed the interaction differently and stated the staff member did indeed inappropriately restrain the child briefly in his efforts to gain physical control. This poses an immediate risk to the safety and well being of the children in care. The second allegation was regarding a staff member kicking an object at or towards a client in care. During the same altercation in which an inappropriate hold was placed on a client, the staff member kicked the garbage can towards the client. The garbage can did not hit the client and the staff member stated he never intended to hit the client. In frustration over the conflict, the staff member kicked the can in anger and sent it flying into another room. Despite the fact that the object did not hit the client, it should never have been kicked and the staff member should have handled his frustration in a more appropriate fashion. The clients who witnessed the incident were intimidated by the behavior and it was clearly a violation of their personal rights. Based on LPA's interviews and document review, the preponderance of evidence has been met, therefore the two allegations above are found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

There were statements from the facility that the client returned from school on three different occasions in soiled clothing. There were statements that Ref. #1 was sent to school with two sets of clothing. Contrarily, there were statements that Ref. #1 arrived at school with hardened feces in their diaper. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegation. The LPA was not provided any information regarding Ref. #1 not receiving an adequate amount of food. The LPA observed the facility menus and observed a sufficient amount of perishable and non-perishable foods at the facility. The LPA observed on Ref. #1's medical exams that Ref. #1 was being treated for weight loss. The medical exams do not indicate that Ref. #1 was diagnosed as malnourished. It is undetermined whether the weight loss was due to stress from personal home life. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegation. The LPA received inconsistent statements regarding Ref. #1 getting an adequate amount of water. There were statements from the authorized representative not recalling the water being an issue and that Ref. #1 drinks a lot of water. There were statements that Ref. #1's urine was dark and had an odor. The LPA did not observe notes on the medical exam regarding this issue. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegation. The investigation revealed that the authorized representative and Service Coordinator had no observable concerns about the facility at this time. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding these allegations. A copy of this complaint was provided to the facility representative.",

However, RP stated that clients would go out to places such as the grocery stores.

However, RP stated they did not go to the facility that day because they weren\u2019t feeling well. In an interview with AD, they stated that they have never denied visitors to the facility. AD stated that prior to COVID, although the facility was under no obligation to do so, staff would transport Client C1 to their parent\u2019s (BM) residence for a visit. AD stated that with COVID, staff are not transporting and staying with C1 for home visits with BM. AD stated BM is welcomed to visit the facility any time and staff can accommodate and designate areas to be sanitized before and after each visit. In interviews with Staff S1-S3, consistent statements were made that visitations at the facility has never been denied. S1-S3 also made consistent statements that BM will request staff to transport C1 to their residence for visits, which staff did in the past. S3 shared their opinion on how the facility can even accommodate visitations by using the garage which has been fixed so that visitors can sit in there and have the doors open for air flow. However, S3 stated they did not know the facility\u2019s visitation policy. During interviews regarding the allegation that the facility is not returning calls from authorized representative promptly, RP named a prior administrator who RP stated would not return her phone calls for days. RP stated the facility does not communicate with her. In an interview with AD, he stated that he is committed to returning phone calls and has never had issues of not returning a person\u2019s phone calls and even keeps a call log to document incoming calls. In interviews with Staff, S1 stated that they take down messages and write everything down on a call log to ensure that calls are being answered and returned. S2 stated they do not know of any staff who purposely does not return calls or voicemails left on the machine but does admit that sometimes, the voice mailbox gets full if staff forgets to delete old messages. S2 stated that sometimes clients have TV or music on loud and staff can\u2019t hear phone ring. S2 stated the prior Administrator had issues with lack of responding to emails but that the current administrator (AD) does communicate in a timely manner with telephone, text, and responds even better with emails. Staff S3 stated they always check the phone for missed calls or voicemail upon the start of their shift and makes sure to return the calls. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. No title 22 regulations were cited during today\u2019s inspection. Exit interview conducted and a copy of this report, along with appeal rights, was left with the Administrator, Anthony Johnson.",

Additionally, confidential interviews also disclosed that when client\u2019s behavior escalate, staff will talk ro clients and give them time and space to themselves. Confidential interviews did not corroborate any incidents or issues in which S2 engaged in a physical altercation with a client. Confidential interviews described S2 as \u201cnice\u201d to both staff and clients. A review of a Special Incident Report (SIR) submitted to CCL, did, however, reveal there was an incident on November 16, 2023, in which a client dislocated a staff member\u2019s arm after experiencing behavioral dysregulation and expressing suicidal ideation and intent to harm others; however, the report did not indicate it was the named client. The Special Incident report did not reveal which staff had their arm dislocated and did not indicate it was a result of a physical altercation. In reference to the allegation that staff disclosed personal information about a minor while in care, a confidential interview revealed there was previously a client in care in the facility with a similar name. Confidential interviews and a review of pertinent facility records confirmed there is not a resident at the facility and there have been no former clients placed in the facility with the reported name. Confidential interviews revealed staff have not been seen or heard disclosing information about clients in care, and a confidential interview indicated that staff will only discuss information relating to clients in the facility in a private setting.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Hillary Hall arrived at the facility unannounced for a Post-Licensing visit and to review recent incident reports sent to the department. Far Northern Regional Center worker (FNRC) Kathy Bogue was also present at the facility. When LPA arrived, four house staff were present for 2 clients, and two more staff and one more client arrived within minutes. LPA met with House Staff \"Vic\" for a few minutes before the Administrators named above arrived promptly. LPA received a tour of the home. Facility was clean, and the office with records and medications was locked and organized. Each client had a separate bedroom, with appropriate dresser and closet space, and bed linens. A daily schedule of activities was reviewed, and client charts were available for reference. Kitchen was clean. Backyard was nicely landscaped with chairs, a swing, and a garden area for clients. No deficiencies noted in the physical plant or file review. LPA reviewed recent General Event Reports (GER's) with administrators (AD). FNRC provided LPA with Individualized Program Plan (IPP) for each of the youth in the home. FNRC indicated her youth has excelled in the home, and his behaviors have diminished. He seems happy. AD described the activities available to the youth, and the alternative interventions implemented before utilizing restraints. Staff indicated they are learning to recognize client triggers to diffuse difficult behaviors before they become aggressive. LPA asked what would happen if restraints were not used. Staff and FNRC indicated one client has a history of severe self-injury and gave himself a concussion in the past. Another client is known to attack staff. The facility has lost staff who quit, following being attacked by a client. One female staff at the facility indicated she obtained a bad black eye from client who punched her. LPA asked if clients were able to understand the concept of time. (It was referenced in the GER that clients needed to be safe for 20-30 minutes before earning back privileges.) Staff said the client may not comprehend time. It was suggested a timer with a visual cue be obtained, and FNRC said she would acquire one for the facility to use. The facility uses a Token Economy System for each youth, designed alongside Advanced Crisis Services (ACS). LPA reviewed the role of licensing and exchanged contact information, concluding the interview and tour. A copy of this report was provided to the administrators.",

Confidential interviews revealed C3 physically picked up C1 without C1\u2019s consent and C1 was touched inappropriately. However, conflicting confidential interviews revealed that C1 and C2 made up the story that C3 touched C1 and C2 inappropriately. Regarding the allegation that staff did not report incidents regarding minor in care, as necessary, confidential interviews revealed that staff wrote up incidents involving C1 and reported the incidents to C1\u2019s authorized representative. However, conflicting confidential interviews revealed that C1\u2019s authorized representative did not receive reports of incidents that occurred while C1 was placed at the facility. Regarding the allegation that staff did not adequately supervise minor in care resulting in minor watching inappropriate content while in care, confidential interviews revealed that C1 turned to television channel that had vulgar language and explicit images. However, confidential interviews revealed that staff immediately turned the television to a channel that was suitable for general viewing with appropriate content. Regarding the allegation that staff did not adequately supervise minor in care resulting in minor communicating with unauthorized adult(s) while in care, confidential interviews revealed that C1 contacted their biological mother although C1 is forbidding was forbidden to have any contact with biological mother. However, confidential interviews revealed that staff was not provided an unapproved or approved contact telephone list for C1, so staff was not aware that C1 was not allowed to contact their biological mother.\n\nBased on interviews and documentation reviewed, the allegations that staff did not adequately supervise C1 and C2 resulting in C1 and C2 being inappropriately touched by C3 while in care, staff did not report incidents regarding C1 in care, as necessary; staff did not adequately supervise C1 in care resulting in C1 watching inappropriate television shows, and staff did not adequately supervise C1 in care resulting in C1 communicating with biological mother despite there being a no contact order in place forbidding C1 communicating with biological mother, may have occurred, however, the allegations are not supported or proven by the evidence gathered; therefore, the allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated. The allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

Confidential interviews indicated that S1 told the clients they were also taking medication, such as Percocet or Xanax, before driving clients but was not seen taking anything besides alcohol. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that S1 lost the company car keys during one of the incidents when S1 was intoxicated while with the clients. Confidential interviews indicated that S1 often appeared tired and \u201czoned out\u201d while working in the facility but was not seen sleeping at work. CCL also received the allegation that Staff (unnamed) does not keep the facility free from substances. It was reported that clients in care have continued access to substances. A review of the facility\u2019s program statement reveals that a primary goal of the facility is to provide a safe environment for clients, which includes keeping clients separated from drug and/or alcohol use and supported in recovery and abstinence. Confidential interviews indicated that after returning from the outings intoxicated, the clients (C1-C3) and staff (S1 and S2) brought alcohol back into the facility and hid it in the clients\u2019 rooms while the other staff were in the back office. A confidential interview indicated that S1 also purchased alcohol and brought it back to the facility for clients to consume when S1 and S2 were the only staff working. A confidential interview indicated that staff did not search clients\u2019 rooms during the time they had alcohol. Confidential interviews and records review indicated that S1 was previously admonished and demoted for allegations that former clients made involving S1 not reporting drug use in the facility. A confidential interview indicated that, during that time, S1 also witnessed a client using a marijuana vape pen and did not confiscate it or report it to S1\u2019s supervisor. Confidential interviews indicated that former clients were able to sneak contraband into the facility because staff do not search clients upon admission.

CCL also received the allegation that Staff (unnamed) do not ensure that children (unnamed) are following their needs and services plan. It was reported that staff were taking clients to the park to hang out with friends rather than taking the clients to addiction recovery meetings. A review of needs and services plans for clients involved in the above incidents revealed that clients would maintain sobriety by, in part, attending daily addiction recovery meetings for the duration of their stay in the program.

The reported incidents disclosed were said to have occurred on or about 5/25/2024. The staff worker (S1) identified in the report has denied the allegations. S1 explained that on 5/25/2024, she allowed a client to have access to her personal cellular phone that was being projected on the wall in the cottage dining room so that the client could play games or watch videos. S1 disclosed that she received a multimedia message service (MMS) on her phone that contained an adult content image of two persons engaging in having sex while the client was using her cellular phone, and that is when the client accessed the MMS and briefly displayed the image on the wall for one to two seconds. S1 denied that it was intentional but an accident. S1 denied propositioning the same client who had access to her phone. S1 has denied kissing any clients at the facility. Staff (2-5) denied witnessing S1 engage inappropriately with clients. In confidential interviews with the clients, and facility staff workers, one individual identified as other, including a review of the facility security video could not corroborate the allegations. Based on the information gathered during interviews and documentary evidence, it cannot be determined whether the allegations occurred. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the facility representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided after the inspection. An exit interview was conducted and the Appeal rights were given and explained. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

LPA confirmed with the administrator that the POCs had not been completed. LPA was unable to verify completion of the POCs during today's visit due in part to files not being available for review. LPA reviewed available files and discussed the corrections that are still needed with Facility Manager. LPA is assessing a civil penalty for late POC, pursuant to California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80054, of $100 per day beginning the POC due date for each POC not completed. The civil penalty comes to $1,200 each for 5 late POCs, totalling $6,000. LPA advises that this is an accruing penalty and the POCs should be submitted by the end of today (12/12/23) to avoid additional penalty. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights were provided, an additional copy of the 10/31/23 report was provided, and a copy of this report was provided to Facility Manager Jackie Leonard, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.

LPA met with Facility Manager Jackie Ruan and informed of the purpose of the visit. LPA inspected five resident records and five personnel records. See LIC 811 Confidential Names. Using the CARE Inspection Tool, LPA observed that five resident records were missing LIC 613B personal rights forms, four resident files were missing property and valuables records, one resident file was missing a medical consent form, and one resident file was missing a physician's report (medical assessment and TB test result). Additionally, three residents' ages exceed the facility's licensed age range, and LPA advises that age exception requests be submitted for each resident, as identified on the LIC 811. LPA also observed that the complete personnel files for S1, S2, and S3 were not available for review during the initial visit and this continuation visit, so LPA was unable to verify the LIC 501, LIC 503, LIC 9052, 1st aid certification, intervention training certification, and initial and annual training completion. LPA is issuing 5 citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80066 Personnel Records, 80070 Client Records, 84070 Children's Records, 80069 Client Medical Assessments, and 84072 Personal Rights.

Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with staff, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. Due to the challenges of providing training during the pandemic, LPA is issuing a technical advisory per Title 22 Section 84066 Personnel Records, referencing Section 84065 Personnel Requirements.

Based on report, the allegation pertain to nonverbal resident R1's (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) medication and to an incident in which R1 was kneed in the groin by staff. It was determined that the medication was managed and administration documented correctly and that the incident was not one of abuse. However, it is not clear if the incident may have been the result of a lack of training. Based on LPA's review of staff training, staff have not received their full amount of annual training, and some have received only 4 hours of training in 2020. It is reported that this is due to the pandemic. Training titles do not include behavioral intervention (manual restraints) or medication management. Staff do have current CPR",

LPA advised that Licensee begin using the LIC 622B, or variation of, to log psychotropic medications. -- The staff files are complete and contain all required documentation. All staff are cleared and associated to the facility. Staff have current first aid training certificates. -- LPA observed that the training documentation does not reflect that the 20 hour annual training requirement, per CCR, Title 22, Section 84065, was met for 2020. Licensee stated that it has been a challenge to obtain training from outside agencies but training in the form of team meetings with Licensee and with behaviorist have been conducted in-house. LPA advised that Licensee develop an in-house training template to document in-house trainings. -- LPA observed that staff S1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 9/3/21) was cleared and associated to the sister facility also under Licensee but not to this facility. S1 works at the other facility and has only been working at this facility temporarily.

LPA requested the phone from the youth and spoke to the emergency personnel on behalf of the facility. Afterward, LPA spoke to staff, and staff stated that the youth has called 911 multiple times before and is to be monitored while on the youth's personal phone to ensure youth does not unintentionally call 911.

    "narrative": "At 1:05PM, Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Madi Fremont and AmyLe Tran met with the home above over Microsoft Teams for the purpose of conducting a COVID-19 Technical Assistance Case Management Inspection. LPAs met with Licensee and Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance were Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong, Morning Star Behaviorist Consultant Leatrice Tomlinson, Assistant Administrator Irma Battung, Assistant Administrator Gilbert Battung, and California Department of Public Health (San Bernardino) Health Facilities Evaluator Nurse Emma Erickson. Currently in care are 5 clients. (See LIC811 - Confidential Names dated 11/04/2020) The specific purpose of this inspection was for the home to receive guidance on visitation policies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage in the facility. LPAs asked Nurse Emma Erickson to provide the facility with guidance on creating a safety plan for visitation in the facility to ensure the safety of all clients and staff. LPA Fremont informed Ms. Erickson that the father of C1 and C2 (hereafter referred to as P1) is willing to get a COVID-19 test and quarantine until results come, there is no court order restricting P1 from visiting C1 and C2, and C1 and C2 share their own bedroom. Based on this information, LPA asked Ms. Erickson to guide the facility in creating a plan for P1 to safely visit C1 and C2 either in the backyard, front yard, or in their shared bedroom while also ensuring social distancing the safety of all staff and clients.Ms. Erickson advised that the best course of action for visitation is to continue to have visits through the front screen door or backyard window so social distancing can be maintained. Ms. Erickson also advised that if there is physical contact made, the clients will need to quarantine in the home for 14 days and have a staff member assigned to quarantine with them to provide care, or have the parent take their child home for the duration of COVID-19. LPA Fremont advised the Licensee to utilize pre-screening calls with the families to ensure that no symptoms are present, and no contact has been made with a COVID-19 positive person before a visit. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nPre-screening questions can include: 1. Have you experienced any symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 14 days? 2. Have you come in contact with anyone experiencing symptoms or anyone who has tested positive in the last 14 days? 3. Have you been placed under quarantine order by a medical professional in the last 30 days? 4. Are you currently being evaluated by a medical professional for symptoms of COVID-19? LPA Fremont requested the following points to be addressed in the visitation plan for C1 and C2: 1. Schedule for visitation for each family, including procedure for keeping the rest of the clients and staff separate from the visitation space. 2. Procedure for family entry to the front yard or back yard 3. Procedure for visiting through the front screen door or the backyard window, including physical barriers that will be put in place to ensure the safety of all clients and staff 4. Behavioral/emotional effects/barriers/obstacles that each child could face as a result of modified visitation procedures 5. De-escalation techniques for each child 6. Use of PPE for both parents and clients 7. Pre-screening calls with families prior to visits that confirm the absence of symptoms, including a contact screening. 8. Procedures for if physical contact is accidentally made, including but not limited to parent bringing their child home for quarantine. 9. A statement that all procedures are subject to change based on changing directive from Contra Costa County Public Health Department. 10. The Licensee may request a negative COVID-19 test before visitation, to be documented on printed test results from a primary care provider for all family members. A plan for refusal of testing must be put in place. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nRegarding PPE, LPAs requested that Ms. Erickson provide the Licensee with guidance on staff mask usage while in the home. Because not all staff of the facility live in the home 24/7, and some staff come in and out of the home to go to the grocery store, appointments, etc., LPA Fremont strongly encouraged the Licensee to require mask usage at all times for all staff in the facility - not just for the safety of the clients but the safety of other staff. Ms. Erickson agreed that masks should be mandated at all times for all staff while in the home At this time, no deficiencies are being cited. The Licensee will have until 5PM on 11/12/2020 to submit a plan for P1 to visit C1 and C2 at the home, and will also submit any new visitation plans for C3, C4, and C5 no later than 5PM on Monday, 11/30/2020. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung with read receipt due to COVID-19 precautions.",

LPA Fremont invited the licensee to voice any concerns they may have about the plan to Ms. Henson, or ask any questions they may have regarding visitation. In consultation with Ms. Henson, the home has been advised to add to their visitation guidelines extra safety measures, including but not limited to limited physical touch (hug hello and hug goodbye), and using distractive techniques to keep C1 and C2 from pulling on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Parents will also be required to adhere to a time limit on visitation, to obtain a negative COVID-19 test within a specified timeframe (to be determined), and to wear full PPE (provided by the home) that is donned at the home, and doffed out of the home. This plan will be submitted no later than 5PM on Monday, 11/16/2020. LPA Fremont will present this visitation plan to Contra Costa County Department of Public Health to get approval before implementing the plan and presenting it to the parents.

The purpose of this Case Management Inspection was to address additional incidents that were discovered during Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives' record reviews and interviews. LPA met with Licensee/Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance were Morning Star Behavioral Consultant Leatrice Tomlinson, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong, and LPA AmyLe Tran, East Bay Regional Center (RCEB) Case Manager Teena Decay, RCEB Case Manager Supervisor Ian Mendoza, and RCEB Quality Assurance Specialist Derrick Levingston. Currently in care are 5 clients. On 11/14/2020, LPA Fremont received a Serious Incident Report (SIR) from S1, which described an incident involving C1 on 11/20/2020. During a neighborhood walk to a nearby park with clients and staff, C1 started escalating in behavior, so staff decided it was time to head back to the home. On the way back, C1 threw herself onto the ground and started hitting her head against the concrete sidewalk. A bruise was observed on C1's forehead, as well as redness on her chin. Upon review of this SIR, it was discovered that this incident was not reported to C1's primary care provider or their authorized representative. On 12/10/2020 at 1:53PM, LPA Fremont conducted a confidential interview with S1 to follow-up on the incident. LPA Fremont asked S1 if this incident was reported to the primary care provider or C1's parent, and S1 responded it was not something they would report to either party because it was C1's typical behavior to bang her head. S1 also stated that they did not usually report incidents to the parent unless the parent was directly involved in the incident. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nIn a document titled \"Clarification of Reporting Requirements for Unusual Incidents Including Client Absences\" released by CCL and submitted to LPA Fremont by S1 on 12/30/2020 at 2:58PM, it is stated, \"With regard to severely emotionally disturbed clients in high level group homes, incidents which involve this clientele must be measured against the standards explained in this guide and not simply disregarded as their 'usual behavior.'\" Based on the information gathered, including interviews and review of facility records, the licensee did not report to a child's authorized representative an unusual incident which threatened the physical safety of a client because they saw it as the client's normal behavior. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80061(f) - Reporting Requirements. In addition, based on interview with S1 and review of the SIR submitted on 11/24/2020 regarding this incident, C1 hit their head on the concrete sidewalk hard enough to leave a bruise, but the licensee did not seek medical advice for this client's head injury from their medical provider and staff did not obtain appropriate medical information to observe signs and symptoms of a concussion. A deficiency is being cited per CCR, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80075(a) - Health Related Services. Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. On 12/10/2020, during a virtual complaint investigation with the home, LPA Fremont requested several documents to be turned in for the investigation no later than 5PM on 12/14/2020. LPA Fremont emailed S1 on 12/10/2020 at 3:15PM to remind S1 of the requested documents and the deadline for submittal. S1 responded at 3:54PM and 4:18PM to inquire why LPA Fremont was investigating the allegations of the complaint opened that day, stating that another LPA had already investigated and found the complaint to be unfounded, and asked LPA Fremont for a copy of the old complaint report. On 12/10/2020 at 6:34PM, S1 responded to LPA Fremont again, asking why LPA Fremont has requested to tour the facility's staff room during the inspection earlier that day, and inquired if it was a new policy. On 12/14/2020 at 3:57PM, LPA Fremont sent an email to S1 to remind them of the previously agreed-upon deadline to submit requested complaint documents (12/14/2020 at 5PM), and attached the regulation 80044(c)(1) - Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency to provide technical assistance to S1. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nS1 responded to LPA Fremont on 12/14/2020 at 4:22PM and 4:49PM, stating both times that the home's printer/scanner wasn't working, and the printer was jammed. S1 submitted two of the requested documents at 5:10PM, and one at 5:49PM on 12/14/2020. S1 emailed LPA Fremont again on 12/14/2020 at 8:08PM and 8:48PM. In both emails, S1 asked again why LPA Fremont was investigating this new complaint received on 12/02/2020, stating that the allegation \"Neglect/Lack of Care and Supervision\" could not be true and asked for an explanation of how the clients could have been neglected. On 12/15/2020 at 10:09AM, LPA Fremont responded, again referencing regulation section 80044(c)(1) - Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency to provide technical assistance, and asked that S1 submit the remaining documents that were due the day before. S1 submitted the final requested document on 12/15/2020 at 4:57PM. The document submitted on 12/15/2020 was not the correct document LPA had requested, and LPA Fremont sent S1 clarifications on 12/17/2020 at 10:24AM, 2:01PM, and again on 12/21/2020 at 1:55PM, asking that the correct document be submitted as soon as possible as the deadline had already passed. The document requested was the facility's procedure for writing incident reports and guidelines for which kind of incidents were reportable. S1 responded on 12/21/2020 at 2:17PM, stating, \"It's a very busy time of year right now with Christmas in a few days, I'm sure we have something written down from SIR trainings I've been to. Despite the pandemic, we are celebrating with the group home decorated, gifts for the kids, and a nice Christmas meal together, so my time is very limited around this time. I will email the info soon.\" On 12/28/2020 at 2:22PM, LPA Fremont emailed S1 to ask again for the correct documentation that was originally requested on 12/10/2020 and due on 12/14/2020. S1 turned in the correct documentation on 12/30/2020 at 2:58PM. During an unrelated complaint investigation on 01/06/2021, LPAs Fremont and Tran requested documentation to be used in their investigation, to be turned in no later that 5PM on 01/08/2021, a deadline which was agreed upon by S1. On 01/08/2021 at 4:44PM, S1 emailed LPAs Fremont and Tran stating it was her husband's birthday that day and scanning the documents was taking longer than expected. S1 submitted the requested documents on 01/08/2021 at 11:53PM and 11:57PM. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nOn 01/11/2021 at 3:07PM, LPA Tran emailed S1 requesting contact information for the group home staff. LPA Tran did not get a response from S1 until 01/27/2021 at 5:45PM, at which time S1 stated, \"Hi Amy, I saw this email a few weeks ago but couldn't find it when I was ready to send you the contact information. Do you still need it? I haven't heard from you.\" LPA Fremont emailed S1 on 01/28/2021 at 7:47AM, confirming that the documentation was still needed for ongoing complaint investigations, and asked for it to be submitted by the end of business hours the same day. S1 submitted the requested documentation on 01/28/2021 at 7:37PM. On 02/05/2021 at 2:06PM, LPA Fremont emailed S1 to request additional documentation of S2's administrator and facility manager qualifications. The deadline to submit was set for 02/09/2021 at 5PM. S1 responded at 3:53PM on 02/05/2021 to confirm the deadline. LPA Fremont sent a email to S1 on 02/09/2021 at 2:09PM to remind them of the deadline for submitting requested documents. S1 responded to LPA Fremont on 02/09/2021 at 4:34PM, stating that they were gathering the paperwork. S1 inquired why CCL was asking for owner's paperwork, also asking if this was a new policy. S1 turned in the requested documentation on 02/09/2021 at 5:35PM, after the agreed-upon deadline. Based on the information gathered, the Licensee did not make client records available for inspection by the licensing agency by repeatedly missing previously agreed-upon deadlines to submit documents. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80070(d) - Client Records. Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. Additionally, based on multiple interactions with the Licensee/Administrator, as well as investigations into complaints received for the facility, the Licensee/Administrator has repeatedly shown a lack of knowledge and ability to comply with applicable law and regulation, including but not limited to: Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency, Reporting Requirements, Administrator Duties, Personal Rights, Client Records, Health Related Services, and Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. A deficiency is being cited per CCR, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80064(a)(3) Administrator Qualifications and Duties. . Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nOn 01/05/2021, LPA Fremont received an email that detailed how on 01/10/2019, during Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy that was held in the garage with C2, C2 bolted into the house to take some of C1's snack, causing the garage door to swing open and hit a filing cabinet inside the house. In this email it is detailed that in response to this incident, S2 locked C2 and her therapist in the garage from inside the house, stating they were a liability to the other clients and staff. During an interview with this witness on 01/07/2021 at 10:34AM, LPA Fremont asked them to describe this incident in more detail. This witness stated that the home had offered the garage for C2's ABA therapy, and that it quickly became unsafe for C2 to have therapy in this room. This witness confirmed that on 01/10/2019, C2 had eloped from the garage into the kitchen, and S2 had locked them in the garage after stating they were a safety concern to the other clients. This witness also stated that the garage was cold, unsafe, and cluttered, relating that there were tools such as a ladder, staple gun, and hammer out and accessible to clients, and small items on the floor that could have been swallowed. This witness also related that ABA services were discontinued at the home shortly after the locked door incident, due to safety concerns. Based on the information gathered, a client was locked in the garage of the facility to prevent them from entering the house during their in-house therapy service. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(14) - Personal Rights. Additionally, due to the presence and accessibility of items such as a ladder, staple gun, hammer, and small items that could have been swallowed by C2 during ABA therapy, a deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 7, Section 80087(g) \u2013 Buildings and Grounds. Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. Finally, on 10/08/2020 at 1:30PM, representatives of CCL, Regional Center of the East Bay, and Morning Star Group Home met virtually on Microsoft Teams to discuss the home\u2019s \u201cno visitors\u201d policy during the COVID-19 pandemic due to repeated complaints from a parent. (continued on LIC809-C)\n\nDuring this meeting, an agreement was reached that the home would modify its visitation policy to allow for safe visitation from parents and other authorized representatives. The home raised concerns about this decision, and requested that another meeting be planned with a Contra Costa County Department of Public Health Nurse to go over safety guidelines. On 11/04/2020 at 1:05PM, LPAs Fremont and Tran conducted a virtual technical assistance case management inspection with the home, as well as with San Bernardino County Department of Public Health Nurse Emma Erickson, to discuss the home\u2019s visitation plan. Due to the shortage of nurses at that time, CCL was not able to schedule a nurse from Contra Costa County. During this meeting, all parties discussed barriers and challenges to visitation, and a decision was made that the home would still need to modify their visitation plan to allow for safe visitation by parents and other authorized representatives. During this meeting, the Licensee requested another meeting with a nurse from Contra Costa County as they did not want to rely on advice from a nurse who resided in a different county where COVID-19 guidelines may be different. LPAs Fremont and Tran assured the Licensee they would do their best to schedule a nurse from the home\u2019s resident county. On 11/12/2020 at 1:30PM, LPAs Fremont and Tran met again with the home, and with California Department of Public Health Infectious Disease Consultant and Fresno County Department of Public Nurse Barbie Henson, to provide further technical assistance on creating a safe visitation plan. Again, LPAs were not able to schedule a nurse from Contra Costa County due to the limited availability of public health nurses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After LPAs and the Licensee provided Nurse Henson with an in-depth description of the client\u2019s behaviors and possible challenges to safe visitation, Nurse Henson recommended that the home make revisions to their visitation plan to allow safe visitation with limited physical touch between clients and parents at the group home. At this time, the home\u2019s behavioral consultant voiced concerns that there should not be any physical touch, but conceded that a hug at the beginning and end of the visit would be fine given the visitors would be in full PPE. At the end of this visit, the Licensee requested that LPA Fremont contact the Contra Costa County Department of Public Health directly to run Nurse Henson\u2019s plan revisions by a public health doctor from the home\u2019s resident county, and LPA obliged. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nOn 11/17/2020 at 9:46AM, LPA Fremont contacted Contra Costa County Department of Public Health directly, and received an email address to contact with inquiries. LPA Fremont described the situation in detail, including the client\u2019s developmental disabilities and behaviors, and the parameters of the proposed plan for visitation. On 11/17/2020 at 3:50PM, LPA Fremont received a response from Sara Levin, MD, Deputy Health Officer of Contra Costa Health Services. Dr. Levin agreed that given the extensive safety precautions outlined in the proposed plan, limited physical touch would not be an issue, and if physical touch did occur, it would not be necessary to send clients home to quarantine for 14 days because of the extensive safety precautions in place. LPA Fremont presented this information to the licensee, and the final draft of the home\u2019s visitation plan was submitted over email on 11/19/2020 at 5:08PM. Upon review of this plan, it was noted by CCL that the Licensee used varying information from each public health representative to create this plan, and relied on advice that was the most restrictive and would allow the home to continue not to allow visitation. The home ultimately rejected advice from Infectious Disease Nurse Barbie Henson for the reason that she does not reside in Contra Costa County, yet the plan also references more restrictive advice from Nurse Emma Erickson, who also does not reside in Contra Costa County. Although the previously agreed-upon safety guidelines were approved by Dr. Sara Levin of Contra Costa County, the home continued to reject this advice for safe visitation. After this plan was submitted, visitation discussions were temporarily put on hold. On 01/06/2021, during a virtual Complaint Investigation Inspection with the home regarding a complaint received on 01/04/2021, LPAs Fremont and Tran requested that a copy of the home\u2019s visitor sign-in sheet with temperature check be submitted for the investigation. This document was never submitted by the Licensee, and S1 stated this was because LPAs Fremont and Tran were the only people who had used the home\u2019s visitor sign-in sheet and visitor temperature check log since March 2020 when the COVID-19 Pandemic started, because no other visitors were allowed to enter the home. (continued on LIC809-C)\n\nThis is contradicted by a photo of the home\u2019s Christmas Party on 12/24/2020, submitted to CCL over the course of this investigation. This photo shows S1\u2019s two young daughters, who are not residents or staff of the home, in the facility and in close proximity to clients in care. Additionally, over the course of investigations into complaints received on 10/19/2020, 12/02/2020, and 01/04/2021, CCL representatives have witnessed S1\u2019s daughters in the home during several virtual inspections. Based on the information above, the home has gone against its own COVID-19 visitation plan by allowing visitors into the home without obtaining a negative COVID-19 test, without having temperature checked upon entry to the facility as is required by CDPH, CCLD, and CDC guidance, and without having a symptom screening before entry. Simultaneously, the home has continued to not allow parents to visit their children at the home due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(5) \u2013 Personal Rights. Please see the attached LIC809-D for details. At this time, seven (7) deficiencies are being cited. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights discussed and provided, and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee/Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung with read receipt, to be signed and returned for the home\u2019s facility file no later than 5PM on Monday, 03/22/2021.",

The purpose of this meeting was to go over Plans of Correction (POCs) for recent deficiencies cited for the home and the home's Noncompliance Plan issued on 03/18/2021 to ensure the licensee is in full understanding of what will be expected over the next two years of their Noncompliance Plan. LPA Fremont met with Licensee/Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance were Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong, and LPA AmyLe Tran. Currently in care are 5 clients. LPA Fremont started this meeting by going over POCs issued for 3 complaints closed on 02/12/2021 and a case management on 03/18/2021. LPA Fremont asked the licensee if they had any questions or concerns about the POCs issued. LPA Fremont and LPM Wong reiterated that if POC due dates were not met, there is the possibility for Failure to Correct Civil Penalties to be assessed. This process was explained to the licensee. Next, LPA Fremont went over the home's Noncompliance Plan issued on 03/18/2021, and asked the Licensee if they had any questions, concerns, and if they were in full understanding of the requirements laid out in the plan. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee/Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung to be signed and returned over email no later than 5PM on Monday, 03/29/2021.",

    "narrative": "Allegation #1: Licensee is denying services ordered by a healthcare professional and in a client's needs and services plan. On 10/23/2020 at 12:03PM, LPA received a report from W1 from the Sunnyvale Development and Behavior Clinic at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University. This report is dated 05/30/2019 and details the medically necessary need for C2 to received her Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy. In this report, it is stated, \"Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder benefit from ABA therapy. It is imperative that teachers, group home providers, and parents address C2's significant communication deficits and behavior challenges in a consistent manner in all settings so that she is able to successfully integrate new skills. This includes the use of her AAC or communication device...\" This report also states that it is recommended that C2 continue medically necessary ABA therapy, and that the group home staff should receive training on how to assist with this service. Interviews with W1 on 10/23/2020 at 9:24AM and W2 on 11/20/2020 at 10:07AM both reiterate that ABA therapy was a medical necessity for C1 and C2. W2 added that both C1 and C2 have regressed heavily since COVID-19 started in March 2020 because they aren't able to receive their service. W1 also stated that the purpose of integrating ABA into the group home was for C1 and C2 to get better and to be able to be placed back in their parent's home. Upon review of the home's Plan of Operation/Program Statement by LPA Fremont on 11/05/2020, it was found that the home cites ABA therapy as a source of behavioral procedures that are used in the home including discipline policies. In interviews with S1 on 10/27/2020 at 11:07AM and S2 on 10/27/2020 at 11:52AM, both S1 and S2 stated the reason ABA had stopped being offered in the home was because the service was taking up too much space in the home, there were too many people coming into the home, the therapy resulted in too many unwanted behaviors, and the service was a distraction and disruptive to the other clients in care. S2 stated they did not see the benefit of having the therapy and any results seen in C1 and C2 were not due to ABA, but due to work done by the home and its staff. These statements from S1 and S2 are corroborated by interviews with W1 on 10/23/2020 at 9:24AM, W2 on 11/20/2020 at 10:07AM, T5 on 01/07/2021 at 10:34AM, W4 on 01/27/2021 at 3:35PM, and W3 on 01/27/2021 at 10:25AM. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nAll interviewees stated that the reason S1 and S2 gave for not wanting ABA in the home was that it was too many people and it was disruptive to the other clients in care. When asked if C1 and C2 were given a space in the home for ABA, W2 stated that they were confined to one bedroom or the garage, and being in the same space caused C1 and C2 to trigger each other and it didn't work out. W2 stated that at that time, there was a free bedroom at the home on weekdays that could have been used for another space to solve this problem, however S2 had stated the room was completely taken and could not be used. When asked if the group home staff participated in this therapy, W2 stated they tried to get the staff involved, however S1 did not agree and S2 told her they had 5 kids in care and couldn't handle it. In September 2019, Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB) came to a decision that medically necessary services were required to be offered at group homes. W1 and W2 both stated that when this was communicated to the group home, the group home send out eviction notices for C1 and C2. Both eviction notices were not followed through on, as RCEB did not agree with the evictions. After it was decided that ABA therapy could not be held at the group home, therapy was moved to C1 and C2's father's house, and he would pick up the clients from the group home after school every day to receive their service. This lasted until COVID-19 hit in March 2020, and services were discontinued. When COVID-19 hit, the ABA therapy service, JUVO, and RCEB offered extra training to the group home to be able to hold ABA virtually, however the group home staff refused because they stated they already had enough training and didn't need any more. Additionally, in an interview with T5 on 01/07/2021 at 10:34AM, T5 stated they never felt welcome in the home when they arrived for ABA. T5 also stated that part of ABA was to potty train C1 and C2, and learn how to use their talker devices. T5 stated that the home was never on board with potty training because they saw it as easier to keep the clients in diapers to avoid accidents. This is corroborated by a follow-up interview with W2 on 12/03/2020 at 3PM, who stated the group home was not meeting the client's toileting needs. T5 stated C1 would come to ABA at her father's house without her talker device, or would have it but it didn't have battery life, and the home expressed they did not want to have the talkers fixed when they were broken, giving the reason they did not need to use the talkers to effectively communicate with the clients. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nThis is corroborated by interviews with W1 on 01/15/2021 at 2:14PM, T2 on 11/18/2020 at 4:01PM, T1 on 01/26/2021 at 11:14AM, and T4 on 01/27/2021 at 2:07PM, who all stated that the group home is reluctant to utilize the talker devices with C1 and C2 because they believe they can communicate with the clients without the devices. T2 and T4 both stated that S1 has repeatedly cited technical issues as the reason for not using the devices, but S1 will not follow up or answer correspondence from the school district about getting the devices fixed. C1's IEP progress report also corroborates these statements, stating that without the talker, C1 has no way to effectively communicate with teachers or peers without assistance from the group home staff. Finally, T4 stated she was told by the group home that it was a liability to have the talker devices in the home, and the group home sent the devices back to the school district. Based on the information gathered, including records review and interviews, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation \"Licensee is denying services ordered by a healthcare professional and in client's needs and services plan.\" Therefore, the allegation is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 7, Section 84078(b) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Allegation #2: Facility did not have enough staff to meet the needs of the clients. In an interview with S1 on 10/27/2020 at 11:07AM, S2 stated that the group home as 5 staff on duty at all times, and C1, C2, and other clients are all on 1:1 supervision, with the exception of one client who is higher functioning and does not require 1:1 supervision. In an interview with W2 on 11/20/2020 at 10:07AM, W2 stated that all clients in the home except for one are on 1:1 supervision, meaning that each client has a staff with them at all times, except when they are sleeping, to assist with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). W2 stated that the home was investigated by RCEB in September of 2019 for being short-staffed, and that staff schedules submitted to RCEB do not match staff schedules submitted to Community Care Licensing (CCL). W2 stated that S1 and S2 have repeatedly expressed that the home is overwhelmed with 5 clients. W1 also stated that before COVID-19, they had traveled to the home and found 1 or 2 staff in the home supervising 5 clients. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nThese statements are corroborated by interviews with W2 on 12/03/2020 at 3PM, T1 on 01/26/2021 at 11:14AM, T4 on 01/27/2021 at 2:07AM, W3 on 01/27/2021 at 10:25AM, and W4 on 01/27/2021 at 3:35PM. W2 stated the group home does not have enough staff to meet the needs of its clients, specifically toilet training, communication, social skills, and education. T1 stated S2 has indicated to them that the home struggles to get all 5 of their clients online and on devices for school because they do not have enough staff. T4 stated the group home does not have enough staff to meet the educational needs of the clients. W4 stated that the home was understaffed at times, and they were informed S1 and S2 had to make up for coverage frequently. W3 stated that when ABA was being held in the home, staff had attempted to assist with the service but were unable to because the home was short-staffed. Finally, C1 and C2's 2020-21 IEP progress reports both not that staff are not available to help with online learning, and staff are not available to help with 1:1 activities for C1. Based on the information gathered, including interviews and records review, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation \"Facility did not have enough staff to meet the needs of the clients.\" Therefore, the allegation is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84065.5(c) - Staff/Child Ratios. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Allegation #3: Clients denied care and supervision for a week. In interviews with S1 on 10/27/2020 at 11:07AM and S2 on 10/27/2020 at 11:52AM, both staff were asked about camps that clients had attended in the past. S1 and S2 both stated that in the past, the clients had attended a camp for special needs kids in San Jose, CA, which was paid for by the parents. When asked what would happen if a client could not attend, S1 stated the clients would stay at the group home with staff, and S2 stated the clients could either stay at the group home or go home to their parents for the week. When asked what staff would do if clients weren't present in the home for those weeks, S1 stated staff were given the week off to have their own time, and S2 stated that staff stayed at the home on standby in case a client needed to be picked up from camp. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nIn an interview with W1 on 10/23/2020 at 9:24AM, W1 stated they were aware that C1 and C2 attended the camp once, and then stayed home with their parent the next year because it was too expensive for their parent to send them to camp. W1 also stated that the home instructed C1 and C2's parent to come pick them up for that week because no staff would be present at the home to watch them. This is corroborated by interviews with W2 on 11/20/2020 at 10:07AM, W3 on 01/29/2021 at 10:59AM, and W4 on 01/29/2021 at 11:23AM. W2 stated C1 and C2 went home with their parent for a week because they were told no staff would be present at the home, and it created a problem with payroll requests being submitted to RCEB when no staff were present providing care. W3 and W4 both stated that C1 and C2 could not afford to go to the camp in 2018, and S1 told their parent to take them home for the week because no staff would be at the home. Both W3 and W4 stated that during this specific week, staff were out of the home for a 3-4 day vacation in Los Angeles, CA, and staff received sick leave pay for these days off. Based on the information gathered, including interviews and records review, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation \"Clients denied care and supervision for a week.\" Therefore, the allegation is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80065(a) - Personnel Requirements. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Allegation #4: Facility did not provide appropriate clothing for clients. In interviews with S1 and S2 on 10/27/2020, both staff stated that clients in care are dressed appropriately by staff at the home, and they buy clothes for each client when they grow out of old ones. This is contradicted by interviews with T2 on 11/18/2020 at 4:01PM, W2 on 11/20/2020 at 10:07AM, and W3 on 01/27/2021 at 10:25AM. T2 stated that there was a period of time before COVID-19 when the group home would send C1 to school every day without a warm jacket. T2 stated this happened so often that they bought C1 a winter coat to use during recess and to keep at school so she could play outdoors and be warm, and T2 sent C1 home with the jacket to keep at the end of the school year. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nW2 stated in the past they have received emails from teachers that C1 and C2 were not dressed properly or their clothes did not fit properly, for example pants were too short or clothes were too tight. W2 also stated C1 and C2 are often dressed in clothing that is not appropriate for children of their age. W3 stated they recall a teacher reaching out because C1's clothes were too small for her. Based on the information gathered, including interviews, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation \"Facility did not provide appropriate clothing for clients.\" Therefore, the allegation is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(6)(A) - Personal Rights. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Allegation #5: Facility did not respond to responsible party in a prompt manner. In interviews with S1 and S2 on 10/27/2020 at 11:07AM and 11:52AM respectively, both staff were asked what the average turnaround time is for them to answer correspondence from clients' representatives. S1 responded it depends on the day and what they have going on, and that if they are on the road or busy, they tend to forget and come back to things later. S2 stated they try their best to respond right away, however they have 5 kids with different needs, and it becomes challenging. In response to LPA's inquiry regarding an overlooked email from C1's teacher about returning to in-person schooling, S1 stated that sometimes it looks like emails are marked as read so they don't open them, but that she eventually responded \"no\" to C1's teacher about returning to in-person schooling. This is corroborated by an interview with W1 on 10/23/2020 at 9:24AM, who stated C1's principal and teacher had reached out to the group home regarding C1 returning to in-person schooling starting 10/26/2020, and they they had not received a response from the group home until after the deadline to enroll had passed. In interviews with T1 on 11/17/2020 at 4PM, T2 on 11/18/2020 at 4:01PM, T3 on 11/19/2020 at 2:30PM, W2 on 12/03/2020 at 3PM, and a follow-up interview with T1 on 01/26/2021 at 11:14AM, all interviewees reported issues with the group home's communication. T1 stated that when they first started corresponding with the group home regarding C2's schooling, 6 days was the longest time her correspondence went unanswered. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nT3 stated they often send updates, questions, and other correspondence to the group home, and either receive sporadic responses or no responses at all. T2 stated they do not expect to get an answer from S1 for recent emails sent, and that prior to two weeks before their interview, all correspondence went unanswered. W2 stated there has been an ongoing issue with communication between the group home and C1 and C2's parent, as well as their teachers. W2 stated the reason for unanswered correspondence was never communicated to them by the group home, and that RCEB has continuously reminded the group home of their duty to respond to responsible parties. W2 added that C1 and C2's teachers, as well as one of their school principals has called the group home regarding the clients' school attendance, however they have never received a response to their calls. In T1's follow-up interview, they stated that they have not heard back about any inquiries into getting the clients' talkers fixed, and for general emails, they do not expect to get a response from the group home. Based on the information gathered, including interviews and review of records, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation \"Facility did not respond to responsible party in a prompt manner.\" Therefore, the allegation is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(4) - Personal Rights. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Allegation #6: Facility is not making accommodations for a child's schooling needs. In interviews with S1 and S2 on 10/27/2020 at 11:07AM and 11:52AM respectively, both staff stated virtual schooling has been overwhelming and challenging due to having 5 clients in care that go to different schools. S1 stated that there have been technology challenges, as well as communication barriers as all of the group home staff have English as a second language. S2 stated that if a client starts to show they are done for the day, they turn off the virtual school to avoid escalated behavior. Both S1 and S2 stated that a lot of the time when they sign on to Zoom for school, no one else is signed on so they turn it off. Both staff cited Wifi issues as another reason for the clients not signing on to virtual school. Finally, when asked about missing school assignments, S1 stated she was not aware of any clients having missing schoolwork. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nIn interviews with W1 on 11/10/2020 at 10:52AM, T1 on 01/17/2021 at 4PM, T2 on 11/18/2021 at 4:01PM, T3 on 11/19/2020 at 2:30PM, and W2 on 12/03/2020 at 3PM, all interviewees voiced ongoing issues with C1 and C2's school attendance and performance since the COVID-19 Pandemic started in March 2020. W1 stated that in a phone call with C2's teacher on 11/09/2020, the teacher reported C2 had several weeks of missing assignments, and that C2 was not being signed on to virtual school until 11AM daily, although school starts at 8:05AM. W1 reported that C2's teacher had also expressed concern for C1 and C2's attendance with the group home staff, and staff had responded that they were late for class every day because they were sleeping. T1 reported that C2 is usually signed on every day at around 11-11:30AM, just in time for music and activities. T1 stated C2 often did not have any staff sitting with her during virtual learning to help with the technology and prompting, and that C2 would just sit in front of the screen and smile. T1 also expressed concern that C1 and C2 will not meet their Individual Education Plan (IEP) goals, especially because they have never attended 1:1 speech or occupational therapy (OT) since the school year started. This is corroborated by T3, who stated that C2 has never attended individual OT, and that she doesn't see C2 in class enough to comment on missing work, stating, \"The fact that she hasn't joined sessions until very recently is concerning. It takes a lot of consistency to show progress and develop skills for her IEP.\" T3 also stated they are concerned that C1 and C2 have not consistently been accessing their education since the pandemic started. T3 stated at the beginning of the pandemic, they sent home interactive assignments for C1 and C2 to complete, and the assignments were never completed or turned in. T3 had a meeting with the group home to discuss ways to get C1 doing their work, and the group home told T3 they could not commit to the activities to work with C1 because it was too difficult to get her to complete virtual assignments. T3 reiterated that neither C1 nor C2 has shown up at all to individual speech therapy, which the school worked out for the two clients to have together to make it easier for the group home to get them online. T3 reported that staff have only started being present with C1 and C2 during group speech within the two weeks prior to their interview. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nFinally, T3 reported that the group home is not supporting C1 and C2 educationally or pushing them out of their comfort zone with their education, and she is worried about C1 regressing. W2 had similar concerns that the group home is not supporting C1 and C2's education and their needs are not being met. In an interview with T4 on 01/27/2021 at 2:07PM, T4 stated the group home does not say \"no\" to C1, and they don't require her to use her talker at the home, which is hindering the school's ability to work with her on it. T4 also stated that the group home did not want C1's talker back after having it fixed, which is hindering C1's IEP goals because she has no way to effectively communicate with her teachers. T4 went on to explain that the group home has expressed they will only commit C1 to 1-1.5 hours of school per day, and if she is having a bad day they will call it quits early or not sign on at all. At the beginning of the year, C1 was never in attendance for virtual learning, and the group home gave T4 the reason that they didn't want the teachers to see what was going on in the home or see the other clients, and that it was a privacy issue for them. T4 stated the home has also instructed her not to talk to C1 during virtual learning because it sets off C1's behaviors. Additionally, T4 stated the only time a caregiver is online with C1 is if there is a technology issue, and T4 will text the caregivers to come help C1. T4 ended their interview by stating the group home does not make C1 do things she doesn't want to do, they don't say no to her, and it is going to be an issue when C1 eventually returns to in-person schooling and the teachers can't give her everything she wants. All of the above is corroborated by C1 and C2's IEP progress reports and attendance records, submitted to LPAs over the course of this investigation. C1's attendance record for the fall semester states that between the dates of 08/14/2020 and 11/06/2020, there were a total of 65 instruction days, and C1 was absent for 26 of them, equaling a 40% attendance rate. All of these absences were unexcused. In C2's IEP progress report cites a similar trend. Of the total 83 days of instruction for fall semester, C2 was absent for 23 of them. In C1's IEP progress report, it is noted that 7/7 goals have minimal progress to report because \"C1 does not have her communication device for school because the group home does not encourage her to use it. They have returned the device to school. \" C1's progress report also states, \"C1 has not attended any weekly speech therapy sessions this year due to remote learning so there is no progress to report......\" (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\n\"....Staff in the group home indicates that they are not available for 1:1 activities needed to support tabletop material that would be less preferred. They do not make demands on their client that may trigger her, C1 has scheduled weekly OT sessions, attendance to sessions on Google Meet has been minimal.\" On the majority of C1's IEP goals, there is a comment stating \"Regression is expected.\" C2's IEP progress report has a common repeated comment on her IEP goals that states, \"C2 has only attended school virtually inconsistently for short periods of time. There is no data to report on at this time.\" For C2's speech therapy progress, it is stated, \"Progress is unable to be reported as C2 has not participated in speech sessions since the 2020-21 school year started. She has attended sporadically but has not had a person with her to facilitate communication.\" Based on the information gathered, including interviews and records review, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation \"Facility is not making accommodations for a child's schooling needs.\" Therefore, the allegation is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 7, Section 84078(d) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. At this time, pertaining to these 6 allegations, 6 deficiencies are being cited. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided and discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee/Administrator Reggieanne Villar-Battung with read receipt, to be signed and returned over email for the home's facility file no later than 11:59PM on Tuesday, 02/16/2020.",

    "narrative": "On 12/10/2020, LPA Fremont met with S1 over Microsoft Teams to notify them of these allegations, to request documentation related to the complaint, and to conduct an interview with S1. In an interview with S1 on 12/10/2020 at 1:05PM, S1 stated that both C1 and C2 are bathed twice daily, morning and night, and S1 stated that both clients have Self-Injurious Behaviors (SIBs) as part of their behaviors related to their Autism. S1 clarified that since COVID-19 hit in March 2020, both clients have had a significant decrease in the frequency of their SIBs. When asked if injuries sustained during SIB incidents are reported to a client's authorized representatives, S1 stated, \"If it needs to be reported, we would report it. If it is unusual we would report it. If it is just a scratch, we don't report it, unless there is a bruise.\" When asked if injuries sustained outside of the home are reported, S1 stated, \"we would report it. A bruise doesn't come out until hours later or the next day, but C1 and C2 are so light-complexioned so we see it right away and report it.\" This is corroborated by an interview with W1 on 12/14/2020 at 10:31AM, who stated that unknown bruises get reported to the clients' schools and parents to keep the circle of communication open and honest. S1 then stated that bruises, scrapes, and scratches would not be reported if they did not seem serious. LPA inquired with S1 about a CPS investigation at the facility on 01/15/2020, regarding unknown bruises and scrapes found on C1. S1 stated she and other staff checked C1 and C2 day and night, and hadn't noticed any injuries. S1 reiterated several times she never saw any bruises or scratches on C1 during the CPS investigation, and thought the CPS agent was testing her. This is contradicted by a series of text messages S1 sent to C1's parent on 01/15/2020 at 5:35PM, which were sent to report C1's bruises and scratches, and describe the shape and location of each injury. These text messages were sent to C1's parent before the CPS agent arrived at the group home to conduct their investigation on 01/15/2020 at approximately 6:45PM. LPA asked S1 if the bruises could have been the result of an interaction between C1 and her parent, and inquired if the parent was in town and took care of C1 and C2 in the days leading up to the discovery of C1's injuries. S1 stated she was sure the father was in town all week, and that the bruises could have been sustained at C1's dentist appointment on 01/15/2020. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nThis is contradicted by a screenshot of C1's father's flight schedules submitted to LPA Fremont on 12/17/2020 at 12:20PM, which show the father was out of town for work from the dates of 01/10/2020 to 01/14/2020. This is also contradicted by C1's dental appointment visit summary from 01/15/2020, which do not report any injury or behavior that could have caused C1's injuries. Finally, LPA asked S1 if any bruises or scratches were noted on C1 during bath time in the days leading up to the discovery of her injuries, and S1 stated, \"The bruises showed up later, or before, I can't remember. I think it was scratches maybe on the back or maybe...I don't know.\" Consumer Notes submitted to LPA Fremont by S1 on 12/14/2020 at 5:10PM show that between the dates of 01/01/2020 and 01/14/2020, C1 did not have any target behaviors, and no bruises or scratches were noted on C1's body. An entry on 01/15/2020 does not note any bruises or scratches on C1's body. An evening entry on 01/15/2020 notes, \"Staff shower C1 and notice a bruise on back of her body, lot of red scratches reported to administrator.\" An additional evening entry on 01/15/2020 states a CPS agent came to the home at 6:45PM to conduct an investigation. Interviews with W1 on 12/14/2020 at 10:31AM and T1 on 01/07/2021 at 10:34AM both confirm that C1 was found to have a series of large, finger shaped bruises around C1's left breast, a large bruise on her upper back near her shoulder, and bruises and scratches with swelling on the medial portion of C1's thighs. T1 also stated that when she discovered C1's bruises, C1 tried to hide them from her and seemed embarrassed and uncomfortable. T1 stated in her interview that there was no doubt C1's injuries should have been reported to CPS and C1's authorized representative. This is supported by an interview with T2 on 01/12/2021 at 1:37PM, who also stated there was no doubt the injuries should have been reported to CPS and the child's authorized representatives. Based on interviews and records review, the timeline of events for this incident are as follows: 1. C1's father is out of town from 01/10/2020 to 01/14/2020. C1 and C2 do not have Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy between 01/09/2020 and 01/12/2020, and their grandmother picks them up for ABA therapy on 01/13/2020. No injuries are noted during this time period. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\n2. The father returns from their business trip on 01/14/2020, and picks up C1 for ABA therapy at his apartment between 3 and 3:15PM. 3. During ABA on 01/14/2020, while teaching C1 about showering and picking out clothing, T1 discovers C1's injuries and reports them to the father. T1 calls T2 to confirm reporting requirement. 4. In the early morning on 01/15/2020, T2 instructs T1 to make a CPS report for C1's injuries. T1 makes the report in the early morning. 5. At approximately 4:30PM, CPS investigator W3 contacts the group home to inform them of the investigation and set up a meeting time at the group home. 6. At 5:30PM, S1 writes an incident report regarding C1's injuries, and notes that East Bay Regional Center, CCLD, and the father are notified. 7. At 5:35PM, S1 contacts the father over text message to inform him of C1's injuries and asks if they were sustained at the dentist earlier that day on 01/15/2020. 8. At 6:45PM, W3 travels to the group home and conducts a CPS investigation into C1's injuries. S1 later notes in her interview with LPA Fremont on 12/02/2020 that she did not notice any injuries on C1 during this visit. Finally, it was discovered that 5 incident reports dated between June 2020 and September 2020 were not submitted to Regional Center or CCLD until 10/30/2020. The timing of submittal of these reports violates CCLD's requirements that Incident Reports be submitted to the licensing Agency within 7 days of the occurrence of the incident. LPA was contacted by W2 on 11/20/2020 at 12:31PM, who confirmed that they had not received these incident reports until 10/30/2020. W2 stated that when they inquired with the home about incident reports being submitted months after the incidents, S1 and S2 stated that they had not had time to submit the reports due to COVID-19. The dates of these 5 incidents are a follows: 1. Two incident reports for incidents on 06/15/2020, written on 10/30/2020 and submitted to CCLD and Regional Center on 10/30/2020. 2. Two incident reports for incidents on 08/14/2020, written on 10/30/2020 and submitted to CCLD and Regional Center on 10/30/2020. 3. One incident report for an incident on 09/20/2020, marked as written on 02/19/2020 and submitted to CCLD and Regional Center on 10/30/2020. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nBased on the information gathered, including interviews, review of facility records, and review of records submitted by the reporting party, there is a preponderance of evidence to support that a lack of care and supervision resulted in C1 sustaining unknown injuries that went unnoticed by staff while in care at the facility. Therefore, the allegation \"Neglect/Lack of Care and Supervision resulting in a client sustaining unknown bruises\" is substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80078(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. Additionally, based on interviews and review of facility records, including incident reports, there is a preponderance of evidence to support that the Licensee did not report an incident in a timely manner. Therefore, the allegation \"Reporting Requirements: The Licensee did not report an incident in a timely manner\" is substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80061(b)(1)(E) - Reporting Requirements. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. At this time, two deficiencies are being cited. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights discussed and provided, and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee Reggieanne Villar-Battung with read receipt, to sign and return over email for the home's facility file no later than 11:59PM on Tuesday, 02/16/2021.",

    "narrative": "During an announced 10-Day Complaint Investigation Inspection with the facility on 01/06/2021 at 2:00PM, LPAs Madi Fremont and AmyLe Tran notified the facility about the complaint, and conducted an interview with S1 regarding the allegation. LPA's inquired about which staff were living in the home at the time, and S1 initially responded 3 staff were live-in, then later changed her answer to 4 staff, as she had forgotten about one of them. LPAs asked S1 to clarify how many staff were living in the home, and she stated that there were 5 staff living in the home, plus her and her three family members (Assistant Administrators) who work at the home but did not reside in the home, for a total of 9 staff. S1 also stated that the live-in staff routinely traveled outside of the home to run errands, pick up groceries, and pick up donations for the home. LPAs asked if the staff were routinely getting tested for COVID-19, and S1 responded that they would get tested if they experienced symptoms, but no one had been tested yet because no staff had experienced symptoms of COVID-19. This is corroborated by interviews with W3 on 01/27/2021 at 3:10PM, and W4 on 01/29/2021 at 2:33PM, who both stated staff are not being tested for COVID-19. LPAs asked if the home was allowing any visitors at that time, and S1 stated they were not accepting any visitors since March of 2020 due to COVID-19. LPAs asked for a copy of the home's visitor sign-in sheet with temperature check, and S1 stated that the LPAs were the only visitors that had come to the home since March 2020, when they traveled there to open an unrelated complaint on 10/27/2020. When asked what the home did to celebrate the recent holidays, S1 stated that the home had a Christmas Party with clients and staff at the facility. LPA Fremont asked S1 to clarify who was in attendance at this party, and S1 reiterated it was just clients and staff present at the party. These statements by S1 are contradicted by a photo submitted to LPAs Fremont and Tran on 12/25/2020 at 10:51PM, which shows S1's two daughters, who are not residents or staff of the home, in close proximity to the clients of the home. This is also contradicted by a statement from W2 on 01/07/02021 at 12:38PM, who stated they travelled to the group home on 12/24/2020 at approximately 5:00PM to drop of Christmas gifts for a client. W2 stated that upon their arrival at the group home, S2 greeted them at the door. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nWhen S2 opened the front door, W2 looked inside the home and observed a large gathering of approximately 12-15 people, adults and children, in one room together. W2 stated that they knew the staff of the home well and did not recognize several of the adults who were inside the house. W2 also observed S1's daughters inside and in close proximity to the clients. This is corroborated by an interview with W3 on 01/27/2021 at 3:10PM, who stated that S1's daughters were present at the Christmas Party on 12/24/2020. On 10/27/2020 during a visit to the home for an unrelated matter, LPAs Fremont and Tran provided S1 and S2 with CCLD Provider Information Notices (PINs) that detailed the use of masks in residential facilities. LPA Fremont strongly encouraged the home to require the use of masks for all staff. On 11/04/2020 during a virtual Case Management Inspection to discuss the facility's COVID-19 visitation plan with California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Nurse Emma Erickson, LPA Fremont and Nurse Erickson strongly encouraged S1 to enforce mask usage in the home, due to concerns from parents. On 11/12/2020 during a Case Management Inspection to discuss the home's visitation policy with CDPH Nurse Barbie Henson, Nurse Henson strongly encouraged the use of masks in the home. During this meeting, due to repeated concerns from parents, LPA Fremont warned the Licensee that action would be taken by CCLD if masks were not mandated in the home, as LPAs had asked on several occasions which staff were live-in, and had not yet received a definitive answer. During S1's interview on 01/06/2021, LPAs inquired if staff at the home are required to wear masks while in the facility, to which S1 responded they were required to wear masks in the home in keeping with Contra Costa County Department of Public Health COVID-19 guidelines. This is contradicted by the following: 1. During an unrelated Complaint Investigation Inspection at the home on 10/27/2020, LPAs Fremont and Tran were greeted at the front door by S2. Both LPAs observed that S2 did not have a mask on, and does not reside at the group home. S2 put on a mask when LPAs entered the home. 2. A photo taken on 07/23/2020, submitted to LPA Fremont on 10/27/2020 at 3:16PM. This photo shows staff without masks in close proximity to clients of the home during C2's birthday party. One of the staff shown in the photo does not reside in the home. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\n3. A video taken on 09/27/2020 and submitted to LPA Fremont on 10/27/2020 at 3:19PM, which shows staff without a mask in close proximity to C1. 4. A video taken on 11/26/2020 and submitted to LPA Fremont on 11/30/2020 at 3:40PM which shows staff without masks in close proximity to clients of the home. 5. An interview with T2 on 01/26/2021 at 11:14AM, in which T2 stated she observed staff of the home without masks 25-30% of the time. T2 stated that when the staff did wear their masks, they either had them under their noses or under their chins. 6. 3 photos submitted to LPA Fremont on 01/27/2021 at 11:45AM, which show C1 with staff during C1's 1:1 session at 9:40AM on 01/27/2021. In these photos, the staff is not wearing a mask and is in close proximity to C1. 7. 1 photo submitted to LPA Fremont on 01/28/2021 at 10:12AM, which shows C1 in her morning 1:1 sessions with staff in close proximity with her mask under her chin. T2 and T2's teaching aid both reported that the staff was coughing throughout the session. 8. 1 photo submitted to LPA Fremont on 01/28/2021 at 10:16AM, which shows C1 in her 1:1 class from 01/27. In this photo we can see staff without a mask in close proximity to C1, and a male staff in the background without a mask and in close proximity to a male client. On 01/06/2021, LPA Tran asked S1 how she was ensuring that her non live-in staff were being safe and following COVID-19 safety protocol outside of the home, and S1 responded that she and her three relatives (Assistant Administrators of the home) practiced social distancing inside and outside of the facility and remained at least 6 feet away from all clients at all times. This is contradicted by two photos submitted to LPA Fremont on 12/24/2020 at 6PM, which show C2 in close proximity and in contact with S1, with C1 standing next to them. This photo also shows one of S1's daughters on S1's lap, and the other daughter standing next to the group. The second photo shows staff without a mask in close proximity to clients and in the same gathering space as S1's daughters. While S1 and her children are wearing masks in these photos, this goes against the facility's COVID-19 Visitation Plan, submitted to LPA Fremont on 11/09/2020. In this plan, the facility maintains that visitors must test negative within 7 days of coming to the home, visitors must remain 6 feet apart from clients, and if physical contact occurs with a client, the client will be sent home to quarantine for 14 days and may only return after showing a negative COVID-19 test. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\nThis Christmas Party held by the home, as well as their use of PPE in the home and the presence of unauthorized visitors are in violation of several CCLD, CDPH, and Contra Costa County Department of Public Health (CCCDPH) Safety Guidelines related to COVID-19. LPA Fremont has sourced the following documents from the CCCDPH, CDPH, and CCLD websites: 1. In a CCCDPH document titled \"Holidays and COVID-19,\" it is stated that residents of the county should not gather with other households, all gatherings should take place outdoors, and residents and staff should wear masks around people that are not from their household. 2. A document titled \"Regional Stay At Home Order\" released by CA Governor Gavin Newsom on 12/03/2020 stated that all gatherings with members of other households are prohibited, taking effect on 12/05/2020. 3. A document released by Contra Costa County on 11/12/2020 titled \"Memo Re: Long-Term Care Facilities and Residential Care Facilities Guidance for Visitation, Activities, and Outings Based on County Tier\" states that all indoor and in-room gatherings are prohibited for counties in the Purple Tier, which Contra Costa County was in at the time and remains in at this time. 4. A document released by Contra Costa County on 06/26/2020 titled \"Order of the Health Officer of Contra Costa County\" which states that all visitors not working in the facility shall submit to a temperature screening prior to entering the facility. This document also states that all staff members shall cover their nose and mouth with a face covering while in the facility, and all staff members and visitors to the facility should stay at least 6 feet apart from other persons. 5. A document released by CDPH on 11/13/2020 titled \"CDPH Guidance for Prevention of COVID-19 Transmission for Gatherings\" which states that the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19 increases with laughing, singing, loud talking, and difficulty maintaining social distancing, gatherings must be held outdoors for counties in the Purple Tier, gathering space must be large enough that everyone can maintain at least 6 feet of distance from those not from their household, and face coverings must be worn, with the exception limited to eating. (CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C)\n\n6. A combined PIN and All County Letter (ACL) released by Governor Newsom on 08/13/2020 titled \"PIN 20-19-CRP/ACL: Clarification of the State's Face Covering Order in Children's Residential Facilities\" which states children and staff are to wear face coverings when members of the public are present. This document also stated that masks are required when staff are interacting with members of the public in any room or enclosed area where other people (excluding healthy members of their own household) are present and unable to physically distance. This document states that providers are strongly encouraged to stay up to date on the specific mandates of their local health departments relating to face covering and social distancing, and to follow accordingly. 7. PIN 20-27-CCLD released on 11/23/2020 titled \"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection Control Guidance for Celebrations and Outings\" which states that face coverings are required, a distance of 6 feet should be maintained from all other people who aren't part of your household, and to plan activities that limit mixing between different households. 8. PIN 20-12-CRP Released on 06/22/2020 titled \"Public Health Guidance Related to COVID-19 for Home-Based Care and Congregate Care Facilities in Child Welfare Practice\" which advises planning activities that do not require close physical contact, advises against planning large group activities, advises to eliminate family style meals and avoiding congregating, and states that each group activity should be limited to 10 total people, including staff. Based on the information gathered, including LPA observations, interviews, and records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the allegation \"Facility did not provide a safe environment for clients in care\" is found to be substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84065.2 (b)(1) - Personnel Duties. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. At this time, one deficiency is being cited regarding this complaint. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided and discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee Reggieanne Villar-Battung to be signed and returned for the facility's file no later than 11:59PM on Tuesday, 02/16/2021.",

Agency stated that the high increase of restraints are due to specific clients that have violent behavior towards staff and other clients. Both clients have been given discharge notice and only one remains in the facility awaiting to be discharged. The intake process and compatibility procedures conducted prior accepting placement. Agency stated that the intake procedures are thorough and much consideration is given to accepting placement including if the client is a good fit for their program. The documentation included in Incident Reports (IR) should be trauma informed and contain all necessary information prior to and after the restraint is administered. De-escalation techniques utilized prior to the restraint should be clearly documented in the IR. Licensee agreed to include more detail in describing the behaviors that warranted a restraint.

    "narrative": "On 01/19/2021 a second informal conference was conducted virtually between Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives and Mountain Valley administration to discuss concerns regarding restraints. CCL representatives included Regional Manager Margo Castaneda, Licensing Program Manager Daniel Allmon, Licensing Program Analyst Danielle Walker-Flores and Licensing Program Analyst Kellie McKinely. Mountain Valley administration included Rene Van Der Meer Program Manager, Dan Petrie CEO, Michelle Bonner Program Director, Al Petrie Director of Program Development, and Jai Hanes Training Specialist. Stephanie Ivler from the Alliance and Aimee Foster Investigative Analyst Foster Care Ombudsman Office were also present. The concerns discussed include the following: Restraints -high number of restraints conducted in October and November. Licensee stated that the high number of restraints were due to a few clients and not a representation of the overall program. Staff S1 (see confidential names titled 01/21/21) S2, S3 and S4 being involved in more restraint incidents than the other staff. Licensee explained that often, specific staff will respond to a restraint call. S1, S2, S3, S4 also work in an area on the Ranch where the most restraints are conducted due to behavior of the clients. \u00b7 Use of Supine restraint - Licensee agreed to submit an addendum to their program statement and add in the Supine restraint. Emergency Intervention Plan Biannual Review. Licensee agreed to send CCL the reviews from 2019 and 2020. Documentation requested by CCL should include: 15 minute checklist, biannual review of 2019 and 2020, Debriefing checklist, addendum of program statement to include Supine. CCL requested the removal of the solo person basket restraint due to safety concerns. Licensee requested further review of regulation to continue the use of the solo person basket restraint. As of 02/11/21 there is no current identified regulation prohibiting the use of solo person restraint as long as the restraint is consistent with the height and weight ratio requirements specified in the program statement. The height and weight of the client and staff performing the single person basket restraint is to be submitted with the incident report if Licensee continues the use of the solo restraint.",

LPA reviewed facility roster, staff schedule, daily activity calendars and incident reports. Complaint alleges that facility is understaffed. All six clients interviewed stated that the facility is understaffed. Consistent statements from clients indicate the clients feel that there are more serious incidents and a lack of activities, due to the facility not having enough staff. Consistent statements from staff indicate that the Agency does not provide enough staffing to meet the needs of the clients and staff are left out of ratio. Staff stated on several occasions they would be left alone to supervise a house of six clients. Both clients and staff stated they feel unsafe due to the facility being understaffed. Both clients and staff stated that incidents could be avoided if the facility were staffed properly. (continued on 9099C)",

    "narrative": "On 8/1/23 about 10:45 AM, Licensing Program Analyst, LPA Uchenna Ajaero paid an unannounced case management visit to the facility and met with the Special Education Teacher to discuss the Needs and Services plan for FC1. FC1 is a freshman, FC1 takes physical science, algebra, biology, health, language arts and other subjects including PE and career development. Career development includes gardening, wood chop, horse care - feeding, grooming and walking them. With better abilities some of the youths can ride the horses. FC1 has 5 academic and PE and career classes totaling 7- classes daily. Julian the House Administrator and Zachary the Therapist are not in the facility today So, we could not review FC1's Needs and Services Plan. Special Ed Teacher said the educational plan for FC1 is getting to school on time and solving daily problems while in the school. FC1 expresses mental challenge when they see work but FC1 is currently working with the Special ED Teacher to stay on task. When FC1 is anxious or stressed, FC1 will ask for a break or complain of headache, but returns and will try to rush through the rest of the work but Special Ed Teacher would slow FC1 down to set them back on track. Special ED Teacher is also working with FC1 to use complete sentences and articulate more words better. The teacher stated that FC1 has gotten better over time. Youth is not aggressive in the classroom and they do not experience FC1's behavioral problems or challenges. Teacher thinks FC1 respects the teachers and so the behaviors arise after school and on weekends. FC1's only behavior during school is FC1's trying not to get their school work completed. The teachers addresses these and FC1 sits very close to the teacher during school hours. No deficiencies were found during this visit. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was left with the facility.",

LPAs conducted a walk through of the facility with FM and observed the following: four client rooms in clean/orderly condition, two client bathrooms with working toilets, sinks, and showers. Clients' bathrooms sinks and showers were not clean. In one clients room there was a hole in the wall, which the maintenance staff filled in during this inspection. Client's water sources measured at 114.4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within the required range of 105 degrees Fahrenheit and 120 degrees Fahrenheit. There were no sources of water dedicated to extreme heat. The carbon monoxide detector and smoke detector were operational. There was an adequate amount of food for the required amount of time, both perishable and non-perishable foods. Items to make today's scheduled dinner were present in the facility. There was an adequate amount of silverware, dishware, and cooking items. There were extra bedding items, hygiene supplies, and personal items. All medications and cleaning supplies were locked and inaccessible to clients as required. The license and personal rights were posted as required. The staff office was locked and inaccessible to clients. The First Aid Kits met all requirements. The outdoor activity space met all requirements. There is a swing-set outside which had the required safety material underneath. The swing-set was anchored to the ground as required. LPAs reviewed the facility's Operations and found: Initially the Client roster was not complete but was completed and posted with clients' names, DOBs, Authorized Representative, and Medical Provider information by FM during this inspection. The facility has a valid fire clearance. Board Meeting minutes were provided which demonstrated that the board is meeting as required at least quarterly and discussing the required topics. Facility did not have current license posted, however LPAs provided it and it was posted.\n\nAll staff were fingerprint cleared and associated as required. LPAs reviewed one Facility Manager file and a partial Administrator file and found the following: FM had initial training as required, however we found the files are disorganized and inconsistent, which made it difficult to determine how many hours of training staff had. The Administrator's certificate expired last month, however Administrator has already paid for renewal and the process is pending. Administrator and Facility Manager both meet education and experience requirements. FM's first aid/CPR certificate expired on 10/6/2024, however during this inspection, FM completed the certification and provided the certificate. LPAs interviewed two Clients and found based on these interviews, that the facility is meeting their needs as far as food, therapy, clothes, telephone calls, school, allowance and activities. LPAs were unable to complete the inspection on this date and will return another day to complete. On this date, there were no citations issued. LPAs issued multiple Advisory Notes, which are not citations. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to FM.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Michelle Silvas and Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced annual inspection at the facility and met with Facility Manager (FM), De'jana Crockett who assisted with the inspection. LPAs reviewed two staff, the FM, the Clinician, and the Administrator files and found the following: All staff had medical screenings and TB tests completed as required. S1 had 19.75 hours of annual training, which is below the 20 hour minimum annual requirement. All other staff, FM, and Administrator met training hour requirements. Administrator's First Aid/CPR expired 9/30/2024, however she does not provide direct care to the clients. Administrator will be renewing the CPR/1st Aid. Additionally, FM's CPR/1st Aid expired 10/6/2024, and she completed the renewal training during yesterday's inspection on 10/29/2024. During the review of training records, the initial training records are maintained in multiple different documents: 13015A Initial Training Requirements, Relias, 13027 New Hire Training Procedure. The items listed are not titled in a way that would enable LPAs to evaluate whether all the required topics of this section have been trained on, and there were no training descriptions with contents attached. Staff are receiving many hours of training on different topics, however the titles do not all make clear what the contents of those training are. For example, \"In Person Annual Part A\" and \"Part B\" covers many topics, but they are not listed to evaluate. After being advised of this, the facility put together a sheet with most subsections of 84065(i)(3) in relation to their training titles, which demonstrated to LPAs that the topics are being covered. The facility will fine-tune this list, title it, and maintain it in each staff's file. The facility utilizes a newer Emergency Intervention program called \"Ukeru: The Least Resistance Approach to Crisis Management.\" The facility needs to submit a program statement update to CCL for review of this new plan, and approval. This will be due in 60 days on 12/30/2024. LPAs also reviewed the disaster drill log and found that drills are being conducted as required, however they are all fire drills, and not a variety of disaster types as required. Additionally, there have not been drills for the overnight shift. LPA has discussed the process for completing these previously with Administrator Misty Jackson, and during this inspection with FM. The facility will begin to implement these additional drills as required for the overnight shifts.\n\nLPAs reviewed the facility's Disaster/Mass Casualty Plan and found the following: there was no information regarding the provision for emergency power, no for storage of medication which would require refrigeration. Additionally, the phone numbers listed were out of date, confirmed by FM. LPAs reviewed four client files. One client (C4) was only placed for one week before returning home for an undetermined amount of time. C4 is still placed but has not been back at the facility for two months, therefore C4 does not have a medical assessment completed, TB test, signed Needs and Services Plan (NSP), and other required documents. If and when C4 returns to the facility, the facility will complete these requirements. C3 also did not have a TB test as there was confusion from the parents as to whether or not C3 already had one, so the facility will be completing that next week according to FM. All clients had an NSP with the required elements, however, there were no authorized representative signatures for all four NSPs. All clients had a face sheet with client information as required, however, C1's nickname was not listed as required, and four out of four clients did not have their preferred pronouns listed. All four clients take Psychotropic Medications, however four out of four clients were missing parental consent to take psychotropic medications as required. The facility did have general medical treatment consent forms, which were signed by the authorized representatives. C1 and C3 did not sign their personal rights forms. C1 also did not sign their discharge/transfer policy, complaint procedures, or discipline policy. LPAs reviewed all four clients' medications. The facility is maintaining Psychotropic Medication Administration Records (PMAR) with all psychotropic medications separate on their own PMARs as required. During the review, LPAs found the following: two pills of C4's Medication 1 (M1) were taken and not documented on the October 2024 PMAR. FM stated it was most likely documented on the September 2024 PMAR, which was not available for LPA to review due to being removed from the facility, and stored at the Gerber facility. FM informed LPA that no one at Gerber could access them to provide to LPA as the nurse is not available, and Administrator Kamiko Lucas is off-site.Due to this, LPA is unable to confirm that medication counts and PMARs are completed accurately. For C3, the same issue occurred where LPA could not accurately verify the medication counts due to September 2024 not being available at the time. FM was able to attain the September PMARs from the Administrator and provided them to LPAs. LPAs reviewed them and they did document that medications were administered in September, it still did not clarify when new bubble packs began and ended, and it was not possible to decipher accurate counts. C2's M2 PMAR stated the amount prescribed was 23, however 29 slots were signed off on as having taken a dose in the PMAR. For C2's M3,\n\nthe MAR stated there were 30 prescribed, however the bubble pack stated there were 31. C2's M4 was a 100 pill supply, however all 100 pill supply was not available for review, as the extras were with the nurse, and inaccessible on this date. LPA explained to FM the troubles they were having reviewing the medication and FM acknowledged the issues present. LPA advised FM of different ideas to help correct these issues. LPA Silvas interviewed two staff and found that they were knowledgeable about the clients, their roles, and mandated reporting. On this date the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6. Chapter 5, Sections: 84070(b)(16), 84070(c)(1) and Health and Safety Code Section 1565(a) on the attached LIC809-D page. LPAs also issued multiple Advisory Notes, which are not citations. LPA conducted an exit interview with FM and a copy of this report, confidential names list, and appeal rights were provided to her.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Jodean Hall made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility and met with Facility Manager (FM) De'jana Crockett, who assisted with the inspection. The purpose of this inspection is to complete the Case Management opened on 2/9/2024 pertaining to multiple reports of self-harm by client C1 (see Confidential Names List dated 6/26/2024). LPA investigated this case management by reviewing Incident Reports (IRs), hospital discharge paperwork, Needs and Services Plans (NSPs), a Safety Plan/Behavior Contract, the facility\u2019s Program Statement, and by conducting confidential interviews with one client, two staff, and the Facility Manager (FM). On 2/9/2024 LPA requested all hospital paperwork from each time C1 went to the hospital/ER/Urgent Care for self-harm behavior from placement to present (at the time, 2/9/2024). Review of hospital paperwork and associated IRs showed that the facility did not submit all the requested hospital paperwork, nor did they submit any of the facility documents requested on 5/3/2024. On 6/5/2024, CCL sent a follow-up request for these documents, and CCL received them on 6/6/2024. Based on IRs and Hospital/ER Paperwork: For self-harm related incidents, C1 was taken to the ER at least 14 times between 9/10/2023 and 4/5/2024, was held for at least 24 hours for safety 12 of those times, had at least two X-Rays conducted, and had at least four endoscopy procedures to remove ingested foreign bodies while in placement. Sedation was used during endoscopic procedures. The 1/5/2024 hospital discharge paperwork advised C1 to have, \u201cclose watch supervision at group home,\u201d and, \u201cno access to sharp items for ingestion.\u201d The facility IR for this incident stated that when C1 was discharged on 1/6/2024, C1 was placed on close watch, their room was searched,\n\nand potentially harmful objects removed for safety. However, on 1/8/2024, C1 was able to ingest a broken pen and hard plastic reusable straw. When the two staff present for that incident were interviewed, neither could remember how it happened, and one staff stated C1 was on 1:1 supervision for that week. LPA was informed by the Facility Manager on 2/9/2024 that the facility recently implemented a sign-in/sign-out sheet for clients checking out items that need to be checked in, specifically in regard to C1. LPA received a copy of this form on 2/13/2024. However, on 2/26/2024, C1 was able to self-harm with an object staff failed to collect back from them. During the facility visit on 2/9/2024, while conducting the walk-through of the facility with FM, LPA observed a plastic rat-tail comb with a sharp-pointed end in C1's hygiene supplies, which fits the pattern of items C1 ingests. LPA advised FM to remove the rat-tail comb from C1's hygiene supplies. After reviewing C1\u2019s Behavior Contract obtained on 2/13/2024 and 6/6/2024, LPA noted that there were no updates to the plan, no identified risks, sources of support, or documented coping strategies. Since placement in the facility, C1\u2019s NSPs clearly stated C1\u2019s self-harm behaviors have resulted in multiple hospitalizations. There was one NSP update in 2024 which had no meaningful updates to address C1\u2019s continued dangerous self-harm behavior. For NSPs dated 11/17/2023 and 2/9/2024: for the sections concerning mental health and emotional needs, both the presenting issue and plan to address it were copied and pasted, unchanged. In the case of all NSPs for C1, the plans to address C1\u2019s mental health and emotional needs never changed nor were updated. C1 had one Safety Plan for the duration of placement, which was undated, and was a copy of a safety plan from the ER. The facility\u2019s Program Statement states in the Emergency Intervention Plan that, \u201cWhen clients present an imminent or immediate risk to self or others by acting out physically, they are no longer thinking rationally so the strategy must change from deescalation to keeping everyone safe.\u201d In nearly all incidents of this investigation, staff never switched from verbal intervention to body positioning, or any form of manual restraint, despite C1 being in imminent danger due to self-harm behaviors. In C1\u2019s Clinician\u2019s Orders dated 4/23/2024, it states that C1 should receive the appropriate level of restraint during self-harm incidents.\n\nAdditionally, Administrator Kamiko Lucas informed LPA they do not conduct Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings with the clients placed through the schools, but rather Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meetings. LPA reviewed the IEP for C1 and found that it is a meeting conducted annually, and the one on file was last updated on 5/4/2023, which pre-dates C1\u2019s placement in Mountain Valley on 5/30/2023. Other IEPs were held during placement, however copies are maintained by the school district. The IEP mainly focused on school needs and progress, however also identified mental health needs and areas of concern for C1 as they relate to C1\u2019s education and employment goals. The facility\u2019s Program Statement states updates to NSPs take place during IEP Meetings at least once every 30 days of placement. Interviews with two staff revealed that staff would just watch clients self-harm and not physically intervene, due in part to management stating, \u201cswallowing stuff wasn't imminent danger.\u201d Also, a staff stated the administrators would call C1\u2019s self-harming behavior, \u201cattention-seeking.\u201d One staff informed LPA that C1 was placed in the same house with another client who is a known trigger to C1. This was known by staff and management, yet the client was still placed at the facility temporarily which resulted in another self-harming incident on 11/29/2023. Based on LPA\u2019s investigation, LPA found that there was a clearly demonstrated pattern and history of C1 becoming escalated and self-harming via ingestion of foreign bodies. C1 would often appear safe in one moment, and self-harm in the next moment. C1 repeatedly got access to harmful objects and self-harmed with them. Staff returned objects back to C1, some of which C1 had previously self-harmed with. Staff failed to ensure potentially harmful objects were collected from C1 on multiple occasions, leading to C1 ingesting them. Staff failed to increase the level of intervention in nearly all incidents, and failed to conduct IEP meetings as needed, failing to follow the facility\u2019s Program Statement and Emergency Intervention Plan. The facility\u2019s continuous negligence and inaction with interventions led to C1 being repeatedly harmed. An immediate civil penalty in the amount of $500 is being assessed for this serious deficiency on today\u2019s date.\n\nOn today's date LPA and LPM requested access to a staff file (S1) however, it was not accessible to staff or LPA and LPM. FM called Administrator Misty Jackson to see about getting access, however the HR personnel left the office at 2:00 PM due to an emergency, and no other individuals have access. Administrator stated she will provide the staff file to LPA by tomorrow 6/27/2024. There was also no facility manager present when LPA and LPM arrived. There were two clients being supervised by a staff who has been an employee at the facility for one month or less. Another staff was present on the grounds, however was not present in the facility. That staff was hired about 7 months ago. Neither staff had knowledge about licensing or how to get information. FM did return during this inspection and assisted LPA and LPM. On this date, the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Sections 80078(a), 80022(k), 80044(c), 84068.3(a)(3), 84065(d).

LPA was sent the past year's worth of restraint logs after LPA left the facility yesterday. LPA reviewed them and found the facility is documenting the restraints. LPA reviewed four electronic client files with the assistance of Nurse Dominique Stephens, Therapist Jenn Potts, and HR Director Michelle Milhous (HR). LPA found there were the appropriate consents, including psychiatric medical consents. There were records of Mental Health Services being received by clients, which included their diagnoses and goals and objectives. All clients had separate Psychotropic Medication Administration Records as required for all their psychotropic mediations, with all required information. Two clients out of four have had a wellness exam as required, however only one has received a TB test or assessment as required. There have been issues with out of County insurances, however, one client is from Stockton, which is not unreasonable to drive to to take the client to a doctor's appointment. That client was placed in June 2023, and now has a doctor's appointment scheduled for October 2023. Three out of four clients have a record of vaccinations, and the fourth client does not as their parent has not sent it to the facility, despite the facility requesting it multiple times. The two clients who received a wellness appointment had paperwork from those visits that did not satisfy the requirements and were missing multiple required elements on them. LPA showed Nurse where to access CCL's LIC 602 form, which has all the required information on it. LPA recommended the nurse have the doctors fill that form out during wellness exams in the future. In the event a medical provider refuses to fill out a form, LPA is advising the facility document their efforts.\n\nLPA found that one out of four clients had initial Needs and Services Plans. All clients have been placed longer than 30 days. However, there is no specific deadline for when to complete an initial NSP by in the regulations for Group Homes. A best-practice is completing it within 30 days of placement. LPA advised Therapist to complete them as soon as she can, and she agreed. LPA received the Board Meeting minutes for the last four quarters and found the Board is meeting as required. No clients had an Admission Agreement, and the facility stated they had never been asked for that for client placed through school or Managed Care. A bedroom sharing compatibility assessment is not documented for any clients who share bedrooms. SPD Kamiko Lucas stated that she, the assigned clinician, and the assigned house supervisor do this, however it is not documented. Regarding fingerprint clearances, only one staff is still In-Process on Mountain Valley Bar Du's old STRTP License. One staff's determination has been closed. CCL has held the old license open to allow In-Process fingerprints on the old license to go through and be able to transfer to the new Group Home license. HR agreed that the staff can be reprinted under the new license. LPA will the close out the old license HR agreed. HR also informed LPA that they do not have access to the new license in Guardian to be able to transfer associations to the new license. LPA witnessed this on HR's Guardian page; only the old Bar Du license was available. LPA advised HR to inform Guardian of this to have it addressed. Currently the agency is fingerprinting new hires under the Gerber license and will transfer the associations to the Bar Du Group Home license when they have access. LPA informed HR that those new staff cannot work at the Bar Du location until they are associated/transferred to Bar Du. HR agreed. All staff LPA reviewed on this date were associated as required. LPA reviewed five staff files, including one Administrator, one Clinician, one Facility Manager, and two staff. LPA found: The Facility Manager met experience/education requirements, however the dates of employment were missing from one of the reference checks. LPA and HR were able to find in the application the dates worked. LPA observed\n\nthe facility has a Facility Manager Training which meets requirements, however there was no evidence that any Facility Manager has taken it. There was no evidence of a Prudent Parent Standards training being given to staff who would be able to apply that to day-to-day decisions surrounding the clients. LPA observed that all staff received their TB tests, and Health Evaluation visits as required. All staff reviewed have received Emergency Intervention Training. All staff files have job descriptions, records of fingerprint clearances, training records, education or experience records if required, and records of first aid/CPR. On this date, the facility is being cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Sections: 84065(d)(3), 84068.1(b)(4)(A), 80069(a), and 84069.1(a). LPA is issuing three Technical Violation Advisory Notes, which are not citations. LPA was unable to complete this inspection on this date. LPA will return to the facility on another date to complete medication review, cash resources review, and to interview staff and clients. An exit interview was conducted with SPD and HR. A copy of this report and appeal rights was left with them.",

    "narrative": "On 04/21/2023, the Department received a complaint alleging allegations of personal rights toward clients. It was alleged that clients are not being treated fairly by staff, staff are threatening the clients using a point system to delay their unification, and staff are interfering with religious services towards a specific client population of not being taken to a Mosque. The Facility Senior Lead Supervisor (FLS) and other staff workers denied the allegations. FLS stated that all clients are treated equally and with respect. FLS stated that the facility uses a point system but never affects the client\u2019s reunification process. FLS stated that it is impossible to threaten a client to delay reunification with family members or with a sponsor. FLS and other staff workers provided consistent statements and denied interfering with the clients\u2019 religious practice of attending a Mosque. FLS stated that clients that requested to attend a Mosque were honored before, during, and after Ramadan. FLS disclosed that all clients are being accommodated based on their needs, such as food service, clothing, and other religious services. In confidential interviews, LPA Vargas interviewed clients of different ethnicities from different cottages. All clients that were interviewed provided consistent statements and denied the allegations. One Individual identified as other who had specific information about the allegations reported could not be contacted after several attempts were made to obtain a statement. U.S. Federal Field Specialist (FFS) denied all of the allegations reported. FFS stated that she meets with a wide variety of clients of different ethnicities and religious beliefs, and they (clients) have never made any complaints to her about the staff at New Beginnings. FFS commented that the facility representative and others have experienced some form of interpersonal communication. FFS has no concerns with the care and supervision of the clients at New Beginnings. Interviews and documentary evidence produced do not corroborate evidence to support the allegations. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the agency representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection.",

A serious medical procedure request had to be submitted by the facility to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) on 8/29/24 due to minor needing additional treatment for wisdom tooth extraction. The process for the wisdom tooth extraction took longer because the request was initially denied and when it was approved, there were challenges in obtaining the earliest available dates for an oral surgeon. Throughout the process, the minor was informed of ongoing daily contacts by the facility with ORR and dental providers so minor understood the protocol involved in ensuring his medical need is met. Minor's wisdom tooth extraction was completed on 10/24/24. The minor reported eye irritation to staff on 9/19/24. However, on 9/20/24, the minor denied any eye pain or irritation when a facility medical assistant followed up with the minor regarding the reported symptom. The facility still submitted a treatment authorization request to ORR on 9/24/24, so the minor can be seen by an optometrist. The facility obtained a vision appointment for the minor and was seen on 10/1/24. The minor was given a prescription for glasses. Confidential interviews supported the information from documents reviewed. Minor was only concerned about the length of time the dental issue was resolved and denied that other medical needs were not met by the facility.

Davis went to New Beginnings on August 29, 2025 at 11:50am in order to conclude the follow up on an incident report that was received by Community Care Licensing on May 23, 2025. Various follow ups were done to obtain additional facts and information. LPA met with Francisco Guerrero, Assistant Program Director and Gerardo Salazar, Lead Counselor Supervisor, and discussed the incident. The incident report stated that another minor touched minor's private area. During the course of the investigation, LPA obtained information that the incident allegedly occurred at school in 2024. The facility was made aware of the incident May 2025 and reported it forthright. The investigation revealed that child #1 (refer to Confidential Names form (LIC 811) dated August 29, 2025) was sitting in the basketball area during a school restroom break and child #2 (LIC 811) allegedly touched child #1 in the groin area with a closed fist. Child #1 reportedly informed school officials. Information obtained indicates that the incident was not observed by any school personnel. School officials decided to make classroom adjustments. Based on a review of documentation, information, and facts obtained in this matter, the Department has determined that there is no evidence or information that the facility failed in its responsibility to provide care and supervision. School officials, out of an abundance of caution, made classroom changes and made sure that the two children maintained their distance from one another. Both minors are no longer placed at the facility. The Department has concluded that the situation has been stabilized and no further follow up is necessary. Exit interview done",

Per AB2944, the Department will only be able to extend the provisional license to a maximum of 24 months in order for the licensee to obtain Accreditation, MediCal Certification, Mental Health Approval from County and Mental Health Contract with DHCS so that the licensee can obtain a permanent license. Currently, the licensee is unable to locate any county to work on a Mental Health Approval with them and this will result in possible closure of the facility. During this meeting, LPM Yeung urged licensee and placement county representatives to work together and reach out to their respective mental health department to provide a mental health contract to licensee to avoid the need to provide a closure plan in September.\n\nSince issuance of provisional license, New Destiny has worked to secure a Mental Health contract and Medi-Cal Certification with no success in or out of their host county. Currently, the facility is providing Mental Health services through the Presumptive Transfer process. Follow up actions were discussed during the meeting as follows: - Dr. Powell will follow-up specific contacts with counties. New Destiny will initiate meetings with counties and Dr. Tatum-Martinez can help facilitate the meetings to help move the contracting process. - Dr. Tatum-Martinez will follow-up meeting with Kern County to discuss feedback and barriers that New Destiny is facing in obtaining mental health contract. - County Representatives, Ms. Garcia-Martinez and Ms. Saff will follow-up with their team in Behavioral Health for opportunities for contracting mental health with New Destiny. During the meeting, it was discussed and agreed that licensee will provide an update to this department by the end of the following week (5/27/2022). The licensee will initiate contacts and meetings with mental health departments of all possible counties they work with to obtain mental health contract and will notify LPA Silva if there are future meetings so that CCL and Catalyst Center representative can participate and provide support. A copy of this report was provided to NDYF\u2019s Director, Dr. Catherine Powell, after the meeting.",

Per Dr. Powell, Madera County has yet to move forward with contracting mental health. During the meeting, Dr. Kelsie suggested for Dr. Powell to contact Santa Clara County to inquire about possibilities for contracting mental health. Dr. Kelsie will set up a meeting with San Bernardino again for other opportunities for contracting mental health and inquire about possible exemption to their 50-mile radius restriction. Last year, New Destiny\u2019s mental health proposal was rejected by San Bernardino due to facility not being located within the 50-mile radius from the border. LPA will conduct follow-up calls with provider and Catalyst Center regarding updates on these meetings. The meeting ended at 10:45 AM.

Confidential interviews revealed that staff have not been heard or observed to threaten clients in care. In reference to the allegation that staff yelled at minors, a confidential interview disclosed that S1 yelled at C1, but no additional information or details were provided. Confidential interviews revealed that facility staff have not been heard or seen yelling at clients in care. Confidential interviews did, however, reveal that a school teacher has yelled at clients, but the teacher is not part of the residential program.

Discussions between C1 and S1 were about multiple sexual partners, attraction(s) between C1 and S1, \"love being expansive and impossible to compartmentalize\", being \"fluid and undefinable at times\", and C1 or S1 having emotionally involved communications between them. One of the messages uncovered stated \"we have a connection & we care about each other\". The allegation that staff engaged in conduct that is inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of clients in the facility is related to this inappropriate contact, conversations and communications between C1 and S1. In addition, Investigator Burton received information that C1 and S1 were found by a third party sleeping clothed together in the same bed at least one time and a picture showing that C1 and S1 in clothed and in bed together (not the same incidents). S1 was told that C1 may have had a crush on S1 but S1 did not stop the inappropriate messages or communications and even admitted that communications between C1 and S1 were emotionally involved. As a result of the interviews conducted, documentation reviewed and investigation conducted, the allegation that staff had an inappropriate relationship with client in care and staff engaged in conduct that is inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of clients in the facility are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. Facility cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 84072(d) Personal Rights. Investigation shows that S1 carried on an inappropriate relationship with C1 that appeared to be emotionally abusive in nature. These discussions included content of a sexual nature and were inappropriate as the nature of the relationship was that of care provider/mentor and youth in care. Facility cited for violation of Health and Safety \u00a71569.58(a)(2) Officers, directors and employees of licensed facility... Investigation shows that staff engaged in conduct that is inimical to the health, morals, welfare or safety of an individual in or receiving services from the facility, or the people of the State of California as it relates to the inappropriate contact, conversations and communications between C1 and S1. Exit interview conducted with Ms. Patterson and document provided.\n\nWhen interviewed, C1 alleged that the relationship between C1 and S1 was \"intimate and very sexual\" but denied there was sexual intercourse or penetration or other contact of a sexual nature. C1 denied that C1 and S1 ever kissed but did make statements about inappropriate touching over the clothing that could not be corroborated. As a result of the interviews conducted, documentation reviewed and investigation conducted, the allegation that staff had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a client in care is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to Ms. Patterson.",

An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, along with the appeal rights were explained to Program Manager Ellen Asquith. Due to printer malfunction, this report will be emailed to Program Manager Ellen Asquith.\n\nConfidential interviews resulted in inconclusive information as to how long C1 was left unattended in regard to whether it was age and developmentally inappropriate or not. Confidential interviews also revealed that C1 did not obtain the medication from the medication room at the facility. Based on confidential interviews, and records reviewed, the allegation that C1 overdosed while in care due to a lack of supervision is unsubstantiated. Meaning, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, along with the appeal rights were explained to Program Manager Ellen Asquith.

    "narrative": "On February 19, 2005 at 10:15am, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Gilbert Marquez conducted an inspection with the facility for the purposes of doing an annual inspection. LPA Marquez met with Program Manager Monica Garcia, and conducted a full plant inspection of the facility buildings and grounds. The census is 0 and there were no youths who were residing on the premises.According to Joe Viccaro, Executive Director, the facility ceased intake of clients as of December 27, 2024. LPA Marquez stated that Community Care Licensing (CCL) had not been given a written notice that the facility was pausing its operations. A written statement from the LIcensee is required to state the date the \"pause in intake\" occurred, and give the expected date of resuming intake of youth to be served at this facility. The physical plant inspection started with the \"UR Building\" where youth can have space for downtime and a break. Currently the back yard is not available due to painting renovations at the \"Main Building.\" The UR building has a bottom floor where the youth bathroom is located. The bathroom hot water temperature was measured at 105.8 degrees, which is within regulatory requirements. All hazardous items have been properly made inaccessible in areas where clients will not have access. Cleansers/chemicals are locked and stored in a locked cabinet in one of the locked staff offices. The First Aid Kit is located on the second floor and contained all required supplies; the tweezers are located in the locked staff office downstairs. The building had one smoke/carbon monoxide detector in the hallway, and were checked and were operable. There are no guns or weapons in the facility as stated by Program Manager. The following required posted items were observed accessible to clients: Facility License, Grievance Procedures and Personal Rights. The disaster plan and visitor policies were in storage at Main building due to the renovation painting. Emergency exits were free from obstruction in the UR building. Cont. on 809-C\n\nThe backyard was not available to youth during the painting renovation. However LPA Marquez and Program Manager Garcia did a walk through of the yard space. LPA observed that there are no signs giving caution about the prominent eastern hillside on facility grounds, and neither are there hand rails. LPA and Program Manager inspected the \"old tree house\" and the abandoned chicken coop. Both small buildings are accessible by walking on a steep upward hill walkway made from both wooden beams on the ground and large rock tiles. The facility will be given a type B deficiency and asked to have a Plan of Correction submitted to LPA Marquez to resolve this issue, see LIC809-D for specific regulation and deficiency summary. The Main Building was inspected and LPA Marquez observed that all rooms were being repainted, and all cabinets were being repainted. The courtyard of the Main Building was not an accessible walkway due to being currently renovated. Its renovation will be completed in the near future and before clients are residing in the Main Building. All the staff files are stored and secured digitally. LPA reviewed 3 staff files. One staff, Program Manager Monica Garcia was interviewed. All the staff have met the training and qualification requirements per regulation requirements. Per a review of the Community Care Licensing Information System (LIS), all staff met DOJ/FBI criminal record clearances and Child Abuse Index Check requirements. Based on the facility inspection, and files reviewed there was one deficiency, type B given for hazardous area accessible in the backyard of the facility. An exit interview was conducted with Program Manager Monica Garcia, and a copy of this report was explained and provided to her, and emailed to Crystal Goodwin, Regional Licensing and Compliance Manager of Newport Healthcare.",
