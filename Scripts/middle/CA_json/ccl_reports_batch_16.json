    "narrative": "The Following Allegation was reported: 1. The staff hit a minor in care. The Licensee (S1) refuted the claims, asserting that they do not condone physical or verbal abuse as a disciplinary method. Instead, S1 prefers to incentivize positive behavior through rewards or by revoking privileges such as access to electronic devices. S1 further elaborated on their active participation in their children's daily lives, ensuring that they provide all necessary support for the children's success. S1 mentioned having a discussion with FC1 about the discrepancies in FC1's academic performance and emphasized the significance of honesty regarding their after-school activities for safety reasons. A statement from FC1 confirmed that they felt secure and enjoyed living in the SFH with S1. However, when questioned about the alleged incident, FC1 claimed that S1 had punched them in the stomach and kicked them in the leg after FC1 admitted to struggling with their grades. FC1 could not provide additional details about the incident and stated that no one else was present at that time. FC2 also denied the allegations, stating that they had never witnessed or heard S1 engage in any form of physical or verbal abuse within the home. FC2 further clarified that while they were in their room, they overheard a conversation between S1 and FC1 regarding academic issues, as their rooms were adjacent, but they denied witnessing any physical altercation. Information gathered from S2 and S3 indicated that S1 is highly engaged with the children, frequently taking them on trips and assisting FC1 and FC2 with their homework as needed. Additionally, the findings from the Bakersfield Police report # GO# 2024-215730 indicated that the discrepancies in the accounts provided by both FC1 and FC2, coupled with the injuries not corresponding to a fist impact to the abdomen, led to the conclusion that there was insufficient probable cause to arrest S1 for child endangerment under PC 273a. Furthermore, FC1 has not expressed any issues regarding residing in the SFH residence and has shown a willingness to return to the home. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Licensee. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the Licensee.",

    "narrative": "Allegation: Caregiver over medicates Ref. #2 - The LPA observed a letter from Ref. #2's doctor that indicated that the Caregiver took Ref. #2 to the Emergency Room on May 19, 2023 and Ref. #2 was medically cleared. The letter indicated that Ref. #2 had been on the prescribed medication for years. An interview with the CSW Supervisor indicated that one particular medication was the cause of Ref. #2's issues observed at school and that Ref. #2 was taken off it after a Child and Family Team Meeting with all the parties. There was no evidence provided that the Caregiver over medicated Ref. #2. The LPA observed no issues with the Psychotropic Medication Administrator Record (MAR). Allegation - Caregiver does not ensure that client is properly fed - A review of the Psychological Evaluation conducted February 17, 2022 indicated Ref. #2 suffered with an eating disorder. The interview with the CSW Supervisor indicated that the medication that Ref. #2 takes made Ref. #2 sleepy and Ref. #2 was not eating. The Supervisor stated that this was the medication that was stopped. The LPA toured the SFH and observed a sufficient supply of perishable and non-perishable food. The LPA observed nutritious meals on the menu. Ref. #2 indicated that they get enough food to eat and is able to get any food from the kitchen that they want. Allegation - Caregiver does not ensure client's hygiene is being met. The Caregiver indicated that there was a complaint, because Ref. #2 wears hair long and dresses in a gothic style. There were statements that Ref. #2's clothes were dirty, hair long, obstructive and unwashed. The LPA observed the client to be clean, dressed in a t-shirt and shorts. Ref. #2 indicated that they shower and wash their hair daily. The LPA observed the SFH to be cluttered with furniture, but observed it to be sanitary without hazards. Allegation - Caregiver does not ensure client is meeting academic needs. The LPA observed a Graduation Status Notification indicating that Ref. #2 had not completed all of the credits to graduate, but Ref. #2 has an IEP which outlines Ref. #2's learning disability. The CSW Supervisor indicated that since Ref. #2 no longer takes that one medication that was causing problems, Ref. #2 has improved at school. The LPA is unable to corroborate the allegations. There was no preponderance of the evidence to substantiate the allegations. So, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding these allegations. A copy of this complaint was provided to the facility representative.",

Additionally, the confidential interview stated that FC1 was acting out and throwing things around the house and jumping on the furniture. A confidential interview disclosed that licensee was mean to FC1, and foster mother attempted to hit FC1 with a shoe. In regard to licensee not allowing the foster child to leave the home, a confidential interview stated that FC1 attempted the leave the home by attempting to exit out the garage door. The confidential interview stated the door was blocked to prevent FC1 from exiting the home. However, FC1 was able to run to the front door and exit. Confidential interview stated the FC1 was not able to be located and the police was called and FC1 was later found by the police. A confidential interview stated that licensee/foster mother was mean to FC1 which resulted in FC1 running out of the house. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that licensee threaten to throw an object at FC1 and licensee is not allowing FC1 to leave the home may have occurred or may be valid, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the allegation.

FM stated that FC1 didn\u2019t tell her anything. FM pointed out that when FC1 wandered away, her ex-husband was not there that day, therefore, this allegation could have occurred during the prior weeks. Ex-H admitted that he called FC1 a wimp because FC1 was picking on the girls. CSW stated that she was not aware of the comment and explained that FC1 didn\u2019t mention anything to her regarding any inappropriate comment as FC1 called her almost every day. The CSW mentioned that FC1 had a history of making falsehoods. Other confidential interviews did not provide any information. Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been me and the allegation that Ex-H made inappropriate comment towards FC1 is substantiated.

Aborchie arrived unannounced to Memorable SFH to initiate the investigation, interviewed licensee (LS) and conducted a health and safety inspection with licensee (LS). There were no immediate safety hazards observed at this time of inspection. In addition, LPA M. Chavez interviewed foster children (FC1, FC2, FC3 and FC4) and obtained copies of Needs and Services Plan, and a summary of Optometrist visit. LPA Chavez conducted additional interviews with licensee (LS), staff #1 (S1). LPA M. Chavez was unable to contact County Social Workers. In regard to the above allegation that licensee made numerous threats to evict minor as a mean of discipline, it was specifically reported that foster mother was always threatening to put in a 14-day notice to kick FC1 out if FC1 did not behave or listen to her in the way she expected or being disrespected by FC1. During investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that the threats to be evicted only occurred when FC1 was first placed at the SFH. Another confidential interview disclosed that evicting FC1 was not a threat or means of discipline but rather a conversation. Confidential interview explained that the conversation was to explain FC1 their rights to be placed elsewhere and that FC1 would have their support regardless of FC1\u2019s decision. The confidential interview continued explaining that it was later mutually decided between LS and FC1 that FC1 would stay at SFH. Regarding licensee did not get prescription glasses for minor, a confidential interview disclosed that FC1 did not receive glasses for two to three months after losing them. In another confidential interview, it was disclosed that FC1 did not inform LS that FC1 lost their glasses until two to three months later, but when LS was informed about the glasses, she immediately made an appointment for FC1 to get new glasses. A confidential interview stated that LS had to pay out of pocket for glasses due to FC1\u2019s insurance only covering new glasses every two years. (See LIC9099-C)\n\nIn regard to the allegations that licensee yelled at minor and did not treat minor with dignity nor respect, it was specifically alleged that foster mother has blown up and yelled at FC1 at least four times causing FC1 to cry. A confidential interview disclosed that LS would yell a lot when FC1 was first placed at the SFH, but then later LS got the yelling under control and eventually stopped. In another confidential interview, it was disclosed that LS and S1 both have loud voices, and their tones often are perceived as yelling. A confidential interview disclosed that they have not witnessed LS treating or dis-respecting FC1 or any other foster children. LPA didn\u2019t receive any additional information. In regard to the above allegation that licensee does not pick up FC1 from school in a timely manner and it was reported FC1 has had to wait up to two hours for a ride during hot summers and cold winters repeatedly. During investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that the longest FC1 has ever waited for a ride was at the most, thirty minutes but was informed ahead of time. Another confidential interview disclosed that when LS is running late to pick up FC1 that LS always gives FC1 the option to wait, get an uber, or arrange for someone else to pick FC1 up. LPA received a conflicting information. In regard to the above allegation that LS did not provide FC1 with hygiene products specially soap. A confidential interview disclosed that FC1 does not like to shower nor brush their teeth and FC1 used falsehood during a meeting that soap was not available. Another interview disclosed that the facility has plenty of hygiene products that are unlocked. Another confidential interview indicated that when they run out of hygiene products, they just have to ask LS or S1 to provide hygiene products. LPA received a conflicting information.

LPAs were unable to interview child 2 and 4 (C2 & C4) due to C2 and C4 being non-verbal. In regard to the allegations that licensee does not prevent a minor from walking around nude while in care and licensee does not prevent a minor from engaging in inappropriate interaction with another minor. It was specifically reported that C2 walks around the SFH late at night nude and one-night C2 tried to get in to bed with C3 while nude. Multiple confidential interviews disclosed that after C2 goes to bed for the night that C2 will then take their clothes off and walk to the restroom during the night naked. In addition, confidential interviews disclosed that C2 now has one on one supervision to ensure C2 doesn\u2019t leave their room naked and there are now doorbells on C2\u2019s bedroom door which make a sound when C2 leaves their room during the night. Multiple confidential interviews disclosed that C1 and C3 lock their door at night to avoid C2 from going in their room. In addition, multiple interviews stated that C2 has never harmed any clients and the time C2 went into C1 and C3\u2019s room was an accident. Regarding the allegation that licensee does not provide adequate transportation for a minor, it was specifically reported that LS does not pick up C1 from school and that LS has C1 take Uber home. During confidential interview, it was disclosed that C1 had to take an uber home on a few occasions where LS was running late to pick up but as of November 2024, C1 has not had to take Uber home and that LS is on time to pick up C1 from school. In addition, a confidential interview disclosed that during a child family and team meeting LS disclosed that during situations where LS was not able to get C1 on time from or to school then LS would use Uber and C1\u2019s social worker nor any other participants in the meeting stated Uber was unacceptable. In regard to the allegation that licensee screams at a minor, it was specifically reported that LS screams at C1 for falling asleep on the couch. During multiple confidential interviews, it was disclosed that LS does not scream at C1 or any other clients in care. Other multiple confidential interviews disclosed that LS has a naturally loud voice but does not yell at C1. LPA did not receive any further details.\n\nBased on interview and record review, the allegations that licensee does not prevent C2 from walking around nude while in care; licensee does not prevent C2 from engaging in inappropriate interaction with another minor; licensee does not provide adequate transportation for C1; licensee screams at C1 may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations, therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

    "narrative": "****Continued from LIC 9099**** Regarding the allegation that foster parents do not prevent physical altercations between minors, it was specifically alleged that FC2 punched FC1 numerous times in the face while in the car. Confidential interviews stated FC1 taps or hits other children in care to get their attention. Another confidential interview indicated that FC1 tapping or hitting can be perceived as aggressive. Confidential interview disclosed that while the foster children were in the car, they started engaging in altercations and staff pulled over to separate them, and staff resolved the issue to prevent another altercation. Based on confidential interviews and file reviews, the allegation that foster parents do not prevent altercations between minors may have happened or are valid, however, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were explained and provided to Memory Beaumier.",

CCL also received the allegation that the licensee (S1) and adults (S2) made inappropriate comments towards a minor (C1), and that the licensee (S1) mistreated a minor (C1) while in care. It was reported that C1\u2019s caregivers called C1 a \u201cdevil,\u201d and told C1 to \u201cshut up,\u201d that C1\u2019s parent is mentally ill and does not want C1, that C1 does not act normal, and for C1 to \u201csuck it up\u201d while upset. It was also reported that C1\u2019s caregivers interrupt C1 while C1 is trying to express themself, punish C1 for crying, and blames C1 for things they don\u2019t do. A confidential interview indicated that S3 made fun of C1 for their weight and called C2 several hurtful names; however, no third-party witnesses to these incidents were named and C2 was unable to be interviewed on this allegation. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that C1 had a close relationship with adults in the home and did not report any mistreatment to CSW or CASA while living in the home. Confidential interviews indicated that S1 raises their voice at clients for misbehaving; however, one of the interviews provided contradictory information and disclosed that S1 uses appropriate forms of punishment. CCL also received the allegation that the licensee (S1) did not prevent a minor (unnamed) from damaging another minor's (C1) personal belonging. It was reported that another client in the home stepped on and ruined C1\u2019s family photos. A review of C1\u2019s emails indicated that C1\u2019s family photos were damaged by another client and that C1 was told to \u201csuck it up\u201d when complaining about it to their caregivers. A conflicting confidential interview indicated that it was S1 and S2 who stepped on and ripped C1\u2019s photos, not another client; however, no third-party witnesses to this incident were named. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that the licensee denied communications for a minor, the licensee and adults make inappropriate comments towards a minor, the licensee is mistreating a minor while in care, and the licensee did not prevent a minor from damaging another minor's personal belonging are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "...CONTINUED A confidential interview indicated that S2 and S3 began attacking C1 for an unknown reason, including jumping on and punching C1, which lead to C1\u2019s nose being broken. Conflicting confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that C1 became escalated and attacked S2 after having their tablet taken away, leading to C1 being placed on a psychiatric hold at the hospital, and that C1 did not have injuries indicative of abuse. Records reviewed indicated that C1 has a history of unexpected violent behavior towards caregivers and staff. A confidential interview indicated that S1 threw a shoe at the head of another client in care, C4; however, conflicting information was gathered during this interview and the shoe throwing was disputed by a named witness. Confidential interviews indicated that other clients in care have not experienced physical abuse or been made to feel uncomfortable by S2 or S3. CCL also received the allegation that the licensee (S1) verbally abused a minor (C1) in care, the licensee (S1) threatened a minor (C1) in care, and the licensee (S1) discriminated against a minor (C1) in care. It was reported that S1 and other adults in the home verbally abused C1 with demeaning language related to weight, mental disabilities, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, as well as threatened harm. A confidential interview indicated that S3 made fun of C1 for their weight, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, and that S1 called C2 several hurtful names; however, no third-party witnesses to these incidents were named and C2 was unable to be interviewed on this allegation. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that C1 had a close relationship with the adults in the home and did not report any mistreatment to their county social worker or CASA while living in the home. Confidential interviews indicated that although S1 utilized individualized interventions and care, S1 treated clients equally and upheld consistent rules. CCL also received the allegation that the licensee prevented minor from reporting incidents while in care and that the licensee (S1) retaliated against minor (C1) in care. It was reported that C1 alleged neglect and abuse by S1 and other adults in the home and, as a result, S1 took C1\u2019s tablet away and was verbally abusive and threatening to C1. A confidential interview indicated that there were no disciplinary consequences, such as C1\u2019s iPad being taken away, or other forms of retaliation due to C1 alleging neglect or abuse; however, the same interview indicated that C1 was not allowed to have private phone calls and had to be near facility staff while using the phone. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that clients in care were allowed to make phone calls in private areas of the home, such as their bedrooms. CONTINUED...\n\n...CONTINUED A confidential interview indicated that S1 would often refuse C2 the facility phone; however, there was no additional information gathered to corroborate this assertion. CCL also received the allegation that the licensee (S1) did not seek medical attention for a minor (C1) in care as necessary, and that the licensee (S1) did not ensure that a minor (C1) received necessary services while in care. It was reported that C1 was not being properly treated for an ongoing medical condition while living with S1, as well as not receiving needed mental health services or school accommodations. A confidential interview and records reviewed indicated that C1 required daily medication and at one point while living with S1 needed an appointment with a specialist. Confidential interviews indicated that S1 took C1 to their required medical appointments and provided C1 with their medication daily. A confidential interview indicated that S1 would sometimes forget to provide C1 with their medication, and that C1 would have to remind S1; however, no corroborating information for this assertion was gathered. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that C1 was also diagnosed with mental health conditions requiring treatment and therapy. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that while living with S1, C1 received wraparound mental health services that carried over from their previous placement, and that once the services ended S1 submitted referrals at various locations for C1 to remain in therapy and receive services. Confidential interviews indicated that there was a gap in services during this time, but that C1 was still receiving mental health services through their individualized education plan. CCL also received the allegation that the licensee (S1) leaves minor(s) in care unsupervised and that an uncleared adult had access to minor(s) in care. It was reported that C1 did not receive adequate supervision and was left unattended with adults who were unauthorized to be supervising C1, including S1\u2019s spouse. A confidential interview indicated that C1 was regularly left alone at S1\u2019s home without adults, as well as left alone with S1\u2019s family members. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that some of S1\u2019s family members assisted in supervising and caring for C1, and that everyone who lived in the facility had criminal records clearance, including S1\u2019s spouse. A confidential interview indicated that C1 was left alone twice with another relative of S1 without criminal background clearance. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that C1 was not supervised by any of S1\u2019s relatives without criminal background clearance. CONTINUED...\n\n...CONTINUED CCL also received the allegation that the licensee\u2019s (S1) conduct posed a risk to minor(s) (C1) in care. It was reported that S1 took C1 on an unnecessary trip out of state despite C1 being medically fragile. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that C1 was not considered medically fragile while living with S1. A confidential interview indicated that while travelling C1 felt healthy and was provided with their normal medication. It was also reported that another client in the home was allowed to provide illicit drugs to C1; however, C2 was unable to be interviewed on this allegation and no corroborating information was gathered during the investigation. A confidential interview indicated that S1 and other adults in the home did not strive to keep C1 safe; however, no further details were provided. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that S1 and other adults in the home work to keep clients in care safe and protect their personal rights.

Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that S1 enforced house rules and took other supervision measures to prevent inappropriate interactions involving C1 and to ensure safety of clients in care due to C1\u2019s history of sexualized behaviors and fixating on foster siblings of the opposite sex. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that the licensee did not prevent inappropriate sexual interactions between minors is unsubstantiated.

Ms Norris stated that she did approach the City of Pasadena to inquire if she needed any permits and she was told that she did not because the work being done to her home is solely cosmetic not structural. The only things being changed are paint and plaster. Ms. Norris stated that the children are protected from the renovation materials.

Youth explained that it\u2019s also the youth\u2019s choice to stop attending school. Youth acknowledge that youth\u2019s treatment team constantly provides guidance and support to ensure youth\u2019s safety and well-being. FP denied the allegations and explained that youth spends time outside the home with FP, staff/alternate caregiver and with individuals from youth\u2019s treatment team. FP follows the youth\u2019s safety plan due to youth\u2019s known unsafe behaviors. FP contacted law enforcement and the placement agency once it was discovered that youth left the home. FP reached out to youth\u2019s therapist and school personnel when youth started refusing to take medication and attend school. There were multiple meetings held to support the youth and ensure that youth\u2019s goals are met as identified in the youth\u2019s treatment and safety plans. Additional information obtained during the investigation revealed that FP went above and beyond to ensure that youth is always safe. FP maintains effective communication with school personnel, placement agency staff and other members of the youth\u2019s team. Despite this, youth refused to follow through with the youth\u2019s placement preservation plan. Based on information obtained, the allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is no preponderance of evidence found to support it. The following reports were provided to the facility representative at the conclusion of today\u2019s inspection: LIC9099, LIC9099-C and LIC811 Confidential Names.
