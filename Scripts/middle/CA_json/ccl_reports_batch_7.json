Upon completion of the visit, a cook arrived who LPA was informed would be working on evening meals and snacks. It was also reported that the facility was out of ratio. Confidential interview revealed that youth in care have special health care needs, and more than 1 staff are available to clients. Due to inspection being during afternoon hours, there were no clients at the facility during the visit. At the time of the inspection, although clients were not present, there was a staff member available. Additionally, S2 arrived 30 minutes later and assisted with inspection and interview. Based on confidential interviews and LPA observations, the allegations that the facility had a lack of food, and the facility was out of ratio may have occurred or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was reviewed with Deliaha Martin, Administrative Director. A copy of this report, and appeal rights were provided by signed confirmation. .",

    "narrative": "Youth admitted to being physically aggressive with staff after youth was not initially allowed to do laundry. Youth explained that although youth hit staff, staff responded by hitting youth, resulting in an eye injury. The injury was observed by school staff which led to youth explaining the incident leading to youth\u2019s eye injury to school and law enforcement personnel. Staff corroborated the series of events leading up to the physical altercation but denied hitting the youth. Staff admitted to holding on to youth\u2019s hands to prevent youth from continuously hitting staff in the eye, until youth was able to calm down. Staff denied observing any injuries to youth after the incident. Staff sustained an eye injury as a result of being hit by youth. LPA reviewed the medical report and photos pertaining to youth\u2019s eye injury. Other records show consistent information regarding the events prior to the physical altercation. However, youth gave varying accounts of how staff reacted during the physical altercation. At the time of the incident, only one other youth, who is non-verbal, was at the facility but this youth was in another room and, per statements from staff and youth, did not witness the incident. Regarding staff holding the youth\u2019s hands down, staff was preventing the continuous physical assault by youth towards staff and was redirecting youth to stop the assault and to calm down. Youth eventually calmed down and was able to proceed in completing youth\u2019s requested task. Based on the above information, the allegation is unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met. A copy of this signed report, the Confidential Names and Appeal Rights forms were provided to the facility representative. No deficiency citation was issued.",

Confidential records reveal that youth became verbally aggressive towards staff after being told that youth cannot do laundry due to a scheduled tele health session. At the end of the tele health session, staff went to the youth\u2019s room and informed youth that youth can do laundry. Youth responded by punching staff several times in the left eye. Staff held on to youth\u2019s hands and asked youth to calm down. Both individuals fell on youth\u2019s bed where staff continued to hold on to youth\u2019s hands until youth calmed down.",

LPM Logan Shanks began the meeting by reviewing the complaint details and findings. LPM Logan Shanks also shared that during the time of the incident, the facility was not out of ratio since there were two staff and 3 children present. The guidelines state that there should be one staff present for every 3 clients unless a higher level of supervision is required by the placement agency. LPM Logan Shanks asked the facility what their plan moving forward so that a child leaving the facility unnoticed, doesn\u2019t happen again? The facility responded by stating, they knew the child was gone and as a result, the facility called the police, which is why the police knew where to bring the child once the child was found. The facility also mentioned that the day that the child left the facility, they placed alarms on the windows; as there were already alarms on the front and back door. Further, the facility shared that they appealed the substantiated findings on 3/6/25 because the LPA that substantiated stated the facility needed a one on one for the child that left the home, but the facility states the child doesn\u2019t warrant one on one services. Additionally, per Yahweh, CCL confirmed receipt of the appeal. LPM Logan Shanks stated the facility should receive a response to the appeal in the month of April 2025. The facility currently has 4 children in placement. page 1 of 2\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, Yahweh GH shared that they had exit audio alarms on the windows and as a result of the incident, they immediately installed exit alarms on the doors.

On 11/21/2022, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received allegations that staff are conducting restraints which are not in their program statement, staff are not recording medication distribution appropriately, enemas are given without a nurse and restricted health care plan, and staff allowed C2 to walk alone from bus stop unsafely. Confidential interviews revealed that S2 restrained C2 on two separate occasions. Documents reviewed revealed that C2 was restrained on four occasions. A review of the program statement indicated that the facility does not use restraints. For the allegation that staff is not recording medication distribution appropriately, it was reported that on 10/26/2022, S7 signed off on C1\u2019s medication administration records for medication times that had not yet been administered and the medications remained in the bubble pack. Confidential interviews and records reviewed revealed that S7 signed off on the medication before the administration time and the medication remained in the bubble pack. Regarding the allegation that C2 was given an enema without a nurse and restricted health care plan, confidential interviews revealed that C2 was given an enema on several occasions by staff members. A review of the facility program statement indicated that the facility was not approved for specialty health care services which is needed to provide restricted health care. Lastly, for the allegation that staff allowed C2 to walk alone from the bus stop in an unsafe manner, confidential interviews revealed that when S1 picked up C2 from the bus stop and they were in the vehicle, C2 tried to hit S1. S1 told C2 to walk back to the facility and they drove the vehicle alongside C2 while C2 walked to the facility. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that staff are conducting restraints which are not in their program statement, staff are not recording medication distribution appropriately, enemas are given without a nurse and restricted health care plan, and staff allowed C2 to walk alone from bus stop unsafely are Substantiated.

A confidential interview indicated that C1 may have reported C2\u2019s inappropriate behaviors after C2 turned 18 years old to get C2 removed from the home due to other conflict between the two clients. Confidential interviews yielded conflicting information regarding how often staff were checking on clients while in their bedrooms, even after the alleged incidents between C1 and C2 were reported; however, it was reported that staff were always present at the facility, available for clients if they needed help, and redirected clients who were engaging inappropriately with their peers. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that there were no known sexualized behaviors for staff to be watchful of C2 prior to the above incidents being reported. A confidential interview indicated that C1 would close the bedroom door for privacy making it difficult for staff to maintain supervision of C1 and C2 prior to C2\u2019s discharge. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that lack of supervision resulted in a minor engaging in inappropriate activity is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted with Monica McDade, Administrator and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided.",

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the facility concerns in regards to the use of Law Enforcement, code of compliance in the community and impact of the school district from the Santa Barbara/ Carpinteria. The following individuals were present: CCLD: Olivia Rosas, Kellee Coleman, JoAunne Griffin, Kevin Sauk Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara PD: Lt Ugo Peter Arnold, Carpinteria City Manager: Ron Alonzo, Dave Durflinger 4 Kids 2 Kids: Kris Hart, Gabriel C, Kelly Keddedy, CBHS: Kim Suderman, County Representative: Laurie Haro, Santa Barbara County's Behavior Wellness Department and STRTP liason Anthony Hollenback Department of Education: Elizabeth Adams, Luz Sanchez De Diaz Other: Rose Zamora Comments: Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara PD: Previous meeting was condoned on 11/19/20 with Carpinteria School District Superintendent, Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara PD, Carpinteria City Manager. On 07/27/21, with Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara PD, Carpinteria City Manager. The use of LE has decreased. Since the last meeting the facility has only made two calls for LE. One on 08/17/21, 09/16/21. 4 Kids 2 Kids: Intake Process is conducted via Zoom, are conducting in NSP right away, staff is provided with training before they begin to work, Only one therapist, Report continues on LIC-809C\n\nSchool District concerns: To bring clients who fit the school resources. The school District small and cannot provide all the resources for some clients with Individualized Education Program (IEP). They are driving clients to next District over to be able to provide the 1:1. To better serve clients who have IEP to be place in a community who has the resources available. Since facility has been open only two clients have received out of County services. Facility has no reject policy. Facility to be able to meet clients need they should find out in the intake if the client as IEP because if they do their program wont be a right fit. Having to drive a client 1 hour away to be able to obtain services is not ideal. Department of Education: The facility has improved on the youth being received and getting the resources needed. The point of contact is Administrator or Facility Manager. Community Care Licensing (CCL): The facility has made improvements towards clients being placed. Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara can continue the conversation with 4 Kids 2 Kids individually and invite CCLD if needed. Recommendations: Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara PD is invited to visit the facility to make positive connection with the clients. Administrator would be the point of contact for Carpinteria/ Santa Barbara PD. Exit interview completed and a copy of the report was email to the Administrator for signature.",

Further, based on observation by LPA, bedroom doors do not have the ability to be locked, and only the bathroom accessible to residents can be locked from within. Additionally, interviews conducted regarding staff hitting a resident revealed that during an escalated incident, the alledged victim was physically redirected in accordance with approved restraint/redirection techniques.

On 8/2/22, the department received a complaint alledging that a minor engaged in inappropriate contact with another minor. During the investigative process, LPA O\u2019Connell conducted confidential interviews with all relevant parties and collected information on the above allegation. After reviewing all the statements and the information obtained, the above allegation is supported, as the confidential interviews confirmed that C2 has demonstrated a history of inappropriate behaviors that necessitate the provision of additional supervision to ensure the safety of C2 and other residents in care. Further record reviews show that the placing agency authorized the provision of one to one supervision for C2 on 6/6/22, and was backdated to 5/23/22 due to the licensee confirming that one to one services had already begun in order to \u201censure the safety of the client and assist with her stabilization.\u201d Further confidential interviews, and record reviews revealed that C2 has not been assigned a one to one staff on a consistent basis, and in alignment with the authorization from the placing agency, thereby leading to opportunities for the minor to engage in aggressive and inappropriate behaviors with other residents. Based on LPAs observations, record reviews and interviews which were conducted, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

During the investigative process, LPA O\u2019Connell conducted confidential interviews with all relevant parties and collected information on the above allegations. After reviewing all the statements and the information obtained, the above allegation is supported, as the confidential interviews confirmed that primary residential counselors, responsible for the direct care of clients, are not afforded with necessary training to manage symptoms/behaviors presented by target population that the program serves. Further confidential interviews revealed that staff have not been provided with comprehensive and completed ProAct training, which is used for the purpose of de-escalation, redirection, and conceptualization of trauma based behaviors. This training and training of a similar nature provide staff with the tools to administer trauma-informed care, and support client/staff safety.

The purpose of this meeting was for Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD) to address operational issues for both facilities as well as matters related to qualifications of current/former staff. individuals in attendance: Marylou Escoto- Facility Administrator (FA), for 4kids2kids-Safe House (STRTP) and Living Arrows (THPP) Yazmine Sepulveda- Facility Manager (FM), for 4kids2kids-Safe House (STRTP) Christina Mengrahani- Head of Services (HOS), for 4kids2kids- Safe House (STRTP) Alaina Upthegrove- Bookeeper for Living Arrows (THPP) and (pending approval by CCLD) assigned \"designee\" for THPP Topics of discussion: a. Access to facility records - applicable regulation was reviewed and discussed due to recent inspections involving a delay/inability in accessing facility records by CCLD staff . LPM Sauk discussed the related requirement (Section 80044 Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency:) to allow CCLD staff to have access to all facility records, including medication logs during unannounced inspections. b. Fingerprint clearance of staff prior to working at facility- LPM Sauk informed FA of the requirement to ensure that staff are reflected as fingerprint cleared in Guardian, prior to working at the facility. LPM Sauk inquired about who has the authority to to grant new staff permission to work on the facility premises after verifying clearance. FA communicated that she is responsible for verifying all new staff are fingerprint cleared prior to anyone working within the facilities. LPM Sauk noted that FA is reflected as a \"corporate board member\" in Guardian and this inaccuracy would need to be corrected- FA agreed to update Guardian record. Continued on LIC809C\n\nLPM Sauk addressed the inaccuracies in staff still showing as associated to the facilities in Guardian, but are being reported as \"former\" employees. LPM Sauk instructed FA that staff who are no longer employed by the organization, will need to be dis-associated from the Guardian rosters. c. Maintenance of required documentation- LPM Sauk addressed the substantial delays in providing the LIC500 to Licensing staff during inspection and informed the FA that the LIC500 (Personnel Report) shall be provided to CCL upon request. LPM further communicated that If the facilities choose not to use an LIC500 form, they may use a form of their own, which shall include all of the same information on the LIC500 at a minimum. Further, the LIC500 provided to CCL should be current and have the date of the LPA\u2019s visit. LPM Sauk referenced the related regulatory requirements: Section 80066(e),Section 80066 (c), Section 80066 (f). d. Communication issues between the facilities and CCLD- due to ongoing communication issues in contacting the FA as well as and barriers in obtaining information for both facilities, LPM Sauk inquired about the point of contact for both facilities. FA confirms that she is the administrator for both the STRTP and THPP, but is supported by the FM (assigned to the STRTP) along with a newly assigned designee (assigned to support the THPP). FA explained that both the bookkeeper and FM can be contacted in the event of FA's absence. LPM Sauk gathered details about the newly assigned designee's/bookkeeper\u2019s role in the facility, her qualifications, and scope of duties. A review of the bookkeeper\u2019s qualifications will be conducted prior to granting approval as the new designee for the facility. LPA O'Connell communicated the need to engage in transparent communication and requested that all communication between the organization and CCLD include the FA. LPA O'Connell communicated instance where incidents have occurred and the FA communicated that she did not have awareness or was informed of the situation. FA agreed to communicate request to entire staff/board member group. e. Required staff and their qualifications- LPM Sauk inquired about who the identified Social Work Supervisors and Social Worker personnel are for the THPP. FA identifies that there is one Supervising Social Worker who reviews documentation. LPM Sauk requested additional information on the Social Work Supervisor to ensure qualifications. FA agreed. LPM Sauk referenced the following related regulatory requirement: Sections 86065.4 (Social Work Supervisor/Social Worker Ratio), 86065.2 (Social Worker Supervisor), 86065.3 (Social Work Personnel). Continued on LIC809C\n\nf. Physical Plant of THPP facility- LPM Sauk informed FA that in 2022, the administrative assistant for the THPP reported that the second back-room office at the Living Arrows office would no longer be used as part of the facility, but CCLD recently found out that the office is still available for use. LPM Sauk inquired about the use of the space, as well as the function. FA reports that she did not have awareness of any plans to relinquish use of the space and the second adjoining office at the THPP remains part of the facility property. FA reports that the space is used to conduct meetings amongst staff and meet with clients as needed. g. Recent Deficiencies- due to the recent inspections of the STRTP facility, concerns regarding food storage and the physical plant cleanliness were addressed. LPM Sauk communicated awareness that the facility utilizes food pantry donations to supplement grocery store purchases for clients and communicated that food must be inspected regularly to ensure it is safe for consumption and not expired. LPM Sauk also communicated the need to maintain the facilities in a cleanly condition at all times, per regulatory requirements. FA acknowledged and agreed to address issue immediately. LPM Sauk concluded the meeting and communicated that a copy of this report would be provided to the FA for review and signature.",

During this inspection, 5 out of 12 Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 12 Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 4 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, 11/15/23). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and services, CalAim, and Safety plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Canal observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Marylou Escoto.",

LPA Martin met with Dallas Ledet, Facility Manager to deliver investigative findings concerning Incident Report submitted to Community Care Licensing (CCL) on 9/6/2024. The incident reported in part that a staff member contributed marijuana and paraphernalia to minors in care. The incident was referred to CCL Investigations Branch. CCL Investigator, Laura Garcia conducted the investigation including confidential interviews with five youth, three staff members and contacts with Facility Administrator. In addition, facility file history, related documentary evidence and incident reports were reviewed. The investigation revealed confidential statements identifying Staff member (S1) as providing vaping paraphernalia which contained marijuana and nicotine in addition to observing S1 smoking during their shift hours and while conducting outings. Corroborating statements revealed S1 made it accessible for the Youth to engage in smoking marijuana while at the facility. A review of confirmed text message sent from S1 cellular phone to a youth resident in which S1 is allowing the youth to utilize S1\u2019s \u201cpen\u201d. The \u201cpen\u201d refers to a vape containing marijuana. In the text message, S1 is instructing the Youth not to get caught with the \u201cpen\u201d, implying that the youth having possession of S1\u2019s \u201cpen\u201d is too risky. The investigation further revealed from confidential statements that S1 presented erratic driving behaviors while possibly being under the influence of marijuana based on odor emitting from S1\u2019s person. Records reviewed revealed S1 was discharged on 8/23/2024 for violating company rules/policies. (Continued on page LIC809-C)\n\nBased on the statements gathered, and records reviewed the Department has determined there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove inimical conduct by S1, posing an immediate health, safety, and personal rights risk to youth in care.

It was also reported that the STRTP is \u201cviolent\u201d. Additional details state C1 has been told \"I'm gonna beat your ass\" by other clients in the STRTP and C1 is scared and does not feel safe in the STRTP. The allegation further clarifies that only verbal threats are occurring, no one has physically hurt C1 at the STRTP. One witness maintains this is occurring at the STRTP and confirms there is no physical bullying occurring, primarily verbal harassment and verbal abuse by clients in the STRTP. Most witnesses corroborate that C1 is not being bullied and C1 is not being verbally harassed. Several confidential statements corroborate that C1 makes up lies about the STRTP and other clients in the home. Additionally, these confidential statements all corroborate that C1 is an attention seeker and is often the instigator of any verbal altercations that occur between clients in the home, causing staff to have to redirect both C1 and other involved parties. Several witnesses deny ever bullying or witnessing C1 be bullied at the STRTP. Confidential witnesses also deny verbally harassing C1. Staff state C1 never reported to staff that C1 is being bullied, or verbally harassed or that C1 does not feel safe at the facility. While staff confirm several incidents of verbal arguments have occurred between C1 and other clients in the home, most witnesses deny this being labeled as bulling or verbal harassment. In addition, several witnesses have heard C1 state, \"I'm going to get these houses shut down\" about the STRTPs. Based on interviews conducted, the allegations that C1 is being bullied while in care and C1 was verbally harassed while in care may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited.

S1 states S1 tried to stand between C1 and C2 to separate them and redirect C1 and C2, but C2 got past S1.

    "narrative": "On June 25, 2021, at 9:05 AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carmen Escobar arrived at Achieve Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP). The purpose of the inspection was to complete the continuation inspection for STRTP annual inspection that was initiated on June 24, 2021. LPA already completed the physical inspection of the facility and reviewed facility client files on the first day of the annual inspection. During this annual inspection continuation, LPA Escobar reviewed eleven personnel files to ensure they contained all required documentation per Title 22 Regulations and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS). Personnel Files are usually maintained in a locked closet by the front door. All appropriate personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. Nine of the eleven files that were reviewed were for employees who converted from group home personnel to STRTP personnel. LPA observed the converted staff members were trained according to the STRTP training requirements. Files for staff 1 (S1), staff 2 (S2), staff 3 (S3), staff 7 (S7), staff 8 (S8), and staff 10 (S10) did not have current job evaluations. Staff 4 (S4), staff 5 (S5), staff 6 (S6) and staff 11 (S11) did not have employer verification form in files. S6 is fingerprinted and cleared per Guardian background check system, however, S6 is associated to sister facility, Home of Excellence, not Achieve STRTP. Facility will be cited under Title 22 section 80019: Criminal Record Clearance. S5, S6, and S10, did not have proof of current CPR/first aid in files, facility will be cited under Title 22 section 80075: Health Related Services. S8 did not have proof of TB test in file. Technical advisories will be issued for the aforementioned file issues. Administrator Tiffany Merritt is present at the facility a minimum of 20 hours a week, as verified by staff schedule and interviews. Appropriate staff/client ratios were verified during this inspection. LPA discussed the following with the Administrator and Facility Manager: incident reporting, including incidents related to Assembly Bill 388 law enforcement contacts as well as incidents involving emergency interventions. LPA discussed procedures for Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings, including an overview of required Core\n\nServices and Supports. Two youth counselors (direct care staff), one Facility Manager, and facility Administrator, present during annual inspection were interviewed in regard to their job duties, training, and services provided at the facility. All staff were able to provide sufficient information in relation to the facility's STRTP program. Staff have no issues or concerns regarding the facility. Based upon the inspection of facility records and interviews with staff and clients, the Licensee appears to be meeting CFT and Core Services/Supports requirements. LPA requested the recent board meeting minutes be provided via email by June 30, 2021. Additionally, it should be noted that during the physical inspection of the facility on 06/24/21, it was observed that the licensee has cameras in common areas of the facility. There is an exception on file for the facility to use the cameras and the facility continues to meet the terms and conditions of the exception. A copy of this report, the advisory notices, and appeal rights, were provided to Facility Administrator, Tiffany Merritt.",

The perpetrator picked up C1 around the corner from the facility. They got drunk and smoked \"weed\". The perpetrator got on top of C1 and had nonconsexual sex with C1. C1 met the perpetrator online and this was the first time they met in person. It was reported C1 would be absent from care every night from March 2021 to May 2021, because C1 did not want to be at the facility and wanted to experience the teenage life of drinking and doing weed. C1 would walk out the facility front door and the staff would not say or do anything in effort to prevent C1 from leaving. The staff would just sit there and not say a word. The staff did not shadow C1 either. This was the pattern when C1 went absent from care and this occurred when the incident happened. There would be two staff working when there were six clients in placement. There were only two staff that would try to talk the clients out of going absent from care. The other clients who would go absent from care were all discharged from the facility before C1 was discharged. The LPA received further information that C1 and C1's roommate would meet guys online and then go absent from care. C1's roommate and the other clients would go out their bedroom windows to leave but the facility had installed alarms on the windows. The alarms would alert the staff when a window was opened, and the staff would check and discover the client(s) had left. The clients then started walking out the front door when going absent from care. Achieve Residential Center is a no contact facility, the staff are prohibited from putting their hands on a client to prevent the client from leaving. C1 would go absent from care multiple times a week by walking out the front door. The LPA received consistent information the staff would shadow C1. The staff would complete a perimeter check and call law enforcement to report the runaway. It was further reported, there were two staff working when the clients were present during awake hours and one staff during the overnight shift. The facility has a capacity of six. One staff was able to talk C1 out of leaving but when the next shift arrived, C1 left. Once C1\u2019s roommate was discharged from the facility, C1 stopped going absent from care. However, other information was received the staff would not say or do anything in effort to prevent C1 from going absent from care. Allegation #2) During the course of confidential interviews, it was disclosed to the LPA this incident was the second time C1 was sexually assaulted while being absent from care from the facility. The first sexual assault was on 03/09/21. C1 reported the first assault to the staff who in turn reported it to law enforcement and the child abuse hotline. *** Continued on next page ***\n\nHowever, C1 did not report the second assault because staff #1 (S1) and staff #2 (S2) told C1, \u201cYou are wearing the same jacket that has cum on it,\u201d in reference to the first sexual assault. They also told C1 it was C1\u2019s fault because C1 was absent from care when the 03/09/21 incident occurred. There were no witnesses to the staff\u2019s statements. When the LPA conducted additional interviews, S1 and S2 adamantly denied making the statements. Two of the other staff denied having any knowledge of the allegation. It was reported to the LPA that C1 disclosed to a staff that S2 blamed C1 for the 03/09/21 assault. Other information was received that S1 and S2 blamed C1 for the 03/09/21 assault. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations C1 was sexually assaulted between March and May of 2021 due to a lack of supervision and C1 was blamed by S1 and S2 for getting sexually assaulted may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to Janet Winkfield.",

During the course of the investigation, the LPA conducted confidential interviews with one client (C1) and five staff. On 12/08/21, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging C1 was sexually assaulted between March and May of 2021. It was reported C1 met a man (approximately 20 years of age) on Plenty of Fish (online dating website). C1 stated that they were in the man's car, he got on top of her and had sex with C1. C1 reportedly felt \"numb and lifeless\" because C1 had smoked marijuana with the man prior to the sexual assault. C1 did not disclose the assault because C1 was afraid the staff would tell C1 it was C1\u2019s fault. There was a prior case of sexual assault to C1 that occurred while placed at the facility and the staff told C1 that the prior case was C1\u2019s fault. *** Continued on next page ***",

Confidential interviews further stated that staff continuously redirect clients, offer therapeutic services for clients, provide activities for clients, and take clients on outings while in care. Other confidential interviews stated that clients leave the facility when clients are bored due to lack of activities offered by the program, and that some clients leave the facility to earn money.

    "narrative": "(**Continued from LIC 9099 pg. 1**) On October 22, 2022, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging that a knife is accessible to minors in care, minors engaged in an altercation, staff did not safeguard minor's allowance, and that minor is intimidating another minor in care. It was specifically reported to CCL that C1 and C2 engaged in a physical altercation resulting in C2 threatening C1 with a knife. It was also reported that C2 was intimating other clients and taking clients allowances while in care. During investigation, confidential interviews stated that there was an altercation between C1 and C2 that resulted in staff separating clients and removing C1 temporarily to another sister facility. Confidential interviews denied that the altercation was a result of lack of supervision by staff and added that both C1 and C2 were friends prior to the altercation. Confidential interviews also stated that staff learned that C2 had threatened C1 with a knife after the altercation had occurred and staff reported the information that resulted in law enforcement involvement. Confidential interviews denied that a knife was accessible to C2 in care and added that staff did not know where C2 obtained the knife from due to C2 absconding from the facility often; while another confidential interview stated that C2 obtained a knife from another client in care and added that the knife was taken from the facility\u2019s kitchen. C1 nor C1\u2019s CSW could not be reached for comment. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the above stated allegations. Regarding the allegation that staff did not safeguard client\u2019s allowances, and that C2 was intimating C1 in care, confidential interviews stated staff distribute allowances weekly according to the program\u2019s allowance policy and that clients sign a document acknowledging receipt of allowance. Confidential interviews further stated that staff learned about the allowance incidences after they occurred and added that staff were informed that C2 was intimating clients and taking clients allowances while in care. Another confidential interview denied that C2 was using intimidation to take allowances away and maintained that C2 was not \u201cbullying C1 in care\u201d. C1, nor C1\u2019s CSW could not be reached for comment. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the above stated allegations. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegation that knife is accessible to minors in care, C1 and C2 engaged in an altercation, staff did not safeguard C1\u2019s allowance, and that C2 is intimidating C1 in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

    "narrative": "Other confidential interviews reported that the school was too far; however, the distance was not a factor in determining where C1 would attend school. Confidential interviews reported that C1 has special educational needs and, due to those needs, C1 can only attend certain schools. Furthermore, it was reported that the school must meet C1\u2019S needs and offer the right programs. A confidential interview reported that school enrollment could take longer when special education needs are involved, as the school district must determine the appropriate school placement. Confidential interviews reported that C1 expressed concerns about attending the new school and refused to go. Confidential documentation obtained as part of the investigation corroborate C1\u2019s refusal to attend school and shows that efforts were made to return C1 to their school of choice, but C1 refused to cooperate. Confidential interviews and documentation show that facility staff worked with the school district to enroll C1 in independent studies until a more suitable school could be found. The Department also received an allegation that the facility is not meeting youth's (C1\u2019s) personal care and grooming needs. Confidential interviews reported that C1 did not have access to culturally appropriate hair care products, and facility staff did not allow C1 to get their (C1\u2019s) hair braided. Confidential interviews reported that facility staff provides all clients with adequate hygiene and grooming products. LPA observed additional hygiene and grooming products in the staff office, available to clients upon request. Other confidential interviews reported that staff ensures that all hair care, hygiene, and grooming products respect the client\u2019s culture, identity, and gender expression. Personal interviews also reported that hair braiding services were not withheld from C1 as a form of punishment. Confidential interviews revealed that all clients must request hair care services, and C1 did not submit a formal request. Personal interviews and documentation also report that hair braiding services were arranged for C1, but C1 would leave the facility without permission; therefore, C1\u2019s hair braiding appointment could not be scheduled. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and document review, the allegations that the facility is not meeting the youth's (C1's) educational needs and the facility is not meeting the youth's (C1's) personal care and grooming needs, may have occurred, however, is not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "On July 6, 2023, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging that due to lack of supervision youth sustained injuries while in care. It was reported to CCL that C1 sustained multiple injuries due to an altercation with other clients in placement. During investigation, there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegation that lack of supervision by staff was a result of C1 sustaining injuries while in care. Although it was revealed that an altercation involving C1 and C2 resulted from C1 taking C2\u2019s property the department received inconsistencies with statements provided during confidential interviews. Some confidential interviews denied that C1 was \u201cjumped\u201d by multiple clients in care and added that there were no visible injuries observed on C1 after the altercation involving C2. While other confidential interviews reported that staff were aware that C2 was going to fight C1 upon C1\u2019s return to the facility due to C1 taking C2\u2019s property. Confidential interviews further reported that staff did not intervene on a timely manner during the altercation rather than allowed the clients to fight each other prior to intervening. Other confidential interviews denied that staff allowed the altercation and maintained that C1 had no injuries that required medical attention. Confidential interviews further reported that C1 was absconding from the facility daily and was in placement for a short time. Confidential interviews further maintained that the altercation only involved C1 and C2 and injuries were not observed on C1 due to C1 leaving the facility after the incident. C2 could not be reached for comment regarding the allegation where C2 was identified as the alleged aggressor. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that due to lack of supervision C1 sustained injuries while in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights will be emailed to Facility Manager, Janet Winkfield due to technical difficulties.",

    "narrative": "A confidential interview reported that the facility did receive a call from the school, and school personnel informed S1 of the emergency involving C1. A confidential interview reported the school was supposed to call back with an update on C1. However, when the school failed to do so, S1 called the school and was informed that C1 was being transported to the hospital accompanied by school staff. A confidential interview reported that S1 was the only staff working; therefore, S1 could not leave the STRTP, as other clients were on facility grounds. Confidential interviews reported that S2 was called into work and immediately went to the hospital to meet C1 and school staff. In addition, confidential interviews reported that S2 remained with C1 until C1 was discharged and transported C1 back to the facility. The Department also received an allegation that staff are not addressing youth\u2019s (C1) self-harming behaviors. It was reported that C1 admitted to self-harming and had visible marks on both arms. Confidential interviews reported that staff are responsive, provide emergency interventions, and utilize C1\u2019s safety plan. Confidential interviews reported that C1 does not always respond to staff interventions and will refuse mental health services. Documentation obtained as part of the investigation reports that C1\u2019s authorized representative was made aware of C1\u2019s behaviors, and a meeting was held to address the issue. Confidential interviews reported staff do not ignore C1\u2019s self harming behaviors and increased supervision of C1. In addition, to ensure the safety of all clients in care, during the inspection, LPA observed that all knives, scissors, and sharp objects were locked in a lockbox, locked in the hall closet, and inaccessible to clients Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegations that staff did not respond in a timely manner to emergency calls regarding youth (C1) and staff are not addressing youth\u2019s (C1) self-harming behaviors are unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted.

Confidential interviews also reported staff have increased supervision of C1 and provided C1 with additional services and resources.

The staff said they will always wait for C1 to give them the vape and C1 always ignore them. During interviews with staff, they said that they always search the facility inside and out, for any type of contraband and found bottles of alcohol and confiscated them immediately. The staff even has a chair in the hallway to make sure clients are okay at night and check every 15 minutes that they are in their room. Furthermore, the SW stated that they never observed C1 smoking marijuana but, the times SW visited C1 in the facility, there was a smell of marijuana in C1's room and in C1. SW stated that the facility did a great job with everything that was happening with C1. SW does not know what else the facility could have done for C1.

Clients are not allowed to dye or cut their hair without parent or the courts permission. At or around 11PM, C1 was in the bathroom bleaching her hair with product that was stolen from a local store. Bedtime at the facility is 10PM. NOC staff knocked on the door several times and repeatedly asked C1 to answer the door. C1 ignored it and NOC forcefully opened the door. There were contradicting stories as to whether C1 was naked. Based on interviews and review of supportive documentation, AGPA Woodard determined that the preponderance of evidence standard was not met and did not prove that the alleged personal rights and lack of supervision violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found unsubstantiated.

LPA Hernandez conducted the initial 10-day complaint inspection on February 10, 2022 and conducted confidential interviews with two clients. AGPA Woodard conducted subsequent visits to the facility on April 9, 2022 and May 1, 2022; confidential interviews were conducted with four staff members, and four clients. Additional phone interviews were conducted on April 23, April 25, April 27, and May 12, 2022. The investigation revealed that youth in the home have a history of not getting along, threatening one another and accusing each other of theft. A review of supportive documentation reveals that C2 has made threats and is verbally aggressive with other youths. There are incident reports for the two occasions of physical assault of C2. Youth in the home belongings were taken due to clients going into each other\u2019s room when clients are not home. C2 was reimbursed for her missing/destroyed items. Confidential interviews revealed that there was a lot of animosity and theft happening in the home. As a result, C2 was jumped. When issues occur, staff will redirect youths, use de-escalation techniques and intervene immediately. The facility provides lockers for client\u2019s use which are located in the garage; however most clients will not use them because of location and size of lockers. Client\u2019s did have access to fart spray, and it was used in pranks. Staff verified that the substance on minor\u2019s bed was not urine and was water which was minimal. Staff removed client\u2019s linen which was washed immediately. C2 was in possession of scissors and had them hidden behind her back based on observations of other clients in the home. In statements made by clients, staff were informed but didn\u2019t do anything about it. SIR dated February 5, 2022, C2 admitted to having the scissors because she was being verbally attacked by C1. Based on confidential interviews and review of supportive documentation, AGPA Woodard determined the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the personal rights allegations are found to be unsubstantiated.A copy of this report was left with facility representative.",

During the investigative process by Licensing program Analyst (LPA), Nancy O\u2019Connell, all relevant parties have been accounted for. Supporting evidence includes: review of LIC 500, staff roster, and interviews from clients and staff. Interviews reflect conflicting information related to witnessing staff entering a client bathroom. Statements obtained from staff and house residents reflect inconsistent reports of seeing a male staff enter a client bathroom without permission. Further, FM2 denies the allegation and a house resident provided a statement indicating that she was present during the alleged incident and did not witness staff enter the bathroom where client was showering. Lastly, the policy to ensure continuous supervision was obtained, and the program maintains a safety policy that directs staff to conduct room observations with notice in order to ensure client safety. Regarding the secondary allegation related to staff allowing clients to enter minor\u2019s room to assault minor, statements gathered reflect extensive efforts on behalf of staff members to prevent clients from entering bedroom to assault minor. Statements corroborate corroborate staff presence and attempts to block clients from entering C7\u2019s bedroom.

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, and Trauma informed safety plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Canal observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident.

Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. No deficiencies are being cited at this time. Exit Interview conducted, and a copy of this report was provided to the facility staff. .",

Based on the interviews and review of incident reports, it was determined that on two separate occasions, facility staff did not notify the social worker of C1 of injuries to C1 in a timely manner. In both instances the social worker had to learn of the injuiries via other sources.

    "narrative": "On Friday 6/25/21 at 10:11AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit to the facility to conduct a required annual inspection. A screening call was made prior to the visit. Safety precautions were taken, including face masks, hand sanitizer, disinfectants, and social distancing. Additionally, LPA tested negative for COVID-19 on Monday 6/21/21 and does not have any symptoms of COVID-19. LPA met with Facility Manager Patricia \"Pat\" McCorkell and informed of the purpose of the visit. At 10:20AM, LPA inspected the facility site and grounds. The facility is organized and free of debris. LPA observed that the facility is clean and commonly used surfaces are clean. However, LPA advised that the facility could wipe down cabinet doors, doorways, and bedroom walls in unused rooms in preparation for new placements. The grounds are free of obstructions and are well-maintained. LPA observed that the recycling was stored in a trash bag in the backyard. LPA suggested that recycling be kept in a bin or a recyclable bag in a bin. Hot water and room temperature measured within permitted ranges at 112.0 F and 74 F, respectively. The kitchen is stocked with food to meet the needs of the residents in care and meets the mandated 7-day non-perishable and 2-day perishable standard. Food items are in date and are labeled by date of purchase. Cleaners and sharps are kept in locked storage areas downstairs, and the laundry room cleaners are locked. LPA observed a shower cleaner under the sink of the downstairs bathroom that is locked and used for staff. However, currently it is being used for residents while the upstairs bathroom is being updated. Pat immediately removed the cleaner. There is a sign-in and screening table set up by the front entrance. Youth personal rights, emergency plan, and facility sketch visibly posted. LPA advised that the license should be posted in a visible location so it is visible to visitors. It can also be posted in the office. LPA inspected staff and client files and observed the files to be mostly complete, but the following items were missing: 2020-2021 Training record for staff S1, S2, S3; Physician's Report for R2; LIC 601 for R1 (see LIC 811 Confidential Names). Pat was able to complete R1's LIC 601 at visit, and R2's file indicates the physical was done but the form needs to be taken back to the doctor to be filled out and signed.\n\nDuring visit, LPA was informed that the upstairs bathroom shower/tub was being updated. LPA was not informed of this alteration and advised the facility that the Licensing agency should be notified prior to any alteration to the facility site, especially when it restricts residents' access to parts of the facility. LPA requested copies of the most current LIC 610 and LIC 500 no later than Friday 7/2/21. LPA spoke to Administrator LaSondra Jones, who said she has finished her training and needs to send in her request for recertification. Once she has done so, she will let LPA know, and she will send the new certification to LPA. There are no citations. Three advisories are being issued, per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80087 and 80086 and Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87066.

Based on confidential interviews with staff, resident, and witnesses, resident R1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) was left unattended at the hospital and, during this stay, was administered medication without the hospital obtaining appropriate consent from authorized representatives. Staff statements contradict, but no staff witnessed staff S1, who was delegated to supervise R1, go to the hospital, following R1 in the ambulance. R1's authorized representative notified staff S3 that R1 was unattended at the hospital and that the hospital had no contact for the facility. S3 called the facility and spoke to S1 and informed S1 at that time that S1 needed to be at the hospital with R1. S3 went to hospital, supervised R1, and transported back to facility after discharge.

Based on report, the allegation pertains to staff having an inappropriate tone and attitude toward residents. Based on confidential interviews, staff have used a rough tone and inappropriate language when directing youth to get off of the phone and when redirecting youth. Multiple staff stated they heard staff using a rough tone that was not appropriate or not conducive to work in this type of facility and/or that they did not agree with being used in interactions with residents. Additionally, LPA observed multiple staff to have an unsupportive tone when discussing resident behaviors that was significant enough to make LPA concerned about that carrying over to interactions with residents. Staff expressed their frustrations and disbelief in residents' condition(s), at times in earshot of residents, which is inappropriate. Statements also indicate that residents feel staff pick favorites among the residents, evidenced by staff leaving out some residents in conversations or day to day activities, like calling residents down for meals.",

    "narrative": "On 1/18/24, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a case management visit at the facility to give notice of deficiencies found during the course of an investigation at the facility. LPA met with Facility Manager Patricia McCorkell and informed of the purpose of the visit. See LIC 811 Confidential Names for names of all referenced individuals. As a result of the investigation, LPA issued a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Version 5, Section 87072(c)(15), which states residents have the right \"to be accorded dignity in their personal relationships with staff and other persons.\" The facility was cited previously cited on 04/10/2023 when this same requirement was listed under 87072(c)(10) under ILS Version 4. Despite the revision in code number in ILS Version 5, the requirement is the same. Therefore, LPA is assessing a civil penalty of $250 for repeat violation within 12 months. See LIC 421FC dated 1/18/24. Additionally, LPA observed the following deficiencies. On 12/19/23, there were four residents in care and only one staff on shift. LPA verified that the minimum ratio for this facility is 1 staff to 3 residents, which was not followed. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87065.5(a)(1). On 12/19/23, LPA obtained copies of the needs and services plans in the residents' files. During LPA's review, LPA observed that R1's needs and services plans include the incorrect name for R1 and not the government nor preferred name for R1. Also, LPA observed that the plan developed shortly after a report of staff speaking inappropriately was made stated that R1 had a history of making false allegations despite no previous mention of this challenge in prior plans. SEE PAGE 2.\n\nPAGE 2 Further, based on confidential interviews and record review, evidence indicates that the resident was not consulted in the development of their plan for multiple months. The record for R1 was missing plans for May, June, July, and August 2023, and the plans that were in R1's file were missing either R1's or R1's authorized representative's signature or documentation of the signatures being pending. LPA is issuing citations of STRTP ILS Sections 87068.2(b), 87068.2(g), 87068.3(a), and 87068.3(b). During LPA's review of residents' clinical notes, LPA observed the complete record, as LPA requested, reflected that multiple weeks were missed, and confidential interviews reflect that weekly individual and group sessions, as indicated in the plan of operation and activity calendars posted in the facility, are not being conducted. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87022(f). Additionally, based on confidential interviews and record review, the facility's monthly activity calendar posted in the facility is not being followed, and regular outings and therapeutic activities are not being provided. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87079(a). On 12/19/23, LPA obtained copies of resident records and upon review observed that R1, R2, R3 and R4's LIC 613B Personal Rights forms were outdated and thus missing newer personal rights and were not signed by the authorized representatives. LPA reviewed resident files during today's visit and observed this deficiency to still exist. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87072(b)(2)(B). On 12/19/23, LPA obtained copies of resident records and upon review observed that R3 and R4's LIC 602 Physician's Reports (medical assessment) were blank. Both residents were placed over 90 days prior to LPA's visit date, and the assessment is to be completed within 30 days. LPA reviewed resident files during today's visit and observed this deficiency to still exist for R3. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 80069(a). SEE PAGE 3.\n\nPAGE 3 On 12/19/23, LPA obtained a copy of of the facility license, which was prominently displayed on the bulletin board hanging in the main floor hallway. The license was the provisional license, which expired 6/15/22. LPA verified in internal records that the facility was issued their current, valid license on 6/6/22. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87009(a). On 12/19/23, LPA obtained a copy of the LIC 500, which was prominently displayed on the bulletin board hanging in the main floor hallway. It was dated 08/10/2022 and did not include two staff currently working. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87066(b)(3). On 1/18/24, LPA requested to see personnel records for S8, which were completed as part of a corrective action plan for the staff member. LPA was informed that the records were not on site and could not be brought to the facility due to the administrator being unavailable on this day. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 80066(e). Lastly, LPA's review of submitted time sheets reflects that the administrator was on site less than 20 hours a week during the period of November 2023 to December 2023, as the timesheets reflect 17 hours worked the week of 11/20/23, 18 hours worked the week of 11/27/23, 8 hours worked the week of 12/25/23, and no records of hours worked were submitted for the weeks of 12/11/23 and 12/18/23. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87064(b)(1). Please see the attached LIC 809-D pages for citation details and the details and due dates for each plan of correction. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights were provided, and a copy of this report was left with Facility Manager Patricia McCorkell, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Facility Manager Marvette Simmons and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation and/or inspection of the facility, an area in which technical support may be beneficial was identified. It was learned that the facility has not documented life skills training in utilizing public transportation provided to resident(s) resulting in limited documentation to support that this training was provided. LPA read through the facility\u2019s plan of operation / program statement section discussing the facility\u2019s plan to provide this training with Facility Manager Marvette Simmons. The plan of operation / program statement also indicates that a daily transportation schedule ensuring youth-specific transportation needs are met is posted in the facility. LPA provided technical support in the form of an advisory to document life skills training and/or summarize residents\u2019 transportation plan in the needs and services plan. See LIC 9102 Technical Assistance. During the discussion, Facility Manager Marvette Simmons indicated that a transportation schedule is not currently posted. LPA advised that the schedule be posted or that this line in the plan of operation / program statement be revised, as it is not currently a specific requirement for this facility type to post a daily transportation schedule.

C1 also had an appointment with a therapist on 03/02/20. C1 was placed at the GH on 02/05/20. Information was received that C1 would self-harm and cut every day prior to being placed at the GH. When the complaint was received by CCL, C1 had two cutting incidents since 02/05/20. The LPA received corroborating information from all parties that C1 was attending therapy a minimum of two times a week and group therapy once a week. C1 would frequently receive additional therapy on an as needed basis whenever C1 had a crisis or reached out to the therapist. The therapy was provided by the GH therapist. C1 was also referred for Therapeutic Behavioral Services (TBS). C1 was approved for TBS approximately one and a half months before C1 was discharged from the GH. A safety plan was created for C1 in regards to the cutting. C1 made a lot of improvement. There were no cutting incidents from the end of March 2020 through May 2020. C1 was discharged from the GH on 06/02/20. The LPA received conflicting information as to who was responsible for submitting the TBS referral. Initially, the LPA was informed the formal referral had to come from the CSW since C1 was a Riverside County placement. The GH emailed the CSW the request for TBS services. The LPA was also informed the TBS referral process for Riverside County takes longer because the CSW has to initiate the referral. It was reported to the LPA it was the CSW\u2019s responsibility. However, other information was received that it was the GH\u2019s responsibility. The LPA received subsequent information the TBS referral has to be submitted by a Riverside County mental health nurse since the GH does not have a mental health contract with Riverside County. The Riverside County clients are each assigned a mental health nurse. In this case, the TBS referral packet was sent to the nurse who submitted the referral. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation the GH does not meet C1's needs may have occurred, however are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were emailed to Ms. Zavala for signature.

My suggestion is to remove this because it does not make sense and it is not clear how you would be able to determine whether or not a youth would need restraints. Section G. Admission Agreement 1) Page 140- add the word \u201cday\u201d after 14 in first sentence of the second paragraph. 2) Page 140 ensure that this is addressed. Youth reaches age 18 - Please ensure that there\u2019s a plan in place prior to removal Please ensure that the electronic copy and the hard copy are have the pages numbered the same. 3) Facility has a zero-tolerance policy regarding bullying/discrimination of youth/NMD based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. AGC should detail the trainings or methods it will utilize to prevent or address when discrimination occurs. ILS \u00a7 87072(d)(11) Sections H. Removal or transfer Policies and procedures 1) No mention of the staff responsible for Intake & intake process. 2) Page 159 Please remove this or make changes on how you will follow the required steps to preserve placements prior to removal. A majority of the reasons listed for emergency removal are reasons that would require an emergency CFT. Why would the facility not be able to request or advocate for a CFT in the event a youth did not want to participate in services? This would not be grounds for a 14-day notice and per the ILS it would be a violation to 14-day a notice a youth for this without following the requirements of the ILS. Anytime a preservation CFT can be done, it must be done. ILS \u00a7 87022(c)(12)(C) and 87068.4(c) (continued on next page...)\n\nSection J. Handling Money, Personal Property, & Valuables Please revise and remove this information. 1) There is an internal contradiction in the listed \u201cdefault\u201d allowances. On page 168 it says: Children ages 06 \u2013 08 years of age will receive $5.00 per week Children ages 09 \u2013 11 years of age will receive $8.00 per week Children ages 12 \u2013 13 years of age will receive $12.00 per week Children ages 14 \u2013 17 years of age will receive $17.00 per week But on page 169 it says this: Children ages 06 \u2013 08 years of age will receive $4.00 per week Children ages 09 \u2013 11 years of age will receive $5.00 per week Children ages 12 \u2013 13 years of age will receive $7.00 per week Children ages 14 \u2013 17 years of age will receive $12.00 per week 2) The overall policy violates the prohibition on fines. The Plan of Operation says: Policy and procedures ensure that a child\u2019s cash resources are not taken in the form of fines or punishment AGC will ensure that a client\u2019s cash resources are not taken in the form of fines or punishments, unless the following requirements are met: All fines levied will be recorded and explained in the child's file, including the amount of the fine and the reason for the fine. Such fines will be maintained in an account separate from the personal or business accounts of the licensee or facility. Records will be maintained accounting for any interest earned and expenditures from the account. All fines collected will be used for the benefit of the individual child or all children in placement. The circumstances under which fines are to be imposed will be specified in writing. Allowances will not be less than what is stipulated on the County contract. However, any extra incentivized allowance may be withheld, until the next allowance issuance. Any other monies earned, acquired or accrued may be used to fund / incentivize volunteers. This is the same format for reimbursement of damaged, destroyed, broken or stolen items. This incentive may not be taken from the County contracted allowance. However, any other monies earned, acquired or accrued may be used to fund / incentivize volunteers. This is the same format for reimbursement of damaged, destroyed, broken or stolen. (pages 170-171) (continued on next page...)\n\nMost of the language in the passage quoted above is from an outdated version of ILS. ILS 3.1 makes it clear that a child\u2019s cash resources cannot be taken in the form of fines, period. ILS \u00a7 87026(c). Program Statement Section 4. Core Services and Supports 1) Last sentence in section four needs to be on its own page not on the section five section cover sheet. (Page 82) Section 6. Development Review, Implementation and Modification of Needs and Services Plan 1) Page 97- typo at the top Terminated should be determined Section 15. House Rules for Children/Nonminor Dependents 1) Page 215 states \u201cStaff has the right to ask the client to unlock their electronics, cell phone or computers to check the context, if misuse is suspected. Refusal to give up the phone immediately will result in loss of phone privileges\u201d \u00b7 This is a violation of client\u2019s personal rights. There shouldn\u2019t be phone checks, unless there\u2019s a court order, it\u2019s discussed and agreed upon in a CFT, and included the client\u2019s needs and services plan. 2) Page 212 how will a client replace broken property? ILS \u00a7 87026(c)(1) and 87001(r)(1) Section 17. Positive Discipline Policies 1) Page 247 number the rest of the forms of discipline or remove 7, 8 and leave the bullets. Section 20. Mental Health Program Approval 1) Page 290 is blank it seems that information (bullets)is missing On this date, All of God\u2019s Children\u2019s is recommended for licensure on a provisional basis. License will expire one year from effective date. Facility will be licensed for a capacity of eight female clients, age 6 through 17. Facility accepts only ambulatory clients. Licensee prefers Wards and Dependents.",

    "narrative": "Allegation #1) S1 and T1 denied the allegation. S1 reported to the LPA that T1, is one of five therapists on the GH staff. None of them are going to risk their licenses and livelihood to do something like that. T1 has never told S1 anything about C1. T1 reported to the LPA S1 is not at the GH when T1 is working so T1 was confused as to where the allegation could have come from. C1 had not reported any concerns or the allegation to T1. During confidential interviews, the LPA did not receive any corroborating information regarding the allegation. However, other information was received stated that C1 stopped participating in therapy because C1 felt C1\u2019s information was shared with S1. Allegation #2) S1 denied the allegation. S1 reported to the LPA client #2 (C2) and C1 fought all of the time. C2 was 13 years old and very tall. C1 was 10 years old and small. The staff kept them apart. The staff would move C1 or C2 to the All of God\u2019s Children\u2019s boys\u2019 house during the day to keep them apart. S1 needed to make sure everyone was safe and did not get hurt. During confidential interviews, the LPA did not receive any corroborating information regarding the allegation. However, other information was received that S1 had a \u201cfamily meeting\u201d (group meeting) with the clients and did not let C1 attend. Allegation #3) S1 reported to the LPA the allegation is a lie. S1 stated she has been working in this field for too long to do something like that. S1 did not think C1 had been in any physical altercations since C2 was discharged from the GH on 06/17/20. Both clients were physical with each other. During confidential interviews, the LPA received conflicting information as to whether the allegation occurred. However, other information was received stated that S1 told C2 If C1 hurts you, then hit C1 back. Allegation #4) During confidential interviews, the LPA did not receive any corroborating information regarding the allegation. However, other information was received that C1 went to the hospital on 05/01/20 for injuries. The LPA conducted a records review and obtained a copy of the LIC 624-LE Law Enforcement Contact Report for 05/01/20. The report indicated the client was taken to the hospital, but it was not for injuries. There were no injuries noted on the report. However, other information was received stated C1 was taken to the hospital for injuries. *** Continued on next page ***\n\nBased on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations the GH therapist told A1 everything client #1 (C1) disclosed during their sessions, C1 was isolated by A1 as a form of punishment, A1 gave the other clients at the group home permission to hurt C1 and instructed them not to leave marks or bruises on C1 and C1 went to the hospital on 05/01/20 for injuries sustained at the GH may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were emailed to Mr. Jones for signature.

    "narrative": "Allegation #1) A1 confirmed the facility had bed bugs approximately 10 days prior to the safety inspection on 06/30/20. Two treatments were done six days apart. The whole house was treated except the kitchen and dining room. They bought new mattresses for each bed. During confidential interviews, the LPA received corroborating information the facility had bed bugs. In addition to new mattresses being purchased, it was reported new pillows were purchased, the linens, clients\u2019 clothing and the clients\u2019 stuffed animals were laundered. It was further reported to the LPA this was the first time the facility had bed bugs. The bed bugs were brought into the facility via a new client\u2019s belongings at placement. The LPA obtained a copy of the extermination receipt dated 06/18/20. The service was completed by Ameristar Termite & Pest Control. The service description stated, \u201cTreated inside for bed bugs.\u201d The LPA also obtained a copy of a Home Depot receipt, dated 06/25/20, showing the purchase of a Harris Bed Bug Kit. The licensee created a new policy in which the staff check the new client\u2019s belongings for bed bugs at placement. Although the facility had bed bugs, it was through no fault of the licensee and the licensee acted appropriately. Allegation #2) During the safety inspection, the LPA observed holes in the walls of bedrooms #1 and #3. The face of dresser drawer was broken off in bedroom #1. The doorknob was loose in bedroom #3 and interior components could be seen. The shower liner in the hallway bathroom had mildew on it. The light fixture in the hallway bathroom was operational. A1 reported the fixture was out for less than a day recently. The facility handyman had to replace the whole unit. The repair was completed the same day before it got dark. The LPA did not observe any feces on the toilet, doorknobs or fixtures as alleged. The bathrooms were clean. The kitchen was clean. The LPA asked A1 to take a white paper towel and wipe the kitchen counter. A1 complied and showed the LPA the towel. It was clean. During confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA the nocturnal staff clean the facility each night. During the other shifts, the staff clean commonly touched surfaces and keep a log of the cleanings. Allegation #3) During the safety inspection, the LPA did not observe any cleaning supplies or chemicals accessible to clients. During confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA that a new staff had left an aerosol can of Lysol disinfectant spray in the bathroom accessible to the clients. The LPA obtained a copy of the special incident report (SIR). On 04/25/20, client #1 (C1) went into the bathroom to take a shower and found the Lysol. C1 told the staff that C1 had ingested a little bit of disinfectant. The staff called poison control and gave C1 a glass of milk and water. The staff then took C1 to the emergency room. Two doctors analyzed C1 and took C1\u2019s vitals. It was believed that C1 only took a little of the Lysol, if any at all. C1 had no irritation to any internal or external body parts/organs and was not dealing with nausea, dizziness or any other side effects of what Lysol may cause.\n\nAllegation #4) The LPA received corroborating information, during confidential interviews, during the nocturnal shift (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) the staff to client ratio is 1:8. The only time a second staff works during the nocturnal shift is when a new staff is being trained. During the day and evening shifts, the staff to client ratio is 1:4. According the facility\u2019s approved program statement, the staff to client ratio from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. is 1:4. The LPA obtained a copy of the staff schedules for 06/01/20-06/15/20 and 06/16/20-06/30/20. There was only one staff scheduled Sundays-Thursdays from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. On Fridays and Saturdays there was only one staff scheduled from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. The facility was not operating per their approved program statement. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the allegations the facility has bed bugs, there\u2019s mildew inside of the shower curtain, cleaning chemicals such as Pine-Sol, Lysol and ammonia are left out in spray bottles accessible to the clients, and there will be one staff supervising seven or eight clients are substantiated. Facility is cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Sections 80087(a)(1) Buildings and Grounds, 80087(a) Buildings and Grounds, 80087(g) Buildings and Grounds and 80022(k) Plan of Operation. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were emailed to Mr. Jones for signature. Original signed reports will be placed in facility file.\n\nTwo readings were taken as the first reading seemed low, 97.9 degrees. The LPA had A1 run the hot water for another minute and the reading was 96.8 degrees. During confidential interviews, the LPA received conflicting information regarding the allegation. However, other information was received stated there was steam coming out of the bathroom faucets when the hot water was used. The LPA received a video showing steam coming out of the kitchen faucet when the hot water was used but not out of the bathroom faucets. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegation the facility's water is too hot for children may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were faxed to Mr. Jones for signature.

    "narrative": "Allegation #1) During confidential interviews, the LPA received corroborating information the facility had bed bugs at the end of November 2020. A pest control company was contacted and provided extermination service. The exterminator found some bed bug eggs and one dead bed bug. The exterminator did not find any live bed bugs. The LPA received a copy of the pest control invoice, dated 12/01/20, noting, \"Treatment inside for bed bugs and outside for ants and spiders.\" It was further reported to the LPA, the facility has contracted for monthly bed bug treatments since the facility had the first case of bed bugs in June of 2020. Although the facility had bed bugs, the facility has an active treatment plan. The LPA received corroborating information that when C1 complained about being bit, C1's mattress was removed from the facility the same day and C1 was given a new mattress. Allegation #2) During confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA that C1 sustained bed bug bites to C1's body approximately two weeks after C1 was placed at the facility. The facility administrator contacted the pharmacist for a consult and the pharmacist advised that over the counter Cortizone-10 Plus cream should be applied to the affected area two times a day or as needed. The consultation was done the same day the staff informed the administrator of the bites. Since the staff knew what the bites were from, the consultation was done in lieu of taking C1 to medical facility and potentially exposing the staff and client to COVID-19. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations there were bed bugs in C1's bed, the bed was sprayed but C1 still slept in the same bed and C1 has bed bug bites that likely needed medical attention may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were emailed to Mr. Tupou for signature.

    "narrative": "On the above date Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Michael Almaraz, met with All of God\u2019s Children Administrator, Cheryl Williamson, via Facetime. The purpose of the visit was to discuss additional revisions needed to the plan of operation and program statement. \u00b7Please refer to the Interim Licensing Standards version 3.1, located on the CDSS website. Plan of operation Sections H. Removal or transfer Policies and procedures 1) No mention of the staff responsible for Intake & intake process. 2) Page 159 Please remove this or make changes on how you will follow the required steps to preserve placements prior to removal. Emergency removal Upon admission during the CFTM together the treatment team, client and their family will develop a transition plan. However, an emergency removal will not allow time for a scheduled CFTM. The placement agency will be notified by phone and email when a client has been removed from AGC for emergency reasons. Reasons for removal include, but are not limited to: \u00b7 Removal becomes necessary when there is a health and safety concern for the other clients in the facility. \u00b7 All of God\u2019s Children will act to protect the therapeutic milieu that serves as a significant function of treatment and protection. \u00b7 Violence that threatens the safety of staff and other clients in the facility. \u00b7 Psychiatric care \u00b7 The client has a pervasive negative influence on the environment. (continued ...)\n\n\u00b7 If the client refuses to participate in the treatment plan, and transition plan. All efforts will be made to encourage, motivate and inspire the client to actively participate in the treatment plan. \u00b7 Crime committed against facility, such as arson, participation, or assistance in another committing such a crime. \u00b7 Removal by law enforcement officers. \u00b7 Possession of weapons \u00b7 Fire setting with property destruction or harm others \u00b7 Chronic AWOL A majority of the reasons listed for emergency removal are reasons that would require an emergency CFT. Why would the facility not be able to request or advocate for a CFT in the event a youth did not want to participate in services? This would not be grounds for a 14-day notice and per the ILS it would be a violation to 14-day a notice a youth for this without following the requirements of the ILS. Anytime a preservation CFT can be done, it must be done. -87022(c)(12)(C) and 87068.4(c) Section J. Handling Money, Personal Property, & Valuables Please revise and remove this information. 1) There is an internal contradiction in the listed \u201cdefault\u201d allowances. On page 168 it says: Children ages 06 \u2013 08 years of age will receive $5.00 per week Children ages 09 \u2013 11 years of age will receive $8.00 per week Children ages 12 \u2013 13 years of age will receive $12.00 per week Children ages 14 \u2013 17 years of age will receive $17.00 per week But on page 169 it says this: Children ages 06 \u2013 08 years of age will receive $4.00 per week Children ages 09 \u2013 11 years of age will receive $5.00 per week Children ages 12 \u2013 13 years of age will receive $7.00 per week Children ages 14 \u2013 17 years of age will receive $12.00 per week (continued...)\n\n2) The overall policy violates the prohibition on fines. The Plan of Operation says: Policy and procedures ensure that a child\u2019s cash resources are not taken in the form of fines or punishment AGC will ensure that a client\u2019s cash resources are not taken in the form of fines or punishments, unless the following requirements are met: All fines levied will be recorded and explained in the child's file, including the amount of the fine and the reason for the fine. Such fines will be maintained in an account separate from the personal or business accounts of the licensee or facility. Records will be maintained accounting for any interest earned and expenditures from the account. All fines collected will be used for the benefit of the individual child or all children in placement. The circumstances under which fines are to be imposed will be specified in writing. Allowances will not be less than what is stipulated on the County contract. However, any extra incentivized allowance may be withheld, until the next allowance issuance. Any other monies earned, acquired or accrued may be used to fund / incentivize volunteers. This is the same format for reimbursement of damaged, destroyed, broken or stolen items. This incentive may not be taken from the County contracted allowance. However, any other monies earned, acquired or accrued may be used to fund / incentivize volunteers. This is the same format for reimbursement of damaged, destroyed, broken or stolen. (pages 170-171) Most of the language in the passage quoted above is from an outdated version of ILS. ILS 3.1 makes it clear that a child\u2019s cash resources cannot be taken in the form of fines, period. ILS 87026(c). (continued...)\n\nProgram Statement Section 15. House Rules for Children/Nonminor Dependents 2) Page 212 how will a client replace broken property? -87026(c)(1) and reasonable and prudent parent standard.

Confidential interviews revealed that C1 did not have a therapy appointment on 10/07/2021 but had a WRAP appointment at home and a CFT appointment held over Zoom. Confidential interviews further revealed that C1 did not miss either of these appointments; however, C1 was late for the CFT as the Zoom had been changed and needed to get the correct meeting code. Confidential interviews also revealed that if C1 did not want to attend the therapy appointments, the staff would not make C1 attend them. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegations that staff did not seek medical attention for youth in care and staff did not assist youth with their therapy appointment may have occurred, however, it is not supported or proven by evidence.

C2 got upset because C1 broke C2's doll. C2 called C1 a derogatory name. C1 started to tantrum and went outside in the facility van. C1 then went into the living room and was yelling and screaming at the other clients. C2 was sitting on the couch. Staff #1 (S1) was standing in between C1 and C2 in order to separate the clients. C1 then grabbed a computer keyboard from the staff computer station in the living room. C1 threw the keyboard at C2 hitting C2 on the back of the head. S1 sent the clients to another room for safety while C1 continued to tantrum and walk around the facility. S1 called the administrator to report the incident. Information from confidential interviews also stated that the administrator arrived at the facility and transported C2 to the emergency room as C2's head was bleeding. It was further reported to the LPA, C1 and C2 normally got along with each other. C1 was prone to tantrums but had never physically attacked another client prior to this incident. According to the unusual incident/injury report, C1 was taken to Riverside County Regional Medical Center and diagnosed with an abrasion to the scalp. The report also indicated C1 was 11 years old, five feet in height and weighed 166 pounds. C2 was eight years old, 4' 5\" in height and weighed 60 pounds. C1 constantly engaged in frequent fighting and would hit and kick both clients and staff. C1 would use C1\u2019s size to intimidate clients and staff that were small in stature. A 14 Day Notice for Removal was given by the facility for C1. However, other information stated C1 had punched C2 on the stomach during a previous incident. C1 was very aggressive and unable to manage their behavior. C1 was like a \"tornado\" when angry and the facility was unable to manage C1's behaviors. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegation S1 did not prevent youth from engaging in a physical altercation may have occurred, however, is not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "On 11/29/22, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Belinda Torres, met with LaCobra Curry, Administrative Assistant, for the purpose of conducting an annual required inspection of the facility. A physical plant inspection was completed. The facility grounds are clean and free of debris and observable hazards. There is adequate indoor and outdoor activity space. Facility smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are in operating order. Licensee maintains an adequate supply of perishable and non-perishable foods. The menu was posted and food items were present for the listed dinner meal. All required forms are posted including the complaint procedures, personal rights, and Foster Care Ombudsman poster. Medications are locked and centrally stored in the locked garage. The hot water was tested in a client restroom at 10 AM and at 2:38 PM and the readings were 129.9 and 125.2 degrees respectively, which is not in compliance with the maximum allowable temperature of 120 degrees. LaCobra lowered the setting on the water heater at 10 AM and ran the washing machine during the inspection but the hot water temperature was still over 120 degrees. Individual beds were observed with appropriate clean linens, pillows, comforters, and mattresses in good repair. Each bedroom had a dresser for each client that provides more than three drawers of storage and a closet/portable storage for additional storage.

S2 told C1 to give the Chromebook to S2 and C1 did not want to. S2 stated she could not remember anything else about the incident as, \"There were a lot of situations.\" S2 could not remember who else was working as, \"There were a lot of situations.\" Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the allegation S1 restrained C1 is substantiated.

S1 stood in the other client's bedroom entrance to block C1 from entering. C1 started to swing at S1. S1 put S1\u2019s hand out directly in front of S1 to block C1's swings. S1 accidentally scratched C1 with S1's nails. S1 gave C1 an ice pack and wrote up an incident report. The LPA did not receive any evidence to show S1 pushed C1 or the scratch was an intentional act. S2 reported to the LPA she administered C1's medications all the time. S2 could not remember the names of the medications or what they were for. S2 denied giving C1 medication to make C1 sleep. A confidential witness reported C1 did not take any medication for sleep while at the facility.

S1 worked the nocturnal shift which was from 10 or 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. When S1 arrived to work, the clients were already asleep. The AM (day) shift were the only ones that administered the medications. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations S1 knocked C1 to the ground and C1 sustained a scratch to the face, S1 refused to report the incident, S2 overdosed C1 with medication, S1 slapped C2's leg and dragged C2 by the hair may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur.

It was stated in a confidential interview that S1 would get the medicine from the school when C1 leaves for a weekend visit or when the STRTP was not able to get a refill. A confidential interview stated that there were issues getting refills due to C1 medication changing often and the medication was not always available to be refilled. A confidential interview stated there were times when medication was missed due to the medication not being refilled. Documentation showed that the medication was supposed to be administered in the morning and the evening, but documentation reflects the medication was not administered as prescribed. There were multiple days on C1\u2019s PMR that showed discrepancies and there were days that medications were missed and not documented. Based on confidential interview and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore, the allegation that staff are mishandling C1\u2019s medication while in care is substantiated. The STRTP is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 87075 Health Related Services (c) (see LIC 9099D).

A Confidential witness statement also reported hearing C1 tell staff they (C1) knew how to hurt themselves. Likewise, other confidential interviews denied staff (S1, S2) restrained or harmed C1 and reported that C1 has a history of self-harm and making similar accusations when C1 does not get their way. LPA received conflicting information as C1 denied their injury was self-inflicted, and a confidential interview reported witnessing S1 grab C1 as alleged. Additionally, pertinent documentation also contained conflicting statements and reported that both S1 and S2 grabbed C1\u2019s arm, whereas other confidential interviews consistently reported that S1 and S2 did not cause injury to C1. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegation that staff (S1) handled minor(C1) roughly, causing bruising, is unsubstantiated.

Confidential interviews disclosed that clients C1, C2, and C6 were involved in inappropriate touching during the night. Other confidential interviews denied engaging in any inappropriate touching. Additional confidential interviews stated that an unknown staff would sleep during the night shift, so clients were able to sneak into other clients\u2019 bedrooms. (Continue on next page...)",

    "narrative": "During the safety inspection, the LPA observed the following: The two window panes in bedroom #5 (by the garage) were broken and covered. The LPA observed an employee from Ace Glass present and starting the glass repair. A1 stated a client broke the windowpanes a week prior. The windows were boarded up immediately after they were broken. There was a delay in the repair because the glass had to be custom made due to the size of the windows. There were no feces observed on the toilet, doorknobs or fixtures in both facility bathrooms as alleged. Both bathrooms were clean. A1 confirmed there was a problem with the pipe leaking underneath the kitchen sink. When the LPA asked to look in the cabinet beneath the sink, it appeared the sink was still leaking as there was a low sided rectangular plastic container under the \u2018U\u2019 pipe which was full of water. The LPA requested to see the facility\u2019s \u201cBroken Item List,\u201d which is where staff make notes of repairs for the handyman. The leak was noted but the date field was blank. However, the next entry was dated 05/19/20. A1 called the LPA later the same day and stated she spoke with their handyman. The handyman informed A1 the leak was previously repaired, but he left the plastic container under the pipe because he did not feel like moving it and spilling the water. A1 removed the container and placed a paper towel under the sink and ran the water for 15 minutes and there was no leak. A1 immediately text the LPA a picture of the area beneath the sink with the paper towel as A1 described. The paper towel appeared dry. A1 confirmed there was a dripping water leak in the great room (living room) ceiling this past winter. The leak went from the kitchen into the great room. The handyman could not repair the leak while it was raining but once it stopped raining the leak was immediately repaired. Only one bucket was used to catch the water, not five as alleged. Other information was received during confidential interviews regarding the allegation: On 06/22/20, there were feces observed on the bathroom floor and on the toilet handle. A client wiped off the feces on the toilet handle before a picture could be taken. A picture was taken of the feces on the bathroom floor and was supposed to be sent to the LPA, but as of 10/06/20 the picture was not received. However, other information was received the bathrooms are cleaned at least twice a day, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and staff have not seen feces in the bathrooms as alleged. *** Continued on next page ***\n\nThe LPA received a video, dated 04/03/20, showing water leaking from the \u2018U\u2019 pipe under the kitchen sink. There was water draining into a low sided rectangular plastic container and to the kitchen floor. The video of the leak was sent via text message to David Jones, Administrator, on 04/03/20. It was further reported the staff would have to empty out the water from the container. A week later the container was observed to have water in it and the container with water had been there ever since the complaint was reported on 06/23/20. It was reported to the LPA on 06/18/20 a client broke a bedroom window at the house. The LPA received a picture, dated 06/18/20, showing the two windowpanes broken. The LPA also received a picture, dated 06/24/20, showing the windowpanes were still broken. There was a panel, the same width as the window, leaning up against the bottom portion of the window. The panel appeared to have duct tape around the edge. However, other information was received the broken windows are usually repaired within one to three days, not three weeks as alleged. At the end of June 2020, there were three clients who did extensive property damage to the house including breaking windows. The three clients were discharged shortly after the complaint was received and the property damage incidents have declined. It was further reported to the LPA the leak in the ceiling occurred around March 2020. No details could be obtained as to how long it took for the leak to be repaired. However, other information was received the leak was repaired multiple times during the inclement weather and completely fixed once it stopped raining. The LPA also received corroborating information only one bucket was used to catch the leaking water not five as alleged. Based on the confidential interviews and the LPA\u2019s observations during the safety inspection, the allegation the facility is unclean and in disrepair may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were emailed to Mr. Tupou for signature.

Staff Plan Revision Required Missing trauma-informed training in first 8 hours of new hire training including: 1) Course title and subject matter; 2) Learning objectives and activities: 3) Number of hours per training session; 4) Training evaluation. Section F. Statement of Admission Policies and Procedures Revision Required 1) Page 119- This does not make sense and it was requested in the last set of notes to clarify. What does it mean will consider providing treatment to a client that requires restraints? My suggestion is to remove this because it does not make sense and it is not clear how you would be able to determine whether or not a youth would need restraints. Section G. Admission Agreement 1) Page 140- add the word \u201cday\u201d after 14 in first sentence of the second paragraph. 2) Page 140 ensure that this is addressed. Youth reaches age 18 - Please ensure that there\u2019s a plan in place prior to removal Please ensure that the electronic copy and the hard copy are have the pages numbered the same. 3) Facility has a zero-tolerance policy regarding bullying/discrimination of youth/NMD based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. AGC should detail the trainings or methods it will utilize to prevent or address when discrimination occurs. ILS \u00a7 87072(d)(11) Sections H. Removal or transfer Policies and procedures 1) No mention of the staff responsible for Intake & intake process. 2) Page 159 Please remove this or make changes on how you will follow the required steps to preserve placements prior to removal. A majority of the reasons listed for emergency removal are reasons that would require an emergency CFT. Why would the facility not be able to request or advocate for a CFT in the event a youth did not want to participate in services? This would not be grounds for a 14-day notice and per the ILS it would be a violation to 14-day a notice a youth for this without following the requirements of the ILS. Anytime a preservation CFT can be done, it must be done. ILS \u00a7 87022(c)(12)(C) and 87068.4(c) (continued on next page...)\n\nSection J. Handling Money, Personal Property, & Valuables Please revise and remove this information. 1) There is an internal contradiction in the listed \u201cdefault\u201d allowances. On page 168 it says: Children ages 06 \u2013 08 years of age will receive $5.00 per week Children ages 09 \u2013 11 years of age will receive $8.00 per week Children ages 12 \u2013 13 years of age will receive $12.00 per week Children ages 14 \u2013 17 years of age will receive $17.00 per week But on page 169 it says this: Children ages 06 \u2013 08 years of age will receive $4.00 per week Children ages 09 \u2013 11 years of age will receive $5.00 per week Children ages 12 \u2013 13 years of age will receive $7.00 per week Children ages 14 \u2013 17 years of age will receive $12.00 per week 2) The overall policy violates the prohibition on fines. The Plan of Operation says: Policy and procedures ensure that a child\u2019s cash resources are not taken in the form of fines or punishment AGC will ensure that a client\u2019s cash resources are not taken in the form of fines or punishments, unless the following requirements are met: All fines levied will be recorded and explained in the child's file, including the amount of the fine and the reason for the fine. Such fines will be maintained in an account separate from the personal or business accounts of the licensee or facility. Records will be maintained accounting for any interest earned and expenditures from the account. All fines collected will be used for the benefit of the individual child or all children in placement. The circumstances under which fines are to be imposed will be specified in writing. Allowances will not be less than what is stipulated on the County contract. However, any extra incentivized allowance may be withheld, until the next allowance issuance. Any other monies earned, acquired or accrued may be used to fund / incentivize volunteers. This is the same format for reimbursement of damaged, destroyed, broken or stolen items. This incentive may not be taken from the County contracted allowance. However, any other monies earned, acquired or accrued may be used to fund / incentivize volunteers. This is the same format for reimbursement of damaged, destroyed, broken or stolen. (pages 170-171) (continued on next page...)\n\nMost of the language in the passage quoted above is from an outdated version of ILS. ILS 3.1 makes it clear that a child\u2019s cash resources cannot be taken in the form of fines, period. ILS \u00a7 87026(c). Program Statement Section 4. Core Services and Supports 1) Last sentence in section four needs to be on its own page not on the section five section cover sheet. (Page 82) Section 6. Development Review, Implementation and Modification of Needs and Services Plan 1) Page 97- typo at the top Terminated should be determined Section 15. House Rules for Children/Nonminor Dependents 1) Page 215 states \u201cStaff has the right to ask the client to unlock their electronics, cell phone or computers to check the context, if misuse is suspected. Refusal to give up the phone immediately will result in loss of phone privileges\u201d \u00b7 This is a violation of client\u2019s personal rights. There shouldn\u2019t be phone checks, unless there\u2019s a court order, it\u2019s discussed and agreed upon in a CFT, and included the client\u2019s needs and services plan. 2) Page 212 how will a client replace broken property? ILS \u00a7 87026(c)(1) and 87001(r)(1) Section 17. Positive Discipline Policies 1) Page 247 number the rest of the forms of discipline or remove 7, 8 and leave the bullets. Section 20. Mental Health Program Approval 1) Page 290 is blank it seems that information (bullets)is missing On this date, All of God\u2019s Children\u2019s is recommended for licensure on a provisional basis. License will expire one year from effective date. Facility will be licensed for a capacity of ten male clients, age 6 through 17. Facility accepts only ambulatory clients.

During the course of a confidential interview, it was reported to the LPA staff did not taser C1. However, staff #1 (S1) threw C1 and slammed C1 on the floor on five occasions. S1 also purposely \"banged\" C1\u2019s head on the dresser. S1 would pick C1 up by the shoulders and the stomach and throw C1. *** Continued on next page ***",

One client room does not have a closet but the facility ordered an armoire which was scheduled to be delivered on 10/20/22 but the delivery status is showing in transit. The hot water in the client\u2019s bathrooms was measured to be between 79 degrees but the staff were doing laundry. The LPA had Cheryl turn up the setting on the water heater and advised to test water temperature later tonight. Per Cheryl, no firearms or weapons are allowed in the facility.

    "narrative": "Allegation #1) It was alleged staff did not administer one of C1's medications while C1 was placed at the facility. It was further alleged when C1 was discharged from the facility, on 06/30/21, C1 had more medication than C1 should have had. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA staff would administer C1\u2019s medications at different times other than the physician's orders. After C1 was discharged from the facility a count was completed of C1's pills and there were too many pills present. The LPA completed a review of C1's medication logs and observed the following: April 2021 log for AM dose- The entries started on the 10th and ended on the 30th. The date of each dose taken by the child was not documented for the 23rd. Log for PM dose- The month/year field was blank, it appeared it was for April 2021 . The entries started on the 4th and ended on the 28th. The entry on the 4th was \"arrived\". The date of each dose taken by the child was not documented for the following days: 26, 29, 30. May 2021 log for 7 PM dose- The entries started on the 1st and ended on the 31th. The date of each dose taken by the child was not documented for the 30th.

The dates of each dose were not documented for the following days: 1, 10, 12, 13, 15, 24, 25, 27 and 30. *** Continued on next page ***\n\nAllegation #4) It was alleged the clients watched movies that they were not supposed to be watching. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA the clients were only allowed to watch age appropriate movies. However, other information stated the clients were allowed to watch, \"Teeny Bopper,\" movies and Mortal Combat which is a rated R movie. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations C1 was removed from the facility because C1 often \"ratted\" on the facility and made negative comments about the facility, S1 hit a parked car while driving recklessly with clients, when C1 was discharged moving boxes were used instead of C1's five piece luggage set, and the clients watched inappropriate movies such as Mortal Combat may have occurred, however, are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, the LIC 811 Confidential Names and appeal rights were provided to Cheryl Williamson-Jones.\n\nAllegation #1) It was alleged C1 was removed from the facility because C1 often \"ratted\" on the facility. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA the facility requested for C1 to be discharged because C1 should have been in a lower level of care in a foster care setting. The LPA received a copy of the discharge request, dated 06/14/21, which was sent to C1's CSW. The request indicated it was the facility's belief C1 would be best served in a therapeutic foster home environment where C1 can receive the one-on-one support and attention that C1 requires. This may also provide a more comfortable setting for all parties involved in C1's care. However, other information stated C1 was removed from the facility because he often \"ratted\" on the staff and made negative comments about the facility. Allegation #2) It was alleged S1 hit a parked car while driving recklessly with clients. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA in June of 2021 S1 backed into S1's personal vehicle while driving the facility van and transporting clients. S1's vehicle was parked on the facility driveway. S1 was driving slowly and accidentally hit the bumper on S1's vehicle. The LPA did not receive any evidence that S1 was driving in an unsafe manner. S1 drove on a windy canyon road in the 14-passenger van. It was further reported to the LPA passengers sitting in the back of the van, would feel the turns. However, other information stated S1 hit a car, drove over the lines and into other lanes on the road. Allegation #3) It was alleged when C1 was discharged from the facility, moving boxes were used instead of C1's five piece luggage set. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA when C1 was discharged on 06/30/21, the facility sent C1 with the luggage they thought looked like C1's, which consisted of three matching pieces. C1 was also sent with boxes of C1's personal property. There were two other pieces of luggage at the facility but they did not look like they were part of C1\u2019s set as the two pieces were not, \u201cNicely kept.\u201d The facility sent pictures of the two pieces of luggage to the CSW but the CSW said she could not identify the luggage. The facility offered to drop off the luggage to the CSW's office. However, other information stated C1 had five pieces of luggage when C1 was placed. The CSW did not take a picture of C1's property at placement. When C1 was discharged, C1 only had three pieces of luggage. Two pieces of luggage were received by the CSW a couple weeks prior to 07/21/21. The CSW received a list of C1's inventory but had not reviewed it. The LPA obtained a copy of C1's inventory list at placement and at discharge and the luggage was not documented. *** Continued on next page ***\n\nJune 2021 log for 7 PM dose: The entries started on the 1st and ended on the 30th. The date of each dose taken by the child were not documented for the following days: 27, 29 & 30. Allegation #2) It was alleged when C1 was discharged from the facility, on 06/30/21, C1 was provided another client's medication and device used to administer the medication. During the course of confidential interviews, the LPA received corroborating information the medication and device were sent with C1's belongings upon C1's discharge. The staff subsequently picked up the medication and device from C1's CSW's office. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the staff failed to administer C1's medication as prescribed and the staff provided another client's medication and device used to administer the medication to C1 are substantiated.

The touching was consensual. C1 and C2 are nine months apart in age. They were placed in the same bedroom due to their closeness in age, size and that neither C1 or C2 were known to have sexual issues. C2 was placed on 09/07/21 and C1 was placed on 10/01/21. At no point during intake or multiple conversations with either client's county social workers, was the facility informed the clients had sexual issues or were sexually inappropriate. Due to this incident, both clients were separated and placed in other rooms with no roommates. Staff were informed of the incident and instructed to continue to supervise all clients carefully. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegation children engaged in inappropriate sexual contact occurred, however, it was not due to a lack of supervision on the facility's part. There was no known sexualized history for the clients. Once the facility became aware of the incident, the facility ended the room sharing arrangement, informed staff of the incident and instructed staff to continue to supervise all clients carefully. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to Veronica Manzo.",

The administrator set rodent traps and about one and a half to two days later, the mouse was caught. The administrator reported to the LPA that none of the staff reported the mouse to her. During the 10/22/21 safety inspection, the administrator showed the LPA the traps in the kitchen. The LPA observed a sticky pad trap in the cabinet drawer along with a Tomcat brand trap. There was another sticky pad trap on the floor next to the side of the refrigerator. During the course of confidential interviews, the LPA received information that some staff and clients observed rodent droppings in the kitchen while other staff and clients did not observe evidence of rodents. It was reported one staff observed rodent droppings a week or two after 09/02/21. The LPA received conflicting information as to whether the droppings were cleaned when first observed in September 2021. The LPA received corroborating information that rodent traps were subsequently placed in the kitchen and the garage. The garage has a keyed lock and is inaccessible to the clients. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation the facility has rodents is substantiated at this time.

    "narrative": "On 11/13/2021, it was disclosed that staff #1 (S1) told one of the other clients to fight C1 causing a laceration on the eye and the eye was purple. C1 also had a knot above C1's teeth on the gums. C1 looked homeless and wore the same clothes worn on 11/06/21. It was disclosed that staff are mean to C1 and make fun of C1 which causes C1 to be afraid to take a shower sometimes. Allegation #1) During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA C1 had multiple pairs of underwear. The clients get dressed privately so the staff are not going to know if a client is wearing underwear or not. Since the alleged incident, the staff ask C1 whether they are wearing underwear and C1 has been compliant. The LPA received corroborating information the staff complete all of the clients\u2019 laundry every morning. The staff then put the clean clothes on the table and each client gets their clean clothing. It was further reported that C1 would pick out which clothes to wear. It could have been possible that C1 wore the same clothing on 11/13/21, but the clothes would have been clean. The LPA obtained a copy of C1\u2019s clothing inventory, dated 10/01/21, 13 pairs of underwear were noted. The LPA obtained a copy of an additional inventory of C1\u2019s clothing, dated 11/15/21, 15 pairs of underwear were noted. However, other information was received that C1 only had one pair of underwear and C1 did not have clean underwear to wear. C1 looked homeless and wore the same clothes worn on 11/06/21. Allegation #2) S1 denied the allegation and stated S1 would never do that. The safety of the children is S1 and the facility's number one priority. The facility has staff present 24 hours and they supervise the clients. C1 is the one that bullies the clients. During the course of confidential interviews, the LPA received corroborating information the allegation was not true. The LPA did not receive any evidence of the alleged injury. However, other information was received S1 told one of the other clients to fight C1 causing injury to C1's eye and C1 also had a knot above C1's teeth on the gums. Allegation #3) During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA C1 had one dental visit since being placed at the facility on 10/01/21. C1 (age seven) brushes their own teeth. When C1 was placed at the facility, C1 had poor hygiene. The LPA received conflicting information as to whether C1 was afraid to take a shower. It was reported to the LPA, C1 does not like taking a shower. However, other information was received that C1 gets triggered when it is time to take a shower. It was also reported when C1 was placed, he had poor dental hygiene and silver caps on the two front teeth. ** Continued on next page **\n\nC1 had an abscess on C1's gums but it was not visible and could only be seen when C1 lifted their top lip. The LPA obtained a document, dated 11/29/21, from the facility summarizing C1's initial dental appointment. C1 had four cavities, an infection and swelling on upper front tooth causing a nickel size bump. As a result, C1 received a prescription. A follow up appointment was scheduled to have four cavities filled and two extractions completed. The facility takes the clients to the barber as needed and regularly has visits to the barber two times a month. However, other information was received, on 11/13/21, C1's teeth were yellow, and C1's hair was matted. C1 also had a knot above C1's teeth on the gums. Allegation #4) During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported C1 is provided with enough food and does not go to bed hungry. The staff cook fresh meals for the clients. The LPA received corroborating information C1 would eat more than any other client. The LPA did not receive any evidence that C1 had lost weight, especially 10-20 pounds as alleged. C1 regularly sees the doctor for a condition. If C1's weight was off, the facility would have been notified. C1 was placed at the facility on 10/01/21. On 11/19/21, the LPA obtained a copy of C1's weight record. There was only one entry and it was dated 10/08/21. It was noted C1 weighed 75.2 pounds. However other information was received, it looked like C1 had lost approximately 10-20 pounds within the prior two months. Allegation #5) During the course of confidential interviews, the LPA received consistent information the allegation was false. It was reported C1 acts out and the staff redirect C1 and give C1 consequences, which may be interpreted as the staff not liking C1. The LPA received conflicting reports as to C1 being afraid to take a shower. However other information was received, that staff are mean to C1 and make fun of C1 which causes C1 to be afraid to take a shower sometimes. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegations C1 was not wearing underwear because C1 not have any clean underwear, S1 told one of the other clients to fight C1 causing injury to C1's eye, C1 had a knot above C1's teeth on the gums, C1's teeth were yellow, C1's hair was matted, C1 looked homeless, it looked like C1 had lost approximately 10-20 pounds within the prior two months, staff are mean to C1 and make fun of C1 which causes C1 to be afraid to take a showers may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to Veronica Manzo.",

This incident has previously been investigated by CCL. It was further reported to the LPA on 05/07/22, C1 and client #4 (C4) were sitting next to each other in the facility van. C1 pulled C4's head towards C1's crotch. Since that incident, C1 has an assigned seat in the van. C1 is assigned the middle spot on the bench seat behind the driver so a visual can be kept on C1. C1 shares the master bedroom with C3. The bedroom has a bathroom. C1 was in C1's and C3's bathroom and C1 showed C1's penis to C3. C3 screamed and the staff came into the room. C3 told the staff immediately. This incident date was unknown, but it was after the facility became aware of the 10/05/21 incident. It was further reported to the LPA during the overnight hours on 06/05/22, C1 went into C2's room, held C2 down and C1 digitally penetrated C2's anus. The LPA also reviewed a facility document dated, 05/07/22, in which it was reported C1 had arrived to the STRTP from a visit. C1 was outside and was very touchy with C2. C1 pushed C2's head towards C1's private area. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met.

    "narrative": "In regard to the allegations that staff handled clients in a rough manner and staff threatened clients it was alleged that STRTP staff members normally grab clients and throw them to the ground. Furthermore, it was indicated that a staff member was seen grabbing client #2(C2) after (C2) ran outside at a Child and Family Services (CFS) office. It was also reported that on a different occasion a staff member ran after C1 and grabbed C1 by the shirt and threatened to throw C1 against a tree. During investigation, confidential interviews denied witnessing any form of physical abuse at the STRTP to any client. One confidential interview disclosed witnessing staff grab clients by the back of their shirts. Other confidential interviewers denied witnessing staff grab clients. A confidential interview indicated witnessing a staff grab a client by the arm for no reason. Additional confidential interviewers denied witnessing staff members threatening clients. LPA received conflicting information. Regarding the allegation that staff inappropriately restrain clients, it was specified that staff restrain clients down to the ground, \"police style.\" Confidential interviews denied that clients get restrained unnecessarily. Another confidential interview stated the facility staff use Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI) to avoid clients getting hurt. Additionally, confidential interviews disclosed that staff will use nonphysical interventions before clients are physically grabbed; however, when clients run towards cars, staff will attempt to grab the clients to prevent from being hit cars causing injuries. LPA received inconsistent information regarding this allegation. In regard to the allegation that staff did not provide adequate supervision resulting in client being hit by another client causing injury, it was specifically alleged that C1 was hit by another client (unknown) causing a black eye with no details. Confidential interviews stated that clients at the STRTP are aggressive, but staff try to prevent altercations. Other confidential interviews reported that C1 is the aggressor and usually starts the altercations with other clients in care. One confidential interview disclosed that an altercation happened because C1 initiated the altercation and staff would take privileges away for discipline.\n\nFinally, it was alleged that C1 is not afforded privacy. Specifically, it was reported that C1 was afraid to talk to C1\u2019s therapist because the therapist told staff what C1 discussed with the therapist. Confidential interviews mentioned that C1\u2019s sessions with the therapist were confidential and they were not discussed within the facility. One confidential interview stated that C1\u2019s school called staff about C1\u2019s behavior and staff must inform the facility Administrator about the situation. Another confidential interview indicated that the school reported that C1 made self-harm threats, and the facility Administrator reported it to the therapist for communication purposes. Based on confidential interviews and witness statements, the allegations that staff handle clients in a rough manner, staff threatened client #1(C1), staff inappropriately restrained clients, staff did not provide adequate supervision resulting in client #1(C1) being hit by another client (unknown) causing injury, and client #1 (C1) was not afforded privacy may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny these allegations. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Veronica Manzo.",

It was specified that a staff arrived at 10PM and observed that the clients were in the facility unattended. Furthermore, it was indicated that the facility manager was contacted to unlock the door because the clients were sleeping. Confidential interviews reported not witnessing clients being alone at night. Other confidential interviews did not have any knowledge of the allegation. One confidential interview reported getting up to drink water and did not observe any night staff in the facility. The same interview added that someone started to knock on the door. Another confidential interview disclosed that clients were left unsupervised approximately one to two minutes because a staff was running late to their shift and the staff that was supposed to wait left the facility premise. It was added that the staff that arrived late contacted facility manager (S1) who came within a few minutes to open the door due to the clients were already in bed. Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore, the allegation that staff left minors unattended in the facility is substantiated. The facility is being cited for the violation of General Licensing Requirements Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision 80078(a) on the attached LIC 9099D. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were reviewed and provided to Clerical Veronica Manzo.\n\nRegarding the allegation that facility does not store an adequate amount of food, it was alleged that the facility does not store enough food with no further details.

    "narrative": "A review of the supporting documentation shows that C4 was relatively new to the facility at the time of the incident and, according to confidential statements, was still adjusting to the placement. Other confidential interviews indicated that C4's refusal to return to the Group Home was not due to concerns about their safety or well-being but rather was a result of C4 feeling \"triggered\" by personal issues. Regarding the overall environment of the group home, a confidential interview mentioned that there had been instances where a staff member (S4) yelled at C4 and other clients. However, the LPA could not obtain additional information to support this claim, as additional confidential interviews consistently reported that staff maintain professionalism and appropriate boundaries when interacting with clients. It was also noted that, in addition to being trauma-informed, the Group Home provides a structured environment where all clients are treated fairly. Trauma-informed Care is integrated into the daily functions of the facility, including creating a positive and flexible environment to ensure clients feel safe when interacting with staff. Furthermore, the LPA did not receive any statements indicating that C4 or other clients have been victims of any type of abuse or felt unsafe while in care. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegation that staff did not provide a safe environment for a minor (C4) is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report, along with the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated December 19, 2024, and appeal rights, was explained and provided to Facility Manager, Justin Asieru.",

LPA Peete initiated the complaint at the Group Home on December 19, 2024. The complaint investigation included interviews with the clients in care (C2, C3, C4, and C6), the Group Home Staff (S1-S4), and the County Social Worker (CSW).

On December 11, 2024, Community Care Licensing received an allegation that staff did not provide a safe environment for a minor (C4) in care.

During LPA\u2019s visit to the facility, LPA observed that the facility has a lot of meat for making sandwiches, but not much of other types of food. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that staff are not providing adequate meals to the minors is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of the evidence has been met.

Confidential interviews indicated the facility is a hands-off facility and can\u2019t physically prevent a client from eloping. Confidential interviews indicated C2 eloped from the facility through their bedroom window at night. Confidential interviews indicated when clients attempt to elope, staff encourage clients to stay and remind them of their goals and their safety. Confidential interviews indicated staff follow clients when they are out the door, ask the clients where they are going, and report their elopement to the Sheriff\u2019s Department. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that staff are not following their emergency intervention plan procedures, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

During this inspection, 10 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 5 out of 5 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 10 Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 5 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, September 14, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments and Patterns of Escalation & Progressive Support Plan, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. Licensing Program Analyst Corina Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Kim Franck.",

LPA Hill informed the agency that the primary areas of concern at this time include: Population to be served - the specification of the youth to be served by the facility and compatibility with the other youth in the facility. There are references to parenting minors and LPA Hill questioned how supervision will be assessed for the parenting minors and their infant children. Agency states that they will not be admitting parenting minors and will remove this from the program. Services and how they are to be provided. LPA Hill explained that throughout the document the agency must explain the HOW in providing services to youth that they will accept into the program. Requirement to utilize the LIC9106A when writing their Program Statement and Plan of Operation as this document is very specific about the requirements necessary. LPA Hill also informed the agency that the cover sheets eluding to the county that they will be working and needs to be modified to remove this as it insinuates that this is a county run or county operated facility. All documentation related to the application needs to be about the applicant, the corporation, and not about individuals on the board. Not copying Title 22 and telling about the Department's requirements and HOW this applies to and will be implemented in this facility.

LPA Hill and SOC Muhammad gave the floor to Ms. Smith to ask questions about the requested changes and some of the following items were discussed and clarified for the applicant: Cover pages needed for each section with information from licensing form LIC 9106A Cell phone usage and/or restriction in the facility - this may be a violation of personal rights. It was advised that the applicant use Prudent Parent Procedures when restricting times when the cell phones are to be used or not used. Also discussed was the discussion about restriction(s) of cell phones during intake and/or during Child & Family Team Meetings when issues arise. Removal of all reference to gender in the program description so that this can be utilized for more or so that the facility can admit youth based on their gender identity versus gender at birth. Admission Agreement - ensure that any admission agreement used meets expectations set in the Interim Licensing Standards; possibly the development of an admission agreement specifically for this agency. Emergency Intervention Plan - being careful to ensure that the facility speaks to the use of the plan and what it will and will not be utilized for (i.e. property destruction) and speaking to what the facility can do. Do not include reference to what an outside agency will do or will not do when contacted for assist as this cannot be controlled by the Licensee. Analysts both discussed with Ms. Smith that the changes needed to be submitted using the strike-through method for removal of content and highlight of added content for ease of review.\n\nOther items discussed included timelines and what is to be expected. It was shared that some STRTP applications are taking longer but it all depends on how individual(s) work together and how responsive individuals are in the process. It was requested that if there are specific questions about sections, as Ms. Smith goes through to make the corrections, that they wait until the changes are completed and put all questions in one email and provide that to LPA and SOC analyst for response as there are some revisions that answer questions to other sections as the revisions are completed. It was also discussed that these applications are difficult and lengthy and SOC analyst advised that the agency give themselves grace in their review and revisions as they are doing a great job in their application. It was agreed upon that the revision is due by June 6, 2025, but Ms. Smith indicated that if there is additional time needed to finalize the review, then an email with this request will be submitted by that date. End of overall discussion about the revisions and this document was provided to Ms. Smith for signature and return to LPA Hill.",

LPA\u2019s discussed the importance of reporting incidents to the Department in a timely manner. Additionally, LPA\u2019s discussed information during an incident that occurred on 06/21/2022. The incident report indicates that a client requested staff contact Mental Health head of service on site, stating if staff did not then someone would get hurt. The report does not indicate if Mental Health was called or arrived at the facility; however, the client continued to escalate. Further, the client ran out of the facility and was not followed by staff, due to \u201csafety concerns.\u201d The client became so escalated that Fresno Police Department was contacted and he was placed on a 51/50 hold. LPA\u2019s and manager discussed the incident in depth and the importance of ensuring Mental Health Services are being utilized to attempt to de-escalate clients instead of contacting law enforcing. Additionally, AWOL procedures were discussed. .

The reason for this case management was regarding an incident report of a restraint conducted on 4/29/21 at the Bear Creek Facility. Dawn Lee explained to LPA that when this particular youth is given space and goes to his bedroom, he leaves the facility through his bedroom window, so usually staff have to supervise him by the door. After failing to place the youth in a Team Control Position, the youth became more combative. The youth fell on a bed in the bedroom and staff decided to do a prone restraint on the bed. Based on a review of the facility's program statement and the conversation with Dawn Lee, a prone restraint is only to be done as a last result, first the staff is to reassess the situation. This is a violation of the Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), 87095.01(a)(1) Emergency Interventions Prohibitions. Dawn Lee stated that she discussed the incident with her staff and counseled them on how the situation should have been handled and how these situations need to be handled moving forward. The Department determined this to be an immediate risk to health and safety of the children in care at this time, therefore the Interim Licensing Standards are being cited on the attached LIC809D.",

Based on interview with clients, there was some confusion over the \"point system\" used that determines the amount of cash a client can keep on them physically, but the amount that is deposited into their savings does not change. In-addition, there was some concern over the food menu; however, it was noted that staff allows for the clients to give suggestions and they will do their best to accommodate them.

During investigation, a confidential interview denied that C1 was sexually abused while in care and added that C1 was in care for a short period of time. Confidential interview could not recall a report made by C1 about a sexual abuse incident involving C1 and the facility. Other confidential interviews stated that C1 left the facility on a continuous basis but there was no indication that C1 was sexually abused while in care due to C1 not disclosing sexual abuse allegations to facility staff. Other confidential interview denied that C1 was sexually abused while in care or knowing that a sexual abuse incident involving C1 occurred at the facility. Another confidential interview stated feeling safe in care, liking the placement, and denied witnessing sexual abuse while in care. C2, and C3 could not be reached for comment regarding the allegation that C1 was sexually abused while in care. C2, and C3 were reported being in care at time of the complaint and may or may have not been witnesses to the allegation previously mentioned. LPA could not determine whether C1 was sexually abused while in care due to receiving inconsistent information. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that C1 was sexually abused while in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Youth Specialist, Leilani Brown",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that staff provided cigarettes to minors in care and staff allowed minor(s) to use marijuana while in care. The investigation revealed corroborating statements that staff were instructed to provide minors one cigarette per day. The Director purchased the cigarettes and were kept in the facility\u2019s office. Staff were also instructed to allow minors to take walks outside the facility, unsupervised, knowing that minors smoke marijuana or cigarettes during those walks. One minor reported being allowed to use marijuana while in care, but minor stopped using because minor wanted to transition to foster care and be adopted. The dispensing of cigarettes to minors by staff and permission to go on unsupervised walks ended after staff reported to Director that the minors were out of control. Minors started taking long walks or going for walks late at night, and minors started smoking in the facility\u2019s back yard. Director denied providing cigarettes to minors and explained that the cigarettes in the facility office were confiscated from minors. Director did not want the minors smoking at the facility, so minors were allowed to go out for walks, knowing that they were going to smoke marijuana or cigarettes. Director explained that allowing those walks was an attempt to work with the minors and not request for their removal. Director admitted to oversights during initial operation of the facility but has since made changes to the program by implementing a zero-tolerance policy to drugs and requesting notices to minors who refuse to follow rules. Based on the above information, the allegations are substantiated. The preponderance of evidence standard was met based on corroborating statements obtained. See LIC 9099D for deficiency citations issued under Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS). LPA discussed the findings and a plan of correction with the facility representative. An exit interview was conducted, and the following reports were provided at the conclusion of the LPA\u2019s inspection: LIC 9099, LIC9099C, LIC9099D, LIC 811 Confidential Names Form and Appeal Rights forms.\n\nMinor was allowed weekend visitations with minor\u2019s potential foster-adoptive parents. Confidential interviews reveal that the minor had a parental relationship with the two staff and there was no inappropriate behavior or relationship witnessed by any of the interviewees. There was no corroborating evidence found to support any sexual relationship between the parties involved and no evidence that staff was pregnant. Based on the above information, the allegations are unsubstantiated because there was no evidence found to support it. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, the standard of preponderance of evidence was not met. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this signed report, the Confidential Names form, and Appeal Rights forms were provided at the conclusion of the inspection.",

Facility staff denied the above allegations further indicating that every child placed in their facility is treated with respect, dignity and adheres to the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards. Complaint procedures were laminated and posted on the wall along with other Licensing required documents. Facility staff denied mismanaging medication however further disclosed that the only issues they have had were clients refusing to take their medication which was addressed appropriately by notifying agencies and clients physicians. S1 indicated that a former employee was hired as an Administrator after completing the Administrator course however after further review of their personal files it was revealed that the employee provided transcripts were fraudulent, and the employee was immediately terminated. The incident was documented and reported to the facility monitoring LPA. During personal file review, LPA Moroney observed health screening LIC503 and other required documents were up to date and filed accordingly. As to the allegation of staff speaking inappropriately and in a demeaning manner toward clients was denied by staff and clients. Information obtained from CSW1 did not corroborate the alleged allegations and further indicated that there are no concerns to the health and safety of the clients residing in the facility. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated.

In an interview conducted, one child stated that for a period of time in the facility, some of the other children would physically bully them. The child stated that this ended after he began standing up for himself. The child stated that when he would get bullied, staff would attempt to redirect everyone by separating them. The child reported no injuries sustained during the incidents. The child stated that he felt safe in the home and that staff would always assist him if needed it. The child stated that there were usually 3-4 staff members working at any given time and that they were always nice and professional. In interviews conducted, two other children confirmed that staff were always kind and helpful. They both felt safe in the home and felt like they could always ask staff for assistance if needed. Both other children also stated that when fights or disagreements would occur in the home, staff would redirect the children and take away privileges as a form of discipline if applicable. In an interview conducted, one staff member stated that all employees were vigilant with their supervision and would break up disagreements or fights as soon as they started. Fights have not resulted in injuries and the children generally get along for the most part. Another staff member interviewed confirmed that staff were always supervising the children and that any physical disagreements would be redirected immediately. The children would get into arguments every once in awhile but it has never resulted in serious injuries. A review of records revealed no indications that there are any issues with a lack of supervision in the home. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to suggest that the above allegation occurred. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegation is deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, along with the Licensee's Rights, were provided to the Licensee.",

Interviews revealed that while C1 and her male friend were walking around the park, supervising staff S2 remained in the car while keeping visual of C1. At some point, S2 lost sight of C1 and this is when C1 went inside the restroom with male friend and engaged in sexual intercourse. S2 nor any facility staff was unaware of the said incident until C1\u2019s mom reported it to the facility Director after C1 disclosed the incident to mom. S2 admitted that he did not get off the car and just stayed there while maintaining visual of C1. S2 stated that he would lose sight of C1 at times, but not for more than 5 minutes. Interviews with PO and IPO indicated concerns regarding (1) facility\u2019s lack of supervision, (2) for allowing C1 to go meet a male friend and not ensuring close supervision of C1 and (3) if incident was reported to the Department. The incident occurred on 12/10/22 but was not reported to the Department until 12/29/22 due to no facility staff were aware of such incident until C1\u2019s bio mom reported it to them on 12/28/22.

They have stated that they had already informed the biological parents about the C1\u2019s IEP, which was agreed to on May 10th, 2022. They further state that the biological parents were also present during an IEP meeting with C1\u2019s school and two facility staff members on April 19th, 2022. Initially, the facility staff informed the biological parents every week, however, facility staff were instructed by C1's Probation Officer to communicate all information through probation, as the parents disagreed with C1's treatment plan and program. The facility staff has documented all incidents and reported them to the supporting agencies promptly. Moreover, the staff confirmed that C1 was taken to school, but there were instances where C1 would refuse to attend school and refused prescribed medications, regardless of the interventions and support provided by the staff. Due to subsequent attendance issues, C1 fell behind in missed schoolwork, which C1 neglected to complete and thus C1\u2019s grades suffered. A medical incident concerning C1 occurred at the facility, which was handled accordingly by the staff, wherein C1 was transported to a medical center for further evaluation. S1 confirmed that hygiene products are provided to all clients upon intake and kept in abundance. Clients can request specific hygiene products or brands, which will be purchased by the facility. The staff has denied the allegation that the facility did not have enough food. The staff indicated that perishable items are purchased weekly along with any items that the clients may request and that the facility only had two clients during this time. C2 denied the alleged allegations, stating that they feel safe residing at the facility and that the staff is very supportive and provides clients with whatever is needed. C2 indicated that the facility provides an abundance of healthy food options and that staff will ask clients for meal ideas to include clients\u2019 preferences while ensuring that meals include the five food groups. The Probation Officer confirmed that the facility did provide in-service programs and services, but C1 refused to participate in the services provided and did not take medication as prescribed. In response to the allegation that the facility is facing financial difficulties, the staff denied the claim and confirmed that the facility is currently operational and compliant with the Interim Licensing standards. Additionally, the Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) obtained copies of the 2022 tax return, tenant ledger, and bank statements, which showed that the facility is financially stable and not under any distress. Based on the information received, the above allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the Facility Manager.",

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the following: Administrators Mr. Smith has submitted five (5) administrator documents for their seven (7) California City facilities. Per LPA review, only one (1) candidate met STRTP administrator qualifications. Mr. Smith explained their challenges and difficulty in finding qualified administrators due to their facilities\u2019 location. Mr. Smith will submit a letter requesting for administrator exception and a documentation of the efforts the facility has taken in finding qualified administrators. Mr. Smith will also re-submit administrator documents with updated proof of education and experiences. Capacity Reduction Mr. Smith requested clarity on the need to reduce their capacity from 6 to 4, on some of their facilities. Some of their 6-bed facilities have converted the 3rd room into their mental health/staff office, leaving 2 rooms to accommodate 4 clients. Mr. Smith explained that they can easily convert the office back to another bedroom to accommodate a maximum of 6 should the need arises, as they have the beddings and furniture in storage readily available for use. Mr. Smith stated that capacity/bed reduction at this time will affect their mental health contract with the county. LPM will discuss this issue with the MPRO Regional Manager. Update to the Program Statement The facility is currently updating their Program Statement based on STRTP ILS Version 5. Mr. Smith asked if their STRTP for 1 or 2 program should be attached to the Program Statement as an addendum. LPM will consult with RM on this issue. Other matters were also discussed like Mental Health Renewal status and suggestions as to what the facility can do regarding property damages caused by clients. The meeting ended at 11:00 AM. A copy of this report was provided to Mr. Smith.",

    "narrative": "The Following Allegation was reported: 1. The staff did not accord child dignity in their relationship with staff or other persons. The personnel (S1, S2, and S3) at the facility firmly rejected any claims or allegations suggesting that their agency endorses racism, anti-trans attitudes, or anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments among its staff. They emphasized that their team is composed of individuals from a wide range of ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds, which reflects their dedication to diversity and inclusion. The staff highlighted that this diverse makeup not only improves the workplace environment but also fosters a culture of respect and understanding among colleagues. The staff asserted that they have not witnessed any staff member exhibiting disrespectful behavior towards any client, stressing that such actions are intolerable and will be addressed without delay. S1,S2, and S3 further indicated that C1 has previously used inappropriate language or made derogatory remarks while listening to music. The staff members have advised C1 to refrain from music that demeans women and contains racial slurs. In response, C1 identified herself as a African American, asserting her right to use the term \"Nigga\" and to select her music. S1 noted that staff have reminded C1 that the impact of certain words may differ for others who might overhear them and could find them offensive. C2 reported that they have not observed any staff members at the facility disrespecting clients or making derogatory comments. They also mentioned that upon their initial placement at the STRTP, some staff members (whose names were not disclosed) did not use their preferred pronouns. However, these staff members corrected themselves and subsequently apologized. C2 also pointed out that C1 tends to create challenges for the staff by being confrontational and by playing music with lyrics that include profanity, racial slurs, and derogatory remarks about women. Additionally, the information gathered from the County Social Worker (CSW) revealed that C1 has not expressed any of the aforementioned concerns in her monthly meetings, Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings, or during phone conversations. The CSW also noted that C1 has a pattern of creating false narratives to influence others or when her wishes are not fulfilled. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Foster Family Agency. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time.

The Staff (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the claims, asserting that every member of the team is thoroughly trained in the proper procedures for handling and dispensing medications. This training ensures that all medications are administered to clients strictly according to the doctor's prescriptions and guidelines. The staff expressed their commitment to maintaining high standards of care and safety in the medication management process. Additionally, information from C1 and C2 verified that all medications were administered as prescribed and were only missed when the clients chose not to take them. 2. The staff does not allow the minor in care to go on outings. The staff members (S1, S2, and S3) denied the allegation, stating that one of their primary goals is to encourage clients to participate in outings, which helps promote social interaction and personal growth. Additionally, they emphasized their commitment to fostering independence among clients who are of age, as this is a crucial part of preparing them for transition into a transitional program. The staff believes that these efforts are essential for equipping clients with the skills and confidence they need for successful autonomy in the future. Information obtained from C1 and C2 corroborated the above statements made by staff. 3. The staff does not treat minor(s) with dignity. The staff members (S1, S2, S3, and S4) denied the allegations, further stating that each staff member has undergone comprehensive training in trauma-informed care, which equips them with the necessary skills to understand and effectively respond to the needs of clients who have experienced trauma. Furthermore, they highlighted the vital role of fostering a safe and healthy environment for all clients, emphasizing that such an environment is essential for promoting client well-being and supporting their journey toward success. Through their training and dedication, the staff are committed to providing the necessary support and resources to help clients thrive. Information obtained from C1 and C2 indicated that they felt safe and got along well with the staff.\n\nAdditionally, statements from CSW1 confirmed that they have no concerns regarding the care and supervision provided to their client. Furthermore, their client (C1) has not reported any incidents of misconduct by the facility staff.

S1 and S2 denied the allegation, affirming that client safety remains their highest priority. They stated that the facility maintains staffing levels of one to three employees, depending on operational needs, in compliance with STRTP Interim Licensing Standards requiring a 1:4 staff-to-client ratio. Regarding the February 27, 2025, incident involving clients C1 and C2, staff reported that both clients were initially in their rooms. C1 exited their room to ask C2 to lower the volume of the music. S2 confirmed the music was not loud and that C2 complied with the request. Shortly after, C1 returned to their room and closed the door. Within minutes, S1 observed C1 quickly exit toward the living room. Upon hearing the gas stove activate, S1 and S2 responded immediately and found C1 in the kitchen with a lit piece of paper towel inside a cup. C1 ran to C2\u2019s room, opened the door, and threw the burning object near the entrance. S1 promptly extinguished it with a water bottle. C1 then locked themselves in their room. In reaction, C2 became distressed, forcibly pushed past staff, and broke C1\u2019s door. Staff intervened with verbal redirection, reminding C1 of the seriousness of their actions and soon be considered an adult. S1 and S2 physically separated the clients, preventing further harm. Mental health services were contacted, and no law enforcement involvement was necessary as staff effectively de-escalated the situation. As a follow-up, each client was assigned a dedicated staff member, and the facility now ensures a minimum of two staff members on duty at all times. S1 additionally informed the LPA that C2 is preparing for transition to an independent living program. All required agencies received prompt notification of the incident. Moreover, confidential statements obtained from client C2 refuted the allegation, confirming that the facility staff are always present and that clients receive regular monitoring by the staff. C2 conveyed that they felt safe residing at the facility and valued the engagement of the facility staff with the clients. Information collected from the ER worker suggested that there are no concerns regarding the care and supervision offered to clients, and that the staff implemented suitable measures and established a plan to avert any future incidents. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore, the allegation(s) are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the STRTP Administrator. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Administrator.",

    "narrative": "This is an amended LIC9099C to the original issued on 05/23/2025. Confidential interviews confirmed that S4 violated facility policy which states that staff should be \u201chands off\u201d. Staff are not permitted to use physical force toward clients. If a restraint is required, it is only used as a last resort after attempting de-escalation techniques, and two staff members are to be present to perform the restraint. Confidential interviews reported that S4 was the only staff present at the facility when the incident occurred, and corroborating statements supported by evidence, showing that S4\u2019s self-defense claims were disproved. It was reported that S4 did not attempt to evade, separate from C1, or de-escalate the situation. Video footage corroborated that S4 was \u201cantagonizing\u201d C1. In addition, S4 initiated the confrontation and aggressively walked towards C1 multiple times. Furthermore, the evidence shows S4 physically assaulting C1 by wrestling and throwing C1 to the ground resulted in C1\u2019s broken arm. The aggressive behavior shown by S4 toward C1 indicated that S4 did not provide trauma-informed care or show a regard for C1\u2019s well-being, showing S4 acted in a way to violate licensing regulations that state minors are to be treated respectfully. Moreover, based on the evidence, S4 was arrested for PC 243(D)- Battery with serious bodily injury and PC 273a(a)- child abuse with possible great bodily injury. Based on confidential interviews and supportive evidence, the allegation that a Minor (C1) sustained broken arm while in care and facility staff (S4) do not treat minor (C1) with dignity and respect is substantiated. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 87072 Personal Rights (c)(16), which states (c) The licensee shall ensure that each child, regardless of whether the child is in foster care, is accorded the personal rights\u2026 (16) To be free of physical, sexual, emotional, or other abuse, and from corporal or unusual punishment, exploitation, infliction of pain, humiliation, intimidation, ridicule, coercion, threat, mental abuse, or other actions of a punitive nature \u2026 An Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) determination is pending. If an ECP is assessed a CCL representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment. The Program Administrator approved the assessment of this Enhanced Civil Penalty. Therefore, an ECP was issued to this facility in the amount of $2,500 on the {LIC809 and LIC421}. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were provided to Facility Manager Shaun Dwyer.",

The investigation was conducted by Special Investigator (Inv) Jesus Gonzalez of the Community Care Licensing (CCL) Investigations Bureau. The investigation included interviews with the facility staff (S1-S3), clients in care (C1-C3), and the County Social Worker (CSW). Inv Gonzlez attempted to interview S4, but S4 declined to provide a statement. On February 26, 2025, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received allegations that a minor (C1) sustained a broken arm while in care and facility staff (S4) do not treat minor (C1) with dignity and respect. It was alleged that S4 and C1 got into a physical altercation which resulted in in C1 sustaining a dislocated left elbow and a fractured radius bone. Inv Gonzalez obtained sufficient evidence to support the allegations. (Continued on LIC 9099C)",

The allegations that a Minor (FC1) sustained a broken arm while in care and facility staff (S1) do not treat a minor (FC1) with dignity and respect were substantiated. The investigation provided sufficient evidence that S1 physically assaulted FC1, resulting in FC1 sustaining a broken arm. The STRTP was cited from the Interim Licensing Standards(ILS) 87072 Personal Rights (c)(16), which states (c) The licensee shall ensure that each child, regardless of whether the child is in foster care, is accorded the personal rights\u2026 (16) To be free of physical, sexual, emotional, or other abuse, and from corporal or unusual punishment, exploitation, infliction of pain, humiliation, intimidation, ridicule, coercion, threat, mental abuse, or other actions of a punitive nature \u2026 Based on an analysis of confidential interviews and documentation, the Department has determined that an ECP is warranted for the facility not ensuring FC1\u2019s personal rights were protected, as a result, FC1 was subjected to physical abuse by S1, which resulted in serious bodily injury.

Statements obtained from the confidential interviews did not provide sufficient information to corroborate the allegations. The staff that were interviewed stated that the facility is not a lock-down facility. Therefore staff is not allowed to physically prevent residents from leaving. Facility staff stated that residents are verbally encouraged not to go AWOL. The staff stated that law enforcement was called once the foster youth began engaging in inappropriate behaviors in order to de-escalate the situation. The staff stated that the foster youth broke a window and the window was immediately boarded up on the same day. Facility staff called in a work order to have the window repaired the next day. The county social worker stated that the foster youth was in need of a higher level of care and the facility staff did their best. LPA Mundo was unable to get a statement from the foster youth. There was no corroborating information obtained through the interviews and review of records to confirm the allegation.

On 10/31/23, LPA Martinez emailed the RP seeking a statement regarding the incident under investigation. Despite efforts by LPA Martinez, the reporting party's statement was absent from the investigation. On 10/19/23, LPA Martinez approached the neighbors to discuss the complaint investigation. Despite this attempt, the neighbors declined to provide a statement. On 09/11/23, the department received a complaint alleging that staff did not provide adequate supervision to youth in care. Confidential interviews consistently revealed that staff are always available for supervision. All interviewed staff members (S1, S2, S3), along with C1, reported that staff is available to provide supervision. Additionally, staff members receive ongoing training in handling crises, ensuring they are prepared to handle challenging situations. Daily logs help maintain effective communication among staff. The staff members consistently stated that the youth placed in the facility are always under supervision. The staff interviewed denied the allegation that the facility failed to provide adequate supervision to the youth in their care. Based on the confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation against license 157807000 is unsubstantiated. An unsubstantiated determination means the allegation lacks a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the violation occurred. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time.

    "narrative": "S1 and S2 denied the allegations, asserting that they are both certified in Professional Assault Crisis Training (Pro-Act) and will utilize this training only as a last resort to prevent self-harm among clients or to protect others from harm. S2 additionally noted that all staff members are trained in trauma-informed care and will employ effective communication strategies to de-escalate potential conflicts. S1 and S2 mentioned that physical interventions may include blocking by proximity or guiding clients to a safer location. They also reported an incident that took place on July 12, 2024, involving C1, who, after receiving a phone call informing them of a family member's passing, became emotionally distressed and threw an object at a wall shelf, resulting in its collapse. S1, who was seated in the office adjacent to C1's room, heard the disturbance and went to assess the situation. Upon opening the door, S1 was met with C1's demand to \"get the fuck out of her room.\" S1 observed C1 with their head down on the bed and the shelf on the floor and refusing to engage in conversation. Shortly thereafter, C1 requested a hammer to reattach her bookshelf to the wall. When S1 offered assistance, C1 declined, and since C1 was at baseline, S1 provided the hammer. S1 then positioned themselves at the doorway of C1's room and watched as C1 attempted to rehang the shelf before returning to the office. While at their desk, S1 noticed C1 exit her room and head towards the back door. S1 followed C1, who then threatened to strike S1 with the hammer if not left alone. C1 subsequently used the hammer to damage the outside cameras and continued into the facility to break the cameras located inside. S1 reported that upon entering the facility, she contacted S2, who arrived shortly thereafter to provide assistance. S2 noted that upon their arrival, they observed C1 wielding a hammer and refusing to relinquish it to S1, while also making threats to strike S1 with the hammer. Given the emergency situation and the risk of physical harm, S1 swiftly attempted to secure the hammer from C1, resulting in C1 dropping it on the floor. Subsequently, S2 secured the cooperation of C1 and instructed S1 to retrieve the hammer and place it in the staff office. S2 explained that C1 was held back solely to prevent C1 from accessing the hammer or inflicting harm on another (S1). Upon S1's return from the office, C1 exhibited signs of distress and attempted to reach out to S1; however, C1 lost their balance and fell to the ground, requiring a brief support on C1\u2019s arm and shoulder that lasted no longer than forty seconds. S2 then advised S1 to return to the office, while C1 attempted to jump out of the living room window. S2 intervened by grasping C1's hand and pulling C1 back, cautioning C1 about the dangers of attempting to leave the facility without proper attire, as they were only wearing a t-shirt and undergarments. C1 subsequently hurried to their room, expressing a need to smoke, and took a cell phone along with marijuana vape pens, attempting to smoke in the presence of S2. S2 intervened, confiscating the contraband and informing C1 that, due to a court order, possession of a cell phone was prohibited. Subsequently, S2 initiated a dialogue with C1, who disclosed that their behavior was influenced by the recent passing of a family member. At this point, S2 offered assistance, which C1 opted to refuse. Based on information obtained during interviews describing the incident in question, the circumstances involved did not result in the usage of restraints or meet the restraint criteria. Additionally, findings from the investigation indicated that the personnel had received training in Pro-Act and employed the correct techniques when applying restraints. The facility's staff documented the application of restraints and promptly submitted Serious Incident Reports (SIRs) to the relevant agencies. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Foster Family Agency. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Facility Manager.",

CM #1: This case management is to follow-up on how the facility is accepting clients. In July 2023, the facility accepted a pregnant client. The facility\u2019s program statement does not include pregnant teens in their population to be served. Per LPA\u2018s telephone conversation with the facility\u2019s Director, Thandi Smith, the client was accepted into the facility as an emergency placement. The Director stated that his understanding is that the facility, as STRTP of 1 or 2, can accept generalized population for as long as they have high risk behaviors. This issue has been discussed in a telephone meeting conducted on 02/06/24 between LPA and the facility\u2019s director. A Technical Violation (TV) is being issued, see LIC9102TV. CM #2: On 07/11/23, a Law Enforcement Contact Report indicated that client C1 had access to the laundry detergent from the company vehicle. Based on the review of the incident report and an interview with staff S1, the laundry detergent was among other things S1 and C1 shopped for before the incident happened. As soon as they reached the facility, C1 got off the vehicle and walked in the middle of the street while moving vehicles were driving by. Due to safety concerns, S1 had to get in the vehicle again and followed C1 before he could put the detergent inside the facility and away from clients. S1 was able to get C1 back into the vehicle and this was when C1 gained access to the detergent. Due to S1\u2019s action to prioritize C1\u2019s safety first, no deficiency citation is being issued. No further follow-up is needed. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was provided to the facility representative.",

The inspection aimed to deliver the finding(s) regarding the complaint allegation(s). On April 23, 2024, the Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services received a complaint from the Centralized Complaint and Information Bureau (CCIB) with the following allegation(s): The facility staff is not arranging transportation for youth as needed. This LPA conducted the investigation of the above allegation(s) and it consisted of but was not limited to a review of records, including the client\u2019s needs and services plans, medical records, and interviews with the two staff members (S1) on 5/2/24, S2 on 5/2/24, 1 client (C1) on 5/2/24, and the CSW on 5/22/24. (Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated June 25, 2024). The Following Allegation(s) were reported: 1. The facility staff is not arranging transportation for youth as needed. Staff members S1 and S2 denied the accusation by clarifying that during the alleged incident, C1 had called from school requesting to be picked up because of feeling unwell. They explained that they received three calls, two of which were distorted with static and cutting in and out, making it challenging to understand the message. On the third call, they identified C1's voice but still struggled to comprehend due to the background noise. S1 was then sent to the school to conduct further investigation. Upon arrival, S1 was informed that C1 was indeed unwell and required assistance returning to the facility. S1 reassured the school that it would be taken care of but had to go back to the facility to get the facility car as personal vehicles were not permitted for client transportation. S1 informed school staff that they would return within fifteen minutes to accompany C1 back to the facility. The information gathered from C1 confirmed the aforementioned and additionally mentioned that they did not encounter any problems with transportation and that it was the only instance. Details obtained from the CSW revealed that during their interactions with C1, no concerns were observed, and C1 did not face any transportation issues. Furthermore, it was disclosed that the facility staff are highly attentive and supportive towards their clients. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened is are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Foster Family Agency. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Facility Manager.",

The staff members (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5) denied these allegations, asserting that all staff are trained in trauma-informed care practices, which emphasize de-escalation, empathy, and non-violent communication. These practices aim to prevent retraumatization and to ensure the emotional and physical safety of clients. Additionally, several staff members indicated that each staff member has undergone Pro-Act training, a comprehensive program that details safe and ethical physical intervention techniques. Such techniques are employed only as a last resort when there is an imminent risk of harm to the client or others, utilizing the least restrictive measures necessary to maintain safety. The staff members stated that no physical intervention was needed or performed during the incident. They maintain that C1 was verbally redirected and that no physical contact took place between S3 and C1. C2 refuted the claim, stating that they have never witnessed or heard of any employee hitting or mistreating any client. C2 emphasized that the staff is highly supportive and offers everything necessary to guarantee success with their program. The statement obtained from C1 did not corroborate the above allegations due to C1 providing contradicting information to various interviewers, including Law Enforcement, Kern County (SSP), and LPA.

C1 admitted to doing the piercing herself but refused to disclose further details as to when, where, why and how she did the piercing. No staff member was aware that C1 had a tongue piercing until staff S1 noticed it during mealtime when C1 was refusing to eat. S1 was able to encourage C1 to remove the piercing. Staff also encouraged C1 to seek medical attention but C1 refused. C1 was given over-the-counter medication and was monitored for possible infection. In a telephone interview with SFM on 08/30/23, C1\u2019s tongue has healed. The incident was reported to the appropriate agencies. No further follow-up is needed regarding the incident. No citations are being issued during today\u2019s inspection. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the Supervising Facility Manager.",

Confidential interviews were conducted that included, but were not limited to: the Administrator at the facility on January 20, 2023; client (see Confidential Names, LIC 811 Ref. #1 dated May 5, 2023) at school. The LPA was unable to interview the County Social Worker after several attempts. The LPA reviewed Ref. #1's Needs and Services Plan, and Special Incident Reports. The investigation revealed that Ref. #1 is allowed 30 minutes of video call with a specific family member and there are family members that Ref. #1 is not allowed a call. Ref. #1 is allowed to call other family members. Based on the interview with Ref. #1, Ref. #1 does not have problems using the telephone at the facility and has privacy on occasion. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegation. There was no preponderance of the evidence to substantiate the allegation. So, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding this allegations. A copy of this complaint was provided to the facility representative.",

    "narrative": "5. The staff is interfering with a minors telephone calls. The team (S1, S2, and S3) rebuffed the allegation and stated that C1 is allowed to have supervised phone conversations with his biological mother daily. Nevertheless, there are instances when C1 declines to engage with his parents, gets upset, and either abruptly terminates the call or goes as far as damaging the phone. S1 indicated that they have had to repeatedly caution C1's parents against scolding him for school-related matters, inquiring about the services he is receiving, or directing the therapist on what to do. Furthermore, S1 mentioned that they have sought advice from C1's CSW, who recommended that they advise the parents to contact the CSW for any questions regarding C1's NSP. 6. The staff yelled at a minor while in care and used inappropriate language towards a minor. The team (S1, S2, and S3) rebutted the accusation, underscoring that such actions from staff members are unacceptable and will be handled appropriately. They pointed out that staff members have needed to speak loudly to verbally guide clients in order to prevent verbal conflicts. The team refuted any assertions of clients or staff members reporting inappropriate language being used by any staff member towards them or in their presence. S1 also mentioned that clients often resort to swearing at each other or staff members when they are upset and do not receive their desired outcome. 7. The staff does not prevent a minor from accessing inappropriate material while in care. The team (S1, S2, and S3) disproved the alleged accusation and provided supplementary details. They stated that C1's father had gifted him a PlayStation virtual gaming system and had set up an account for him. The team clarified that the staff was unaware of C1 accessing inappropriate content, which his father discovered while checking the account from home. Additionally, the team mentioned that C1's parents expressed frustration during a supervised phone call, holding the staff responsible for not monitoring C1's activities on his virtual headset. The team explained to the parents that, as they had established the account, they were unable to search or monitor the content C1 was accessing due to it violating C1's personal rights and California privacy laws, as the account was created under C1's father's name. 8. The staff mishandled a minors personal belongings, and the staff does not safeguard a minors personal belongings. During a phone call, S1 acknowledged that C1's parents had expressed concerns about some Legos that were bought for C1. C1 claimed that the staff had caused damage to their Legos. S1 clarified that neither the staff nor any other client had ever reported taking or damaging personal belongings. S1 explained that C1, when angry with their parents or when the staff intervened to stop them from doing certain things, would intentionally break their own things. As a result of this behavior, C1 had broken their room window, kicked the wall and created holes in it, and thrown their toys against the wall. Eventually, C1 would throw away these toys as they were no longer usable. The team also emphasized that clients who have personal belongings they want to keep safe can ask a staff member to keep these items in the staff office to prevent any damage. Information obtained from C2 and C3 confirmed the aforementioned details and revealed that they feel secure residing at the facility and believe that the staff is assisting them in accomplishing their personalized plan. Additionally, the CSW mentioned that the facility staff were highly attentive and supportive, frequently engaging in communication with them regarding matters concerning C1 and their biological parents. The CSW disclosed that, due to the excessive involvement of the biological parents, the facility staff were required to report all incidents to the CSW, who would then relay the information to the biological parents.

    "investigation_findings": "13On June 25, 2024, at 1:30 PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Winston Moroney conducted a complaint inspection at the above Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) and met with the Facility Manager Willy Ayala. The inspection aimed to deliver the finding(s) regarding the complaint allegation(s). On April 23, 2024, the Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services received a complaint from the Centralized Complaint and Information Bureau (CCIB) with the following allegation(s): The staff does not ensure a minor is performing at school, the staff does not communicate effectively with the authorized representative, the staff does not properly report incidents involving a minor, the staff does not answer the facility telephone, the staff is interfering with a minors telephone calls, the staff yelled at a minor while in care, the staff used inappropriate language towards a minor, the staff does not prevent a minor from accessing inappropriate material while in care, the staff mishandled a minors personal belongings, and the staff does not safeguard a minors personal belongings. This LPA conducted the investigation of the above allegation(s) and it consisted of but was not limited to a review of records, including the client\u2019s needs and services plans, medical records, and interviews with the two staff members (S1) on 1/24/24, S2 on 1/24/24, (S3) on 1/24/24, 2 of 3 clients (C2, and C3) on 1/24/24, and the CSW on 1/31/24. C1 declined to be interviewed, so no statement was obtained from them.(Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated June 25, 2024). The Following Allegation(s) were reported: 1. The staff does not ensure a minor is performing at school. The team (S1, S2, and S3) denied the allegation by stating that they, along with other child support groups, held multiple Collaborative Family Team (CFT) meetings with school staff to monitor C1's academic advancement. Despite their efforts, there were times when C1 would refuse to adhere to his individualized plan and would sometimes show aggression towards the team members who were assisting him with his assignments. 2. The staff does not communicate effectively with the authorized representative. The accusation was firmly denied by the team (S1, S2, and S3), who also emphasized their exceptional communication with C1's CSW, school staff, and other supporting agencies. The team reassured that they would diligently report any incidents to C1's CSW on a daily basis. Furthermore, it was disclosed that the team often received phone calls from C1's biological mother, who would express frustration when informed that she should contact the CSW for information. This stemmed from the biological mother's attempt to impose her own beliefs regarding what was in C1's best interest. 3. The staff does not properly report incidents involving a minor. The team (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the allegation by confirming that they upheld continuous communication with C1's CSW and expeditiously informed all pertinent agencies of any occurrences via email. 4. The staff does not answer the facility telephone. The team (S1, S2, and S3) rebutted the allegation by clarifying that the phone is regularly monitored by staff members. If there are situations at the facility that prevent them from answering the phone, they are prepared to promptly return calls. Continued...",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that one staff member at the facility made inappropriate comments towards multiple clients in care. The alleged comments ranged from derogatory remarks to general disrespect. In interviews conducted, one child stated that the staff member did indeed use derogatory remarks towards clients in care and was verbally abusive in general. However, three other children stated that they had not seen or heard of the staff member ever making inappropriate comments, or verbally abusing any clients in care. Two children stated that the staff member was more strict than others but would remain professional in dealing with the clients. All children interviewed revealed that they felt safe in the home and could count on staff members to help them with anything that they needed. In interviews conducted, four staff members denied the allegation and stated that they have not seen or heard of any staff members in the facility making inappropriate statements to clients in care. Staff reiterated that even though clients may be challenging and frustrating at times, they are trained to be gentle and understanding towards clients in care. A review of records revealed no indications that staff have ever been verbally abusive towards clients in care. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the above allegation occurred. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, there were no outside witnesses to confirm whether the incidents were improperly supervised and if they could have been prevented. Therefore, the allegation is deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED. An exit interview was conducted and a signed copy of this report, along with the Licensee\u2019s Appeal Rights (LIC 9058 01/16) was provided to the Licensee.",

The purpose of the inspection was to follow up on the facility buildings and grounds. On 9/12/23 the Department received a law enforcement contact report dated 9/10/23. The report stated that a vehicle drove through the facility backyard fence, damaging the fence and a pool. On 9/21/23, LPA Larios conducted an unannounced inspection at the facility and observed the backyard fence in disrepair. Pieces of wood from the fence were observed on the floor and a gap in the fence was uncovered, permitting access to the facility. The facility informed LPA Larios that they were not permitted to fix the fence due to an ongoing law enforcement investigation. On 9/28/23, LPA Larios visited the law enforcement agency who responded to the incident and was informed a report was unavailable due to the ongoing investigation. Law enforcement stated the responding officers should not have advised the facility to leave the fence in disrepair and in addition, informed LPA Larios the facility can repair the fence. On 9/28/23, LPA Larios conducted a follow up visit to the facility and observed the fence has since been repaired and in good condition. Due to the repair of the fence no further follow-up is required. Exit interview conducted. A copy of this report was given to the above-mentioned facility representative. No deficiencies were cited.",

S1 also monitored C1 to make sure she did not continue to hurt herself while waiting for the EMT. Once EMT arrived, C1 was given first aid to stop the bleeding and was later taken to the hospital.

The referral reported staff (S1) allegedly raped a former client, who is now an adult (A1). S1 denied the allegation. However, S1 confirmed A1 spent the night at his home and slept on his bed on 9/12/23. The investigation revealed S1 did not follow the facility\u2019s polices and procedures by fraternizing with A1 while she was placed in the facility via text message using his personal cellular phone. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with facility staff consistently indicated staff are trained to not engage in behavior that may be deemed inappropriate, such as giving clients their personal cellular phone number. Per interviews conducted with staff, staff are reminded of the policy during bi-weekly meetings. Based on S1 admitting he was inappropriate by providing his contact information to A1 while she was a client at the facility and maintained contact with her by calling, texting, and seeing her outside of the facility, all of which was against the facility policy, which he confirmed he was aware of as evidenced by his signed acknowledgement, the allegation is Substantiated. The facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards, Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Article 6, standard 87072(c)(15) Personal Rights. S1 violated A1\u2019s personal rights by failing to maintain a formal staff/client relationship by fraternizing with A1 while she was a youth placed at the facility. A copy of this report, LIC809D, LIC811 were given to the above mentioned facility representative. Appeals rights were provided. Per the new Civil Penalty laws, Health and Safety (H&S) Code section 1548(E), an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) determination is pending due to the substantiated allegation. If an ECP is warranted, a Community Care Licensing (CCL) representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment.",

The Administrator stated that the staff tried to keep Ref. #1 and #2 separated. The LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Allegation - Staff do not prevent a minor from having access to marijuana. Interviews with the Administrator Fletcher revealed that Ref. #2 smoked in the bedroom at the facility. The Administrator revealed that initially the facility did not have approval to search Ref. #2 when Ref. #2 returned from outside activities, but received approval from the County Social Worker. Once the approval was received Ref. #2 was searched for contraband. The Administrator stated that the situation was referred to mental health services. There was no preponderance of the evidence to substantiate the allegations. So, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

C1 then went to the office, sat down, and spoke to S3. S2 then entered the office and prompts C1 to clean up the mess he/she made in the kitchen. C1 refused and started cussing.

    "narrative": "LPA conducted an investigation into the aforementioned allegations. This investigation included, but was not limited to, a thorough review of various records, such as the client\u2019s needs and service plans, medical records, SIR\u2019s and the police report. Additionally, interviews were conducted with three staff members: S1 on 3/6/25, S2 on 3/12/25, and S3 on 4/17/25. Furthermore, two out of four clients were interviewed: C3 on 4/17/25 and C4 on 3/12/25. An interview was also held with one San Bernardino County Social Worker (CSW3) on 4/23/25. It is important to note that no statements were obtained from C1 or C2, as they chose not to provide one. (Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated June 19, 2025). [The following allegations were reported.] 1. The staff did not provide adequate supervision, resulting in minor AWOLing and engaging in drug use. The staff members (S1, S2, S3) denied the allegations, asserting that the safety of their clients is their utmost priority and that they would never compromise their safety. The staff noted that the facility has between one to three staff members present, depending on the facility's requirements, while adhering to the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards, which stipulate a staff-to-client ratio of 1:4. Additionally, on the day of the alleged incident, February 24, 2025, staff received a call from the school requesting the pickup of clients C1 and C2 due to their cutting class and being caught using a wax pen behind the school. Upon their return from school, C1 and C2 expressed a desire to play basketball in the backyard under the supervision of S3. S3 reported that C1 and C2 hit the ball over the backyard fence and permitted C1 to retrieve it; however, both clients jumped the fence and began to walk away from the STRTP. S3 promptly followed them in the company vehicle and attempted to verbally redirect them to return to the vehicle and go back to the STRTP, but these efforts were unsuccessful. S3 stated that they pursued the clients until they lost sight of them as they ran through fields, neighboring backyards, and crossed a pedestrian bridge. S3 informed S1 that they had lost sight of the clients and quickly contacted local law enforcement to file a missing person\u2019s report for both clients. Continued....\n\nS1 and S3 reported that the clients eventually returned to the STRTP on their own, declined any medical attention, and underwent a visual inspection for contraband, which yielded no findings on either C1 or C2. S1 then reached out to law enforcement to notify them of the clients' return to the STRTP. Later that day, a peace officer visited the STRTP to check on and speak with C1 and C2 before leaving shortly thereafter. 2. The staff did not report minors' elopement in a timely manner. The Staff (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the allegation, asserting that all incidents are reported without delay to all relevant agencies. S1 additionally noted that the incident that took place on February 24, 2025, involving C1 and C2 going AWOL was not reported immediately because S3 had visual contact with C1 and C2. Once S3 lost sight of C1 and C2, S1 instructed S3 to search the familiar areas where clients typically go AWOL; however, S3 was unable to find the clients, leading to a missing person\u2019s report being submitted to the local law enforcement. S1 emphasized that once a staff member loses sight of said client, staff will adhere to protocol and the Needs and Services of the respective client. S1 mentioned that staff will allow thirty minutes for the client to return before alerting local Law Enforcement. Furthermore, confidential statements acquired from clients C3 and C4 contradicted the allegations, affirming that the facility staff is consistently present and that clients are regularly monitored by the staff. C3 and C4 expressed that they felt secure living at the facility and appreciated the involvement of the facility staff with the clients. Information gathered from CSW3 indicated that they have no issues concerning the care and supervision provided to their clients and that staff would always promptly notify them of any incidents through email or text. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore, the allegation(s) are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the STRTP Administrator. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Administrator.",

LPA toured the facility with the Administrator (AD) and observed that all smoke detectors were installed and in working order on 06/18/25. When speaking with AD the smoke detectors were not removed from the facility but taken down to change the battery and put back up by staff the same day. LPA also observed that one lock on a client bedroom door was reversed and on the outside of the bedroom. AD stated that a previous client had a history of AWOL and stated the door had the lock on the outside to ensure safety of the client and was not for the purpose of locking the client inside the bedroom. Client is no longer at the facility; LPA requested the facility to place the lock back on the proper side. During the visit the AD placed the lock to its original side, inside the bedroom. (See Confidential Names LIC 811 dated July 1st, 2025). Due to the inconsistency of information obtained during the investigation, it cannot be determined whether the above allegations occurred.",

The purpose of the inspection is to follow up on a Special Incident Report (SIR) received by the Department on 09/11/24. The incident indicated that staff S1 grabbed client C1\u2019s arms from behind in an attempt to remove a pencil that may be used as a weapon, which resulted to C1 falling and sustaining a nosebleed (refer to Confidential Names List LIC811 dated 10/02/24). LPA Silva reviewed the SIR and a video recording, and conducted telephone interviews with two (2) staff members on 09/12/24 and 09/13/24. The incident started when C1 got upset when the wi-fi was turned off at 12PM, in accordance with facility house rules. C1 became agitated and started to throw things and was threatening to stab staff with a colored pencil. As C1 turned her back from S1 and was walking away, S1 grabbed both arms behind C1\u2019s back in an attempt, to take the colored pencil from C1. S1 then tried to take C1 down on the couch while still holding C1\u2019s arms behind him/her. C1 fell on the couch face first, which resulted to C1 sustaining a nosebleed. S1 was able to remove the pencil from C1 after she fell. According to S1, he removed the pencil from C1 to prevent C1 from harming or stabbing herself and another staff S2. S2 stated that she did not witness the incident from when S1 took C1 to the couch to C1 falling on the couch. C1 was given an ice pack for the nosebleed. C1 was offered further medical attention but C1 refused. Staff monitored C1\u2019s nosebleed. Based on the information gathered from confidential interviews and records reviewed, a deficiency citation on STRTP Interim Licensing Standards, Personal Rights Section 87072(c )(32) is being issued (see LIC809D).

Therefore, the above allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. Regarding the allegation that staff handled minor in a rough manner: During the course of the investigation, LPA Karkazis conducted confidential interviews, document research, and facility video surveillance review. During confidential interviews with staff and clients, a youth stated staff have never handled her in a rough manner. All staff interviewed stated they use de-escalation techniques, redirection, and restraints as last resort. Staff stated that the youth pulled staff\u2019s hair, and pulled staff on top of the youth, and could not get off of her until the youth let go of staff\u2019s hair. Once the youth let go, staff immediately got off of the youth. LPA viewed video surveillance and witnessed staff using de-escalation, redirection, and proper restraint holds, ensuring client and staff safety. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that staff handled minor in a rough manner. Therefore, the above allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. Regarding the allegation that medical attention was refused to a minor in care: LPA Karkazis conducted confidential interviews and document research. During confidential interviews with staff and clients, the youth stated that she has never been denied medical attention during the incident or any other time while residing at this facility. Staff stated that during the incident, the youth was combative and destructive in the presence of law enforcement. Law enforcement tried to determine if the youth needed a psychiatric evaluation. Staff stated to law enforcement that the youth\u2019s behavior is normal, and will return to baseline behavior, in which she did. Staff told law enforcement that a psychiatric evaluation was not necessary. During document research, LPA found that there was no evidence of injury, no need for medical attention, and no medical attention refused. However, the youth did not speak directly to law enforcement to refuse psychiatric attention, meaning the staff statements to law enforcement could be perceived as speaking on behalf of the youth. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that medical attention was refused to a minor in care.

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that S1 used inappropriate language toward C1, confidential interviews and record review revealed that on the morning of May 8, 2021, C1 was being disruptive and disturbing the other clients in the STRTP after staff had told C1 to stop. C1 then walked out of the facility without permission and began to play basketball. Confidential interviews revealed that S1 went outside after C1 and verbally redirected C1 to get back inside the STRTP. Furthermore, all confidential interviews revealed S1 does not cuss and S1 was not heard using inappropriate or foul language towards C1 during this occurrence. Confidential interviews revealed S1 said to C1 to go back into the STRTP and that S1 was not trying to argue with C1. Additionally, confidential interviews revealed C1 was the one who cussed and used foul language towards S1. Regarding the allegation that S1 hit C1, one confidential interview revealed during the incident noted above, while S1 and C1 were outside, S1 snatched a basketball out of C1\u2019s hand and while grabbing the ball S1 scratched C1\u2019s arm. This interview revealed C1 had a swollen scratch that lasted about 30 minutes however no other interviews revealed any scratch or mark was seen on C1. S1 denied the need to grab the ball out of C1\u2019s hand and denied S1 scratched or accidentally hit C1. A confidential witness interview revealed S1 did not scratch or hit C1 and only grabbed the basketball out of C1\u2019s hands. Furthermore, an interview with CSW revealed CSW had no concerns of the STRTP and that C1 has not disclosed any issues to CSW regarding S1 or any other staff. Additionally, CSW disclosed that C1 has made allegations in the past and then has stated those allegations did not happen. Based on confidential interviews and conflicting statements of what occurred, the allegations that S1 used inappropriate language toward C1 and S1 hit C1, may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were explained and given to Facility Manager Cedrick Reliford.",

On November 22, 2022, the Department concluded a complaint investigation. The complaint alleged that the nine-year-old child #1 (C1) suffered sexual assault while residing in the STRTP. The allegation of staff failure to properly supervise the children was determined substantiated, and the STRTP was cited from the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80078 (a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. An immediate civil penalty of $500.00 was assessed. See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated January 9, 2023. Based on the consistent investigative interviews gathered, the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for the STRTP staff failing to provide care and supervision for C1, resulting with sexual assault. The Penal Code section 11165.2 defines general neglect as the negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child, including acts or omissions, by a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare under circumstances indicating harm or threatened harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health & Safety Code section 1548 (f)(1)(E), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,000.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights discussed.

C1 walked outside to the front of the facility. Two staff were in the kitchen supervising the clients. The incident happened so fast that the staff were unable to prevent it. C1 sustained a small mark, the size of pencil lead, under C1's right eye. The staff provided ice to C1. It was further reported C1 and C2 got along like brothers. Sometimes they got along and there were no incidents. Other times, both clients instigated arguments with each other and sometimes hit each other. The LPA received consistent information the staff intervened when the clients fought with each other. The staff always asked the clients to stop and separated the clients. The clients were very young and were always messing with each other or trying to get each other in trouble. The staff constantly had to redirect the clients. The LPA received consistent information the clients were never left unsupervised and there were two to four staff working when the clients were present at the facility. The LPA did not receive any evidence to support the staff did not prevent altercations between the clients. However, other confidential information was received indicating C2 beat up C1 six to 12 times and sometimes the staff did nothing. The staff told C1 to go back inside the facility, while C2 was allowed to continue playing. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations C1 sustained bruises on C1's cheek, underneath C1's eye and a scratch under C1's eye from another client and C1 gets beats up every other day by the client may have happened or are valid, however there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to Betty Winfree.",

The incident involved an allegation of assault regarding C2 being assaulted by C1. This incident was not reported to the County Social Worker (CSW) or Child Protective Services (CPS), or specifically reported to CCL in a timely manner. Likewise, the incident report that was submitted to CCL, did not accurately report the nature or details of the incident.

According to facility records, the serious incident report (SIR) dated 10/16/2020 indicates the SIR was sent to the CSW. The CSW denied receipt of the SIR.

It was unknown if the bowl was thrown at C1 or just the contents of the cereal and milk. During the investigation, confidential interviews denied witnessing S1 throwing a bowl of cereal at C1. Other confidential interviews reported that C1 got mad and threw C1\u2019s slipper at S1 and hit S1 on the mouth; the interviews said, S1 jumped and S1\u2019s cereal contents fell over C1. A confidential interview maintained that S1 threw the bowl of cereal at C1, however, C1 was unable to demonstrate how it happened. One confidential interview stated that the cereal bowl was not thrown at C1. The same interview added that the cereal contents landed on C1 because S1 jumped when the slipper was thrown at S1\u2019s bottom lip. In regard to the allegation that staff called minor an inappropriate name, it was indicated that C1 threw C1\u2019s shoe at S1 and S1 called C1 a \u201cbitch.\u201d A confidential interview reported not hearing S1 calling C1 a \u201cbitch.\u201d Another interview reported that S1 calls C1 a \u201cbitch\u201d sometimes. Another confidential interview stated S1 called C1 a \u201cbitch\u201d because C1 threw C1\u2019s shoe at S1. Other confidential interviews reported not witnessing S1 use inappropriate names toward clients in care. One interview indicated that the word \u201cbitch\u201d was not said to C1 nor used at the STRTP.

Confidential interviews revealed C1 ran out of C1\u2019s medication and was not given C1\u2019s medication for approximately one month; while other interviews revealed C1 was out of medication for a few days. Record review revealed C1 ran out of psychotropic medication and took C1\u2019s last dose on 7/9/2021 and did not receive his prescribed medication from 7/10/2021 through 7/21/2021. Interviews with staff revealed they were aware that C1 was low on medication however believed it would still be the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) team\u2019s responsibility to obtain C1\u2019s refill. Other confidential interviews revealed that the STRTP staff was told C1 could be seen by an outside psychiatrist to obtain a refill however the STRTP did not schedule an appointment for C1 to be seen. Interviews and record review revealed that in a meeting held on 7/14/2021 it was determined C1\u2019s WRAP services would be terminated, however, the WRAP team was able to schedule an emergency appointment on 7/15/2021 for C1 to be seen by a psychiatrist and obtain a prescription refill on C1\u2019s medication. Interviews revealed the STRTP obtained the medication refill on 7/19/2021 however record review revealed C1 was not given C1\u2019s medication for the remainder of C1\u2019s placement in the STRTP. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The department has determined the allegation that staff did not ensure C1 received medication is substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of the Title 22 General Regulations Division 6 Chapter 1, Section 80075 (a) Health Related Services. Per confidential interviews and record review facility staff did not ensure C1 was provided medical services to obtain a refill on medications which resulted in C1 not receiving their psychotropic medications which poses an immediate health, safety or personal rights risk to clients in care. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights was provided to Senior Facility Manager Cedric Reliford.\n\nConfidential interviews and record review revealed that on 7/20/2021, C2 and C3 believed C1 went through their belongings so C2 and C3 went into C1\u2019s bedroom, C2 threw a sandal at C1, hitting C1 in the head and C3 slapped C1 in the face, causing C1 to get a bloody nose. Other confidential interviews revealed C2 and C3 slapped and punched C1 several times. Confidential Interviews and record review revealed staff did not observe the assault on C1, however there were two staff, S1 and S2 on duty and present in the facility at the time of the incident. Confidential interviews revealed after the incident occurred, S1 offered C1 medical attention and S1 had C1 sleep in the living room for the remainder of the night. All confidential interviews revealed that there are usually two staff on shift except during overnight shift and that staff check on clients every 15 minutes. It was also reported that this incident occurred within 5-10 minutes of S1, C2 and C3 returning to the STRTP. The interview with CSW revealed there were no concerns of supervision in the STRTP. Based on confidential interviews and record review, C1 was physically assaulted by C2 and C3 while in care, however, it is not supported or proven by evidence that it occurred due to lack of supervision. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were explained and given to Senior Facility Manager Cedric Reliford.",

The other clients who managed to go inside the bedroom reported wanting to de-escalate the situation which C1 denied. The other clients confirmed that S1 closed the door and told the clients to \u201chandle it.\u201d C1 reported being attacked by the other clients so C1 acted in self-defense against C2 and the other clients. S1 initially denied closing the door but admitted to doing so after further questioning by Investigator Williams. S1 reported not realizing the situation could get out of control like it did and that the clients were only supposed to talk. The other staff (S2) reported being on the phone downstairs while S1 handled the incident upstairs. When S2 went upstairs, S1 was directing all the clients to go back to their bedrooms and C2 reported being stabbed by C1. S2 does not recall what S1 did or say during the incident. S2 admitted not giving any verbal redirection to clients to de-escalate the incident because S2 \u201cwas in shock.\u201d The incident resulted a law enforcement response to the facility. C2 was observed by law enforcement with seven punctures to the right hand, seven punctures to the right wrist, a scratch to the right forearm and a scratch to the right collarbone area. C1 sustained a bruise on the left eyebrow area and pain to the neck. Law enforcement recovered a hair pick on facility property which was identified as the weapon used to stab C2. It was described as eight inches in length with eleven metal prongs approximately six inches long with a two-inch handle. C1 was detained at the conclusion of law enforcement\u2019s response. Based on information obtained and records reviewed, there is a preponderance of evidence found to support a substantiated finding of neglect/lack of supervision that staff allowed clients to engage in physical altercation resulting in clients sustaining serious injuries.

In an interview conducted, the county investigator stated that they did not have any immediate concerns about the client's safety in the home and that it appeared the situation in the home between the client and staff had stabilized. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to suggest that the allegation occurred. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegation is deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "On March 15, 2024 at 10:00 AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Juliet Robles conducted an unannounced case management inspection at the above facility and met with the Facility Manager, Jessie Galloway. The purpose of the inspection is to follow up on two (2) Special Incident Reports (SIR) received late by the Department on 02/05/24. The two (2) incidents indicated that three (3) clients engaged in physical altercation resulting in minor injuries, a client taken to Juvenile Hall and found to possess a handmade weapon (refer to Confidential Names List LIC 811 dated 03/15/24). LPA conducted a review of the staffs training, LIC 500, staff\u2019s schedule and facility\u2019s restraints and special treatment plan. LPA conducted interviews via telephone call on 03/14/24 with County Social Worker (CSW), Staff 1 (S1) and Administrator. Per CSW, she was aware of the incident that occurred simultaneously on those days. She stated that C1 has issues with rage, he has a difficult time if he does not get his way, it will completely put him on edge. Per CSW, the facility has great communication with C1. It is a struggle, but the facility talks to C1, addresses it immediately with the Therapist. Per CSW, a Child Family Team Meeting (CFT) was held on 03/06/24 with C1 present. According to Administrator, the therapist after investigating, found out that the root of all the bickering, verbal arguments that lead to physical altercation is that one client borrowed money from one of the clients to buy a vape pen. So, the treatment plan for these clients at the facility per Administrator, with the Social Worker\u2019s approval, the clients are not physically receiving their allowance. It will be the staff who will get the allowance for each of the clients and go with them and buy what they need, to avoid buying drugs, substance abuse. With regards to the handmade weapon, per Administrator, the client picked up that broken chair leg from the trash and hid it. The client made threats to the LE that led to the search and found the handmade weapon.\n\nOn February 05, 2024, the facility submitted to the Department SIRs or LIC 624 LE dated 01/27/24 and 01/28/24 involving incidents of client\u2019s physical altercation resulting to minor injuries, LE involvement, client taken to Juvenile Hall for possession of a handmade weapon that were not received by the Department within 24 hours or the next business day following the occurrence of the incident. Therefore, a citation is merited for Title 22 Division 6 Chapter 1 Article 6, 80061 Reporting Requirements, see LIC 809D. Exit interview conducted. A copy of this report, LIC809, LIC809C, LIC809D, LIC 811 and appeal rights were provided to the facility manager.",

On April 16, 2024, the Department received a complaint alleging a Blissful Living Group Home, Inc. (BLGHI) staff (S1) (Reference Confidential Names form LIC811 dated 11/4/24) sexually abused a client in care. The allegation was substantiated, and the facility was cited on September 9, 2024, for violation of Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 87072(c)(1) Personal Rights. S1 admitted to transporting two clients to a strip club on April 14, 2024. Upon arrival, both minors were denied entry into the club. S1 then invited both clients to her home. A client alleged that while at her home, S1 sexually abused him by kissing him on the lips and fondling his genitals over his clothing. The client provided consistent statements regarding the incident during interviews conducted by multiple agencies. S1 denied the allegation. However, record reviewed revealed law enforcement arrested S1 on April 15, 2024, for sexual battery by restraint and touching a person intimately against their will for sexual arousal.

    "narrative": "It was stated that the facility provides childcare to clients that attend school, work or have emergency situations. It was stated that no childcare is provided for clients after 10pm daily at the facility. During the investigation LPA Rogers learned from written reports that C1 left the facility after 10pm. It was reported that during her absence from the facility, C1 left her minor child unattended in the facility. C1 did not return to the facility until 5:30 am the next morning to minor child crying. It was at that time staff informed C1 the minor child was left unattended and crying for hours at the facility. It was reported to LPA during interviews that C1 was never denied childcare but that C1 only prefers specific staff to care for her child during her absence which limits the availability for childcare. Community Care Licensing also received an allegation that a minor is not being provided safe and comfortable accommodations while in care. It was alleged that staff told C1 to leave minor child unattended laying on facility couch. It was also alleged that C1 minor child developed diaper rash due to facility staff not being attentive to minors needs. It was reported during interviews that C1 leaves the minor child unattended in a swing during the night. It was also reported that facility staff has had several conversations with C1 regarding it not being safe nor comfortable leaving the minor child in the swing unattended for hours. It was stated that each time there is a conversation regarding C1 behaviors, C1 will become loud and argumentative with staff and accuse staff of complaining. It was also reported that there have been no complaints or requests for medical attention for minor children with diaper rash in the facility. During her absence away from the facility the minor child was not fed nor was the minor child\u2019s diaper changed or needs attended to. There were never any complaints regarding a minor developing a diaper rash or a minor\u2019s diaper not being changed due to childcare staff not being attentive to the child\u2019s needs.

    "narrative": "On March 24, 2023, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Leslie Covarrubias arrived unannounced and met with Born For Nia (STRTP) Executive Assistant Vanessa Maddox to discuss a personal rights violation revealed through interviews and record review during an investigation regarding client 1 (C1) expectant parent payment check for $2,700.00 that was addressed to C1 being opened by the staff. LPA obtained pertinent documents, such as copies of the original check sent to C1, written in C1\u2019s name, and the cashier\u2019s check from the facility/corporate bank account to C1. Record review and confidential interviews corroborated that $2,700 was returned to C1 as a cashier\u2019s check from the facility/corporate bank account once the facility realized they opened C1 mail and cashed C1 check for $2,700. No court order was found in C1\u2019s file regarding C1 receiving opened mail. Based on the preponderance of the evidence, the facility violated the client\u2019s personal rights by opening C1 mail addressed to C1. The facility did not provide unopened mail to C1, and no court order was found in C1\u2019s file. Therefore, the facility is being cited for Interim Licensing Standards Short Term Therapeutic Version 4, 87072 Personal Rights (c)(9) To have access to letter writing material and to send and receive unopened mail unless prohibited by court order. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were explained and given to Executive Assistant Vanessa Maddox.",

Confidential interviews and record review provided conflicting accounts of how supervision is handled in the facility. Confidential interviews report room checks are usually done every thirty minutes. Conflicting confidential interviews reported that staff was often in the staff office or watching TV and would only occasionally check on residents. Record review revealed room checks were mostly done every thirty minutes however, there were dates of missing entries and therefore thirty-minute room checks could not be verified. CCL received an allegation alleging staff do not assist minor with obtaining medical care. Confidential interviews provided conflicting statements as to who assists minors with obtaining medical care. Confidential interviews reported regarding minors, the house manager would make the appointment and any follow-up appointments were to be scheduled by the minors. Additional confidential interviews reported minors made their own appointments and staff would assist with transportation if the minors had put the appointment on the calendar and staff was available to assist. Confidential interview could not confirm, or dispute staff do not assist minor with obtaining medical care. CCL also received an allegation alleging facility does not meet infants diapering needs. Specifically, it was reported that C1\u2019s baby always gets diaper rashes. Confidential interviews and record review revealed C1\u2019s baby was not placed in the facility as a resident but was residing in the facility as C1\u2019s child, therefore care and supervision of C1\u2019s baby was primarily the responsibility of C1, and the facility would assist C1.

Conflicting confidential interviews reported C1\u2019s baby was often observed with a soiled diaper and redness on their bottom. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute C1\u2019s baby having a diaper rash was due to the facility not changing C1\u2019s baby as needed.

Confidential interviews reported nighttime staff have facility responsibilities such as logging room checks every half hour, laundry, and other facility cleaning. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute witnessing facility staff sleeping. Record review revealed room checks were mostly done every thirty minutes however, there were dates of missing entries and therefore thirty-minute room checks could not be verified.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews reported that there were not enough food supplies in the home for clients (C1-C4) to make meals for themselves for several months. Confidential interviews also reported that the facility sometimes had expired milk in the refrigerator. Other confidential interviews reported that the facility staff went grocery shopping twice a month and that all groceries were re-supplied when the facility ran low. Confidential interviews reported that overnight staff was responsible for taking inventory of the facility\u2019s food supply and reporting needed items to the Administrator. Other confidential interviews reported that there was always plenty of food for clients to make their own meals and that, at other times, staff prepared meals for the clients. Confidential interviews reported that one of the facility\u2019s program goals was to teach clients how to prepare meals independently. Confidential interviews reported that sometimes, clients would complain there weren\u2019t enough groceries when they didn\u2019t want to cook for themselves. Confidential interviews reported that when clients complained about a food shortage, the facility staff showed them the food supply of refrigerated and dry foods. During the health and safety inspection on 10/17/2023, LPA observed perishable and non-perishable food. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegation that staff (S1-S4) do not ensure the required supply of foods is maintained in the home, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were explained and given to Executive Assistant Vanessa Maddox.",

Confidential interviews revealed that S1 called S2 to inform of the incident while all clients were getting into the facility vehicle, and C1 was raising C1\u2019s voice towards staff because S1 stated C1 was cussing at S1. Confidential interviews revealed that as all clients were being transported to C2\u2019s appointment, C2 got brought up in a conversation, and C1 and C2 started yelling at each other. Additional confidential interviews revealed that S1 told C1 and C2 not to yell and used the music as a de-escalation technique. Once C1 and C2 started fighting in the moving vehicle, S1 pulled over immediately. Confidential interviews also revealed that C1 and C2 did not get along and had a history of verbal arguments; however, they never had any physical altercations. Confidential interviews revealed when S1 pulled over, S1 tried to separate C1 and C2, and C4 also assisted by getting out of the car and opening the car door. Confidential interviews revealed that S1 reminded both C1 and C2 of the dangers of fighting while pregnant. There are corroborated statements that S1 attempted to intervene when C1 and C2 engaged in a physical altercation by pulling the moving vehicle over to park the car and S1 getting out of the car to separate the clients. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegation that staff (S1) did not intervene when clients (C1-C2) engaged in a physical altercation is unsubstantiated.

The video reviewed by LPA confirmed this information. Additionally, corroborating statements obtained by LPA, and review of previous SIRs, confirm S1 has a history of this behavior with GH clients. Based on confidential interviews and information gathered, the allegations that S1 spoke inappropriately to C1, and S1 engaged in a verbal altercation with C1, are SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The GH is being cited under section 84072(d)(10): Personal Rights. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were emailed to Ms. Vanessa for signature. Original signed report will be placed in facility file.\n\nwitness statements confirm that the GH had bed bugs, however, most statements corroborate that since the home was treated, the bed bugs had disappeared. LPA received conflicting statement that there were still bed bugs in the home. Confidential interviews state that they did not take pictures, however, but found bed bugs in the bed and box spring even after the GH was treated. All parties corroborate that the concern for bed bugs stopped once C1\u2019s mattress and box spring were replaced around date of allegation. Other confidential statements confirm there were no problems with bed bugs after the GH was initially treated for pests on 05/06/20, 05/28/20, and 06/05/20. Based on interviews conducted, the allegation that the group home has an infestation of bed bugs, may have occurred, however, it is not supported or proven by evidence. The allegation is, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were emailed to Ms. Vanessa for original signature. Original signed reports will be placed in facility file.",

It was disclosed during confidential interviews that C1 would be given a community pass, leave the facility with no adult supervision and would not return to the facility before curfew. It was reported that there were no consequences given to clients when AWOLing from the facility. It was explained to LPA Rogers that community passes from the facility were for all day with a curfew time of 10:00 pm. It was also reported during interviews that clients were allowed 20 \u2013 30 minute walks 2 times per day from the facility. These walks would give opportunities for clients to leave and not return to the facility. LPA Rogers learned during confidential interviews that because of low staffing clients are encouraged to take a day pass or be transported to the Moreno Valley facility during the hours of 4:00 pm and 10:00 pm, which also contributed to clients AWOLing from the facility. It was reported that community passes are privileges given to clients by their CSW. It was also reported that an AWOLed client is not reported until 2 hours past reporting time. It was also reported that staff would try to verbally deter, counsel and inform clients of the consequences of AWOLing from the facility.

According to confidential interviews, Staff # 1 (S1) left C1\u2019s baby (IN1) inside a car seat with a soiled diaper for more than two hours on at least one occasion. According to confidential interviews, S1 was indifferent when confronted about it by one of the other clients. Confidential interviews also corroborated allegation that S1 would encourage clients to fight, and that S1 tried to coerce C1 and C2 into fighting Child #4 (C4). Based on interviews and information gathered during the investigation, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined the allegations that Staff # 1 (S1) encouraged minors to fight and did not meet Infant\u2019s (IN1) needs while in care, as a result of IN1 being left in a car seat with soiled diaper for extended period of time is substantiated. The facility is issued a citation for the staff's actions, which posed an immediate and potential health and safety or personal rights risk to the children placed in care. These actions are in violation of the Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5 Version 4, Sections 87078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and 87072(c)(11) Personal Rights. See attached LIC 9099D for cited deficiencies.

LPAs obtained conflicting information during interviews. Confidential interviews denied that staff # 1 (S1) was paying minors to change diapers, as well as did not ensure that Child # 2 (C2) attended school. According to confidential interviews, S1 always encouraged C2 and other children to attend school. Confidential interviews also denied that S1 and other facility staff was not logging in diaper changes, and stated that whenever a client has their diaper changed or has a bowel movement it is always logged in. LPA Mena was shown examples of diaper changing logs. While other confidential information received by Licensing Office stated that these allegations had occurred. There were no other known witnesses to these allegations. Based on interviews and confidential information obtained during the course of this investigation, the allegations that Staff # 1 (S1) did not ensure that a minor attended school, is paying minors to change diapers while in care and that facility has inadequate record keeping, more specifically that S1 was not logging in infant\u2019s diaper changes, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence.

Medical records reviewed for C1 confirmed C1 tested positive for \u201cBenzodiazepines\u201d and \u201cCannabinoids/THC\u201d. In addition, C1 experienced respiratory failure requiring \u201cEndotracheal intubation\u201d. As a result, C1 was placed on mechanical ventilation. Interviews revealed Client #2 (C2) also consumed Xanax pills with C1 on July 27, 2021, also requiring emergency hospitalization. Statements were obtained admitting to clients obtaining and consumption of illegal drugs while in the facility. Interviews further revealed that facility staff commonly perform room searches and conduct room checks; however, the frequency of room searches and room checks are inconsistent. Based on confidential interviews and medical reports, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The Department has determined substantiated findings that residents obtained and consumed illegal drugs while at the facility that resulted in their hospitalization. This poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk to children in care. The facility is issued a citation per the California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 06 80078 (a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision.

Statements by staff and documentary evidence revealed C1 was taken to the hospital, however, confidential interviews revealed doctor's notes stated that there were no bruises, swelling, cuts, or lacerations on C1.

LPA Portillo conducted interviews with staff and obtained information indicating the facility emailed information on CDC guidelines and always reinforced the importance of washing hands. The facility\u2019s LVN and Human Resources, shared resources when requested on COVID-19 inquiries. Interviews revealed that emails were sometimes sent out to all staff to notify them of new COVID-19 cases and to follow proper protocol when cottages were in isolation. The interviews also indicated that contact tracing was not always conducted to prescreen the possibility of a staff/client being exposed to COVID-19. Interviews with staff indicated that under the HIPPA law, names had to remain confidential but through word of mouth, staff and clients would know who was positive for COVID. Interviews mentioned masks were not always worn by staff and clients. Interviews showed since the clients live in the same cottage, the gathering was viewed as a gathering with family members. Interviews also revealed, COVID-19 testing was done, and options were offered to obtain testing that was covered by their insurance or the employer. Some staff did not wear masks on campus and due to the lack of compliance, staff were written up for not following agency\u2019s policy. The agency would sometimes provide sanitary supplies such as soap, but staff would have to purchase soap for staff and clients. The supply of soap was low due to constant hand washing but soap always available. Interviews indicated that disinfecting was done by staff and clients and at times vendors came on site to assist with disinfecting the facilty due to a high volume of COVID cases. A full-time staff was hired to disinfect the facilty. A Pandemic Outbreak Disaster Plan indicated that staff should wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect the cottages.

The SIR indicated that on 06/02/24 at around 8:00 PM, client (C1) was in the living room watching TV and being supervised by staff (S1). C1 asked S1 to move from his seat so that he can lay down on the couch. S1 told C1 he could move to a different seat because he was sitting there at the time. C1 then laid on the couch and started putting his feet on S1's laptop which was placed on his lap. S1 continued to counsel C1 to stop. The third time that C1 put his foot on the laptop, S1 kicked his left leg to prevent him from putting his leg on the laptop. C1 reported the incident to S2 who was in the kitchen at the time cleaning after dinner. S2 checked C1's leg and noticed slight redness but no swelling or noticeable injuries. S1 was sent home for the evening by his supervisor and another staff came to work overnight. C1 was assessed and no medical attention needed. C1 also refused any medical attention. LPA conducted interviews and gathered the following information: S1 just lifted his leg to block C1 from putting his foot down on his laptop and denied kicking C1. C1 confirmed the incident while C2 who was watching TV at the time refused to talk. S2 only heard C1 asking S1 to move to another couch and did not hear S1's response. She did not hear any loud noise coming from the living room while she was in the kitchen. LPA also gathered information that both clients did not like the report that S1 made previously regarding their behavior.

S4 disclosed initially, that it was reported by another staff that she returned the phone to the Program Office (PO) that same day, however, circumstances surrounding the event could no longer be verified that the phone was returned to the PO after the client obtained his contact number. The staff who picked up the phone for the client on 11/16/2023 stated that at first, she believed she returned the phone to the PO, but after speaking with another worker at the PO, she now believes that she left the phone on the counter at the cottage and that is when the phone was reportedly went missing. Staff interviews provided consistent information that the phone went missing and they attempted to locate the phone, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Other confidential interviews with the focused client corroborated the incident and its timeline when his phone was determined lost/missing after he requested to access his cellular phone on or about 11/22/23 (second time). The focused client disclosed that the facility has offered to replace his cellular phone but has declined the offer at this time.

The Facility Supervisor (FS) denied the allegation and stated that Marijuana and other types of contraband are not permitted. FS disclosed that all staff workers at the facility don\u2019t allow clients to have any smoking products, including vape pens. FS disclosed that they had one incident on 06/21/2024 that involved a client, and the age of the client appears to match the report that involved Marijuana vape pens. FS disclosed that the contraband was confiscated, and a Special Incident Report dated 06/21/2024 was submitted to the appropriate county and state agencies for review. In confidential interviews with clients, and staff working at the facility provided consistent statements and denied the allegation that the staff does not prevent clients from having access to Marijuana and other contraband. One individual identified as \u201cother\u201d in the report could not be located/contacted therefore no statement was obtained. Based on the information gathered during interviews and documentary evidence, it cannot be determined whether the allegation occurred that staff working at the facility do not prevent client(s) from having access to Marijuana and other types of contraband. Therefore, the above allegation is determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the facility representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided after the inspection.
