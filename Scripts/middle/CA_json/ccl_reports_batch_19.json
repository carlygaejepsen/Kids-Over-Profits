(Continue on LIC809-C)\n\n(Continue from LIC809) The alleged sexual assault was not at the facility; therefore, staff were unable to prevent harm done to the minor. The agency developed an individual safety plan for C1 due to this incident. The agency has acted by providing additional support, increased supervision, and CFT meeting. There appears to be no negligence on behalf of the staff. Once staff knew the minor was no feeling well, wasn\u2019t answering questions when being asked, they immediately called the case manager and 911 to take C1 to the hospital. Cheryl Rouse agreed to update LPA Tran with any ongoing developments regarding this matter. No citation was given for this visit. A copy of this report was emailed to Cheryl Rouse for review and signature. (end of interview)",

    "narrative": "The finding for the allegation, \u201cfacility staff did not provide a clean environment for youth\u201d is Substantiated. The evidence for the allegation: \u201cfacility staff did not provide a clean environment for youth\u201d as follows; On May 28, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed S1. S1 told this LPA, the protocol for something like a maintenance issue is for the Case Manager to tell the THPP Program Manager (S2) who then would notify S1. S1 would approve or disapprove of the work being done. If approved, there will be a work order and she (S1) would follow-up with the resident to make sure it was taken care of. On June 1, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed S2. Per S2, no concerns were brought to her attention by residents of the home not being clean. On May 28, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed C1. Per C1, the garage was full of things and was dirty. C1 said that the house chores were done by her and the other residents and that the house needs to be professionally cleaned, due to stains that could not be cleaned by the residents. Furthermore, C1 told this LPA that there is an odor, which was described as \u201cmold\u201d. Per C1, the concern of cleanness was the bathroom (downstairs and upstairs), kitchen, and garage. On August 28, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed C2. Per C2, the upstairs bathroom, \"it smells bad, like a sewer\" (when water is turned on from the faucet). Per C2, the maintenance people came and said it had something to do with the plumbing. Furthermore, C2 told this LPA that others have complained about the smell and that the THPP agency representatives did not do anything about taking care of the smell.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed C3. Per C3, the kitchen sink had a stinky smell, and, in the garage, it smelled and had insects and spiders. C3 described the smell in the kitchen sink as \"old food\".

C3 stated to this LPA, \u201cI had seen a cockroach behind the refrigerator in the kitchen\u201d. On May 21, 2020, LPA Sam Raissi received photos with the initial complaint. A total of eight (8) photos. The photos are of the kitchen, bathroom, and garage. The photos indicate that the THPP home was not a clean environment for the participants. The photos show that there were dirt and debris in the kitchen and bathroom drawers, and the garage was cluttered with items. The agency listed above this report has since removed the items in the garage while this investigation was being conducted. Based on interviews with three participants, observations by this LPA, and photos of the kitchen, bathroom, and garage, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the allegation of \u201cfacility staff did not provide a clean environment for youth\u201d, is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. The agency listed above this report was issued an Advisory Note \u2013Technical Assistance attached on document (LIC 9102TA). Title 22 Division 6 regulations were not cited during this visit. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was sent to Cheryl Rouse. Second allegation attached on document (LIC 9099-A)\n\nThe finding for the allegation, \u201cplacement home has mold\u201d is Unsubstantiated. The evidence for the allegation: \u201cplacement home has mold\u201d as follows; On May 28, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed S1. S1 told this LPA that there hasn't been anything brought to her attention about the THPP house having mold. On May 28, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed C1. Per C1, the showers had mold, near the drain, and other areas in the shower. On August 28, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed C2.

C2 told this LPA that there was not mold in the home. On November 5, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed C3. C3 stated, that the downstairs bathroom sink \u201csmelled really bad. I never smelled mold before, so I don\u2019t know what mold smells like, but it stank really bad\u201d. Interviews with staff members (S1 interviewed on, May 28, 2020) and (S2 interviewed on, June 1, 2020) show that both S1 and S2 were unaware of mold at the THPP home. Observations of the THPP home (on May 28, 2020) conducted by this LPA, could not determine if there was mold in the bathrooms. The photos obtained by the confidential witness does not indicate that there is mold. Therefore, this LPA could not determine if there was mold in the THPP home, therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Those in favor of S2 felt the complaint originates from C3 and former client C6, is a result of having a feud with C2 and their poor relationship with S2. The two (2) clients that felt uncomfortable with S2 (C3 and C4) stated they have seen client(s) C1 and C2 in S2's room together usually on the internet at night. C3 stated she never witnessed C2 inside S2's room at 0500 hours, but she assumes so because C2 was not in her room and thinks C2's excuse of vaping outside is a lie. C3 and C4 felt C2 was flirty and touchy with S2, and that he stared at their buttocks when they walked upstairs. It was noted that C3 and C4 have a poor relationship with staff and clients. C2 denied being in S2's room, stating she is asleep by 0300 or 0400 hours. S2 stated he also slept before 0200 hours because he gets ready for work at 0800 hours. S2 stated he only enters a client's room to check for unauthorized visitors, pick up cleaning supplies forgotten by clients, and to conduct COVID-19 temperature checks. S2 and C2 both stated after the first investigation from CCL (staff sexually abusing the client has already been investigated in case number: CA2620-02028 by Investigator Austin), they do not speak to each other because they do not want more rumors being created from the other clients. Based on IB investigator Phung\u2019s interviews and observations made by LPA Raissi, two (2) out of five (5) clients (C3 and C4) felt uncomfortable with S2.

    "narrative": "Evidence for the allegation \u201cMinor is not being adequately supervised\u201d, as follows: Five (5) out of seven (7) individuals interviewed (C1, S1, S2, S3, and IPM) told this LPA that C1 is following the program rules and that C1 has received adequate supervision. Staffing schedules from (3/07/2021 \u2013 4/03/2021) show that there has been adequate supervision at the THPP residence. Staffing schedules were obtained from Bill Wilson Center representatives on (3/26/2021). Two (2) out of seven (7) individuals interviewed (SPO and PO) told this LPA that C1 is not receiving adequate supervision. The individuals interviewed have concerns about the lack of an employee residing onsite at the THPP Bill Wilson Center and that the THPP representatives told (PO and SPO) that the program is an independent living program and there are not twenty-four hours, seven days a week (24/7) staff coverage. Based on this LPA\u2019s review of records and interviews the THPP representatives have increased supervision for C1 based on the needs of the client, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Evidence for the allegation \u201cMinor did not receive services\u201d, as follows: Five (5) out of seven (7) individuals interviewed (C1, S1, S2, S3, and IPM) told this LPA that C1 is following the program and that C1 is receiving services. Based on interviews and observations by this LPA there was a disconnect between what services should be referred by the Probation Department representatives and what services the THPP should be providing. Based on the THPP program the services are being provided; C1 is interning at the (Young Women\u2019s Freedom). Per IPM, C1 is very engaged in the internship. C1 is involved with life coaching and does peer advisory for other youth in the program. C1 comes in daily, weekdays, Monday through Thursday. Per IPM, C1 has been an intern since March (2021) but involved with the center since (2019). C1 is reliable and comes in on time. C1 rarely misses coming in. Since March C1 has only been absent two (2) or three (3) times. In addition, C1 attends a support group (New Hope for Youth), which helps her with services, such as, finding career opportunities and counseling. Bill Wilson Center representatives conduct weekly house meetings to address any needs or services for the youth in placement and to fulfill Assembly Bill (AB) 12 requirements.\n\nEvidence for the allegation \u201cMinor is not attending school\u201d, as follows: Five (5) out of seven (7) individuals interviewed (C1, S1, S2, S3, and IPM) told this LPA that C1 is following the program and that C1 has been attending school. Based on interviews C1 had difficulty at the beginning of the program because of online learning due to COVID-19 restrictions. Based on interviews, C1 is on track to graduate and is attending classes as she is eager to graduate. C1\u2019s biological father has the education rights. Therefore, Bill Wilson Center representatives do not have direct access to school records. LPA Raissi attempted to contact C1\u2019s biological father for further details. C1\u2019s biological father did not return LPA Raissi call. Based on absence records obtained by PO from (2/22/2021 - 4/1/2021) there were absences, but C1 was attending classes and this was in the time-frame when C1 was having difficulty adjusting to the online classes. LPA Raissi could not retrieve further records due to C1\u2019s biological father having the educational rights for C1. Five (5) out of seven (7) persons interviewed (C1, S1, S2, S3, and IPM) were in favor of C1\u2019s progress in the THPP program and denied the allegation(s). Based on two (2) out of seven (7) persons interviewed (PO and SPO) were in favor of the allegation(s) and do not think that the Bill Wilson Center THPP program is an adequate placement for C1. During this investigation, it was revealed that the Juvenile Court Judge asked to pursue C1\u2019s placement at the Bill Wilson Center THPP program. Based on interviews, records obtained, and observations by this LPA there is not enough evidence to prove the allegation(s). Therefore, the complaint findings are Unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On 4/5/24, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Isabel Diego conducted a case management visit to address deficiencies found during an investigation at the facility. LPA and LPM met with Director Audra Stance and informed of the purpose of the visit. Based on confidential observations, interviews, and record review, the following deficiencies were found. Staff spoke about residents\u2019 personal matters, including a resident\u2019s private health matter, with other resident(s) and therefore did not ensure confidentiality. LPA is issuing a citation of Transitional Housing Placement Program Nonminor Dependent (AB12) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 86272 Personal Rights, Subsection (a)(12). Staff arrived to a residential unit in the middle of the night and banged on a resident\u2019s bedroom door to wake them up due to them not responding to the staff member earlier in the day. Additionally, a staff member told a resident that they were blocking the resident from contacting their phone number. LPA is issuing a citation of ILS Section 86272 Personal Rights, Subsection (a)(11). The facility became aware of residents engaging in dangerous behaviors such as illegal sex work and threats of violence toward another resident. Further, written correspondence reflects social worker(s) may not have been notified of ongoing behavior incidents and issues leading up to a termination from the program in a timely manner. LPA is issuing a citation of ILS Section 86261 Reporting Requirements, Subsection (c). SEE PAGE 2\n\nPAGE 2 Additionally, the facility did not follow the approved plan of operation (POO) dated 04/12/2023. The facility fined two residents for property damage caused by a physical altercation that resulted in damage to an interior door and a mirror. The residents were required to split the cost of the repair. The POO indicates a damage deposit of $500 is to be set aside for each resident, from which the cost of damages will be deducted, and an itemized damage report is to be completed. This was not followed. Additionally, the facility sent a notice to residents via text of various policy changes, including putting leases and bills in the residents\u2019 names and changing program incentives, and did not report the changes to the Department until instructed by the Department to do so. LPA is issuing a citation of ILS Section 86261 Reporting Requirements, Subsection (d). Lastly, during today's visit, LPA observed that certificate of compliances were only available for one of four residential sites in use, and two remote residential sites were approved for use without notification made to the Licensing agency. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Chapter 7, Section 86030.5 Identification of Transitional Housing Placement Program Participant Living Units, Subsection (a) and Section 86031.5 Notification, Subsection (b). Furthermore, LPA and LPM provided technical assistance with applicable requirements, including reportable incidents, law enforcement contacts, certificate of compliances. See attached LIC 809-D pages. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Director Audra Stance.",

    "narrative": "On 06/04/2025, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Jonathan Medina conducted an unannounced annual inspection and met with Wesley Sheppard, Lead Case Manager. Director Audra Stance is currently out of town and authorized Wesley Sheppard to facilitate the inspection via phone. LPA Medina confirmed that the Designation of Facility Responsibility form was completed prior to Director Stance\u2019s departure. Upon arrival, no staff were present in the office. Staff arrived at approximately 11:10 AM. The Transitional Housing Placement Plus Foster Care (THP+FC) program serves non-minor dependents. During the inspection, LPA received an updated copy of the LIC500 Personnel Report to ensure the facility\u2019s records remain current. An updated list of participant residential units was also obtained. A review of the Guardian background check system on June 4, 2025, confirmed that all staff associated with the program had cleared Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Child Abuse Central Index (CACI) background checks. Using the CARE Inspection Tool, LPA conducted a walkthrough of the office at 11:45 AM. The office has sufficient space for confidential meetings, and the agency\u2019s license was observed to be prominently posted. LPA also observed a designated room for client relaxation. No deficiencies were noted during this portion of the inspection. Continues on LIC809-C\n\nAt approximately 12:00 PM, LPA reviewed five client files. The facility representative was unable to provide Needs and Services Plans or equivalent documentation for four out of the five client files reviewed. Admission agreements, consent forms, emergency contacts, personal property/valuables lists, and signed personal rights acknowledgements were present. An area for improvement observed by LPA Medina was the organization of clients\u2019 cash resource records. Currently, all records are combined into one folder, rather than being individualized per client for Licensing review. One deficiency and one technical advisory were identified in this section. Please refer to LIC809-D and LIC9102 for further details. At 2:00 PM, LPA reviewed five staff files. No deficiencies were identified using the CARE Inspection Tool.

    "narrative": "On July 8, 2025, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Jonathan Medina conducted an unannounced Post Licensing Inspection and met with Mandave Sandhu, Lead Case Manager. Due to a prior unsuccessful attempt to finalize a visit, this inspection is labeled as an \"Annual\" in FAS; however, it is officially the facility\u2019s Post Licensing inspection. As the facility failed to accommodate two previous inspection attempts, a deficiency is being cited under Title 22, Section 80044(c) \u2013 Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency. Please refer to LIC 809-D for further information. Staff began arriving at the facility at approximately 11:30 AM. The Transitional Housing Placement Plus Foster Care (THP+FC) program serves non-minor dependents. During the inspection, LPA obtained an updated LIC 500 (Personnel Report) to ensure the facility\u2019s records are current. An updated list of participant residential units was also collected. A review of the Guardian background check system on July 8, 2025, confirmed that all staff associated with the program had cleared Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Child Abuse Central Index (CACI) background checks. However, one staff member\u2014John \u201cNick\u201d Moriana, the facility\u2019s Administrator\u2014was not associated with the facility in Guardian. LPA reminded the facility that all staff working for CA Impact Coalition must be associated with the facility in Guardian. The Administrator was successfully associated by the end of the visit. At 11:45 AM, LPA conducted a walkthrough of the administrative office using the CARE Inspection Tool. The office has sufficient space for confidential meetings, and the agency\u2019s license was prominently posted. LPA also observed a designated room intended for client relaxation. Client and staff files were stored in a secure room with locked cabinets. No deficiencies were observed during this portion of the inspection.\n\nAt approximately 12:00 PM, LPA reviewed five client files. The facility was able to provide Needs and Services Plans for all five clients selected at random. However, the plans were missing signatures from the authorized placing agency representative. The facility sent the plans to the assigned social workers during the inspection, and the signatures were obtained before the conclusion of the visit. A technical violation was issued. Please refer to LIC 9102 for additional details. Admission agreements, consent forms, emergency contact information, personal property/valuables lists, and signed personal rights acknowledgments were present in all reviewed files. At 1:30 PM, LPA reviewed two of the three staff files listed on the facility\u2019s LIC 500. The three identified staff included the Licensee, Administrator, and one Case Manager. However, there was no personnel file available for the Licensee. A deficiency was cited under Title 22, Section 80066(a) \u2013 Personnel Records. While the facility attempted to gather the necessary documentation during the visit, the Licensee\u2019s file was not available upon request. Other staff files contained the required documentation, including current First Aid/CPR certifications, fingerprint clearances, educational verification, TB test results, criminal record statements, health screenings, personnel records, and employee rights forms. Please refer to LIC 809-D for further information. At 2:00 PM, LPA reviewed the Operations section of the CARE Tool. All residential units had valid Certificates of Compliance, and an updated client roster was provided. No deficiencies were observed in this area. At 2:30 PM, LPA reviewed the facility\u2019s disaster preparedness documentation, including the LIC 610C. LPA verified that all staff had assigned roles in the event of an emergency. However, the facility was unable to provide documentation confirming that emergency drills had been conducted. A technical assistance was given in this area to start keeping this record in binder. Please refer to LIC9102 for details. This Post Licensing Inspection is now complete. As a result, the facility was cited for two violations: one under Section 80066(a) \u2013 Personnel Records, and one under Section 80044(c) \u2013 Inspection Authority of the Licensing Agency. In addition, two technical violations/assistances were noted: one for missing authorized representative signatures on Needs and Services Plans, and one for the lack of documentation for emergency drills. Please refer to LIC 9102 for more details. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights were provided, and a copy of this report was left with Lead Case Manager Mandave Sandhu, whose signature confirms receipt.",

LPA found 3 of 6 discharged clients to not have a signed copy of written removal or discharge. The Program Director stated that former staff did provide support services to the clients but did not provide proper documentation. Also, during an interview PD explained that the process for documenting maintenance requests is for the the case managers to write them in case notes. During file review, 6 clients had files showing maintenance as being requested, 5 of these files were observed to have no documentation provided in subsequent case notes as to whether the issue(s) had been resolved. LPA reviewed six files of clients who had been discharged from the agency. Two out of six clients were given proper written notice of discharge but had to be discharged before the scheduled date due to emergency circumstances, which were documented. LPA observed proper written notice was given to one additional client. Three clients had no record of written notice of discharge notice in the file. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. Citations are being issued for violating Interim Licensing Standards Section 86270, Non-Minor Dependents Records and 86268.4, Removal or Discharge Procedures A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and LIC-9099D were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted. Appeal rights were provided.\n\nTwo clients reported lack of support to understand their finances as being a big concern. Interviews with ASW\u2019s, CSWs, and clients point to living conditions as being a potential barrier to meeting goals, however, all agreed that it is very difficult to secure more desirable housing. Both CSW\u2019s, a probation officer, and two clients reported the Agency Social Workers are dedicated to meeting the needs and providing great supervision to the clients. While maintenance and pest control issues were commonly reported, three of four clients and four of seven agency social workers agreed that these problems were addressed promptly. LPA observed case notes written by current staff to be more detailed and thorough than case notes written by previous staff. Interviews with previous staff conflict with interviews with current staff who all reported that they are given the support and supervision from administration that allows them to provide proper care and supervision to meet clients\u2019 needs. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur.

    "narrative": "CSW said that P1 initially refused a heater for the residence but CSW told THP they needed to provide one anyway and let P1 decide if he wanted to use it, noting that it was summertime at when P1 moved in and he may not have been thinking ahead to wintertime. On 12/2/2020, the LPA contacted Janice Saelee, Program Manager (PM) who stated the water was repaired and P1 was told to turn on the main water main after 24 hours. PM said that P1 has turned this knob off in the past and knows how to operate it. On 2/19/2021, The LPA contacted the landlords (LL1 and LL2) who own the residence that P1 lived in. When asked to describe ASW's attire LL1 said, \"Professional\u2026everybody\u2019s doing everything they can to help him [P1] and he\u2019s just sabotaging\u2026\" LL1 said that THP handles all move in/out duties and they \u201cbasically rent this apartment to Children\u2019s First.\u201d When asked about the repairs made to the residence LL2 said, \"The only thing I know about was the issue with a leak...knocked on the door, he [P1] answered and yelled like a maniac\u2026threatened to kill him because I was on his property\u2026I went back after and some girl from the child place met me there when he wasn\u2019t there\u2026all the caulking had been dug out\u2026obviously it was the kid..\u201d The LPA also contacted ASW who said that P1 told her about a bug problem over the summer, so she purchased bug bombs for him. ASW said her efforts to take care of the leaks were delayed due to P1 not allowing LL2 to enter the residence after verifying the appointment. ASW explained that P1 rarely responded to her attempts for communication via phone or text, but that he would sometimes respond via THP\u2019s Facebook Messenger account and usually only when he was expecting a check. ASW said she purchased two phones for P1 so he could stay in contact with THP and CSW, but that this didn\u2019t help. ASW added that she is required to make contact weekly and after 72 hours without contact conducts a welfare check. ASW said P1 was initially concerned that some of his property would be damaged due to the leak but nothing was. ASW said she purchased two heaters for P1 and has the receipts. ASW said that she worked with P1 consistently regarding housing, finding a job, attending school, and receiving counseling but that P1 lacked motivation. ASW said she \u201chooked him up with the ILP Program\u201d but that P1 said they weren\u2019t very helpful. ASW said she talked with P1 several times about him needing to stay active with job applications and communication to stay in the program. On 2/21/2021, the LPA contacted P1 who stated THP was not able to fix the leaks, so he eventually moved. P1 said the reason it took so long was because the cause of the leak couldn\u2019t be identified. When asked about an incident when LL2 came to fix the leak P1 said LL2 entered the residence without knocking first. P1 said \u201cthings are better now\u201d but could not articulate anything THP could have done better or differently. When asked what program participants are responsible for, P1 could not provide any details aside from needing a job. When asked what the THP is responsible for, P1 could not provide any details but said they gave him gas money. On 2/26/2021, the LPA contacted PM who confirmed THP did not have P1's final Home Inspection Checklist from the residence addressed in the complaint allegations. (Page 2/3).\n\nThe LPA reviewed ASW\u2019s Contact Notes from 10/1/20 to 12/1/20. ASW addressed P1 needing a job and counseling services on a regular basis. P1 expressed that COVID-19 was a barrier. Concerns for P1\u2019s participation in the program and mental health were also documented. ASW documented that multiple checks were provided for interview clothes and phones. Several notes were documented regarding ongoing leak issues however a five-day gap with no documented communication was identified. On 11/25/20, ASW documented the following: landlord [LL2] came out to inspect shower pan, put more sealant around it, and asked that the shower not be used for 24 hours, P1 was fine to stay with former roommate; on 12/1/20 ASW documented a phone call to P1 about \u201chim being able to turn water on now and use the shower as well as process of finding new housing.\u201d The LPA reviewed a Serious Incident Report dated 11/13/2020 that documented P1 agreed to LL2 coming to fix the leak on 11/13/20 and was advised verbally and in text that the visit would be early morning. P1 agreed to this on 11/12/20 after the issues were not fixed by the plumbing company. The morning of 11/13, ASW1 messaged P1 firming up an exact time of LL2\u2019s visit for 11am. When LL2 arrived and knocked on P1\u2019s door, P1 answered and would not allow LL2 inside becoming \u201chostile and aggressive\u201d pushing LL2 out of the doorway and yelling in his face. LL2 called ASW to report P1 would not allow him access into the unit to fix the leak issue. ASW reached out to P1 about the incident and P1 advised ASW that he was not aware of the time and that the LL2 just tried walking in. ASW spoke with LL2 and P1 to reconcile the issue and rescheduled for LL2 to come out without P1 being present. The LPA reviewed the Home Inspection Checklists that were available. It is unclear if the residence was ready for P1 to move into last summer. The LPA reviewed email correspondence between CSW and ASW. On 11/18/20, ASW states the water had been shut off the week before. On 11/20/20, ASW told CSW LL2 would come out the following Monday (11/23/20) at 1pm to fix the issue and they were unable to come out sooner because they needed at least 24 hours\u2019 notice to do so. CSW said the shower was not finished being fixed until 11/25/20 and after the leak was fixed is when P1 was asked to not use the shower for 24 or 48 hours but that he could use the water in the rest of the house, although the water had not been turned back on at the main. On 12/01/20, CSW reports that P1 told her the water had not been turned back on and ASW was not responding to him about it. On 12/02/20, ASW told CSW she told P1 multiple times he needed to turn the water back on at the main. On 12/02/20, PM went out and turned the water back on at the main. The LPA reviewed an email from CSW sent on 2/19/21 regarding the iFoster phone. CSW stated that P1 received that phone on 01/20/20, rarely used it, and in March 2020 ASW told CSW she believed P1 gave it away. CSW and ASW offered to help P1 get a replacement / different phone. The LPA also reviewed the THP Program Statement Social Worker Job Description and Personnel Policies. There is no reference to professional attire and no details pertinent to the investigation. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report will be sent to the THP via email with a read receipt requested.",

The Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD) contacted three facility staff, one County Social Worker, two landlords, one program participant, and one family member, and conducted reviewed records. On 11/30/2020, the LPA contacted P1\u2019s family member who stated there has been \"major water issues for weeks and weeks;\" the issues may have been fixed but Heather Sparks, Agency Social Worker (ASW) \"has been very diligent in trying to get him [P1] to do what he should be doing...let\u2019s things slide...\u201d The family member also said ASW does not wear professional attire for home visits. The LPA contacted Shannon Pierce, Chief Operating Officer who was not aware of any issues with P1 but does not work with them on a usual basis. The LPA contacted Alexa Costa, County Social Worker (CSW) who stated they are concerned with how long it took THP to address the leaks and because THP did not inform CSW of the leaks. CSW said it is her understanding that the water was off for one week and has been given different timeframes from multiple people. (Page 1/3).",

The Needs and Service Plans (NSP) which were available for LPA to review were not signed by the client, and not specific to the client. Case notes were incomplete and unavailable when LPA first requested them. SWS later stated the missing notes were \u201cat home,\u201d and if they had known LPA was going to the office they would have asked another staff member \u201cto go to my house to retrieve them.\u201d SWS noted concerns with the client on the case notes, but no follow up services were documented. SWS provided LPA with a chart documenting the dates of their home visits with clients. The dates on the chart did not match the dates of the submitted case notes. For 6 clients, the chart reflects that the SWS made home visits, however the corresponding case notes says there was no home visit on that date. When interviewed, a client on SWS\u2019s case load indicated home visits usually lasted about 5-10 minutes. A social worker indicated the training provided upon hire was not nearly sufficient and SWS was not readily available when the social worker had questions. SWS admitted during an interview that their case notes and NSP\u2019s were not current, and this was partly due to the facility being short staffed, and the SWS on vacation. Based on the preponderance of evidence that was met through interviews, observation, and record review, the allegation of: Social work supervisor duties are not being met is SUBSTANTIATED. The Social Worker Supervisor had a caseload and failed to fulfill duties as a Social Worker. Due to missing and incomplete notes, there is insufficient evidence to verify the Social Work Supervisor was supervising the placement of the participant and providing supportive services. The facility is cited per Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 7, Article 06.

CCL reminded Licensee to report these incidents to CCL as they are reportable incidents. CCL informed provider that they should conduct internal investigations with clients and staff to determine whether there is a violation of the plan of operation or CCL regulations. Provider was also informed to document consequences and make sure it is accessible to CCL when NMD's violate their contract.\n\nAlthough it is undetermined whether the NMD's child was left unsupervised there is a possibility of a lack of supervision during the times that the client was smoking and drinking in the car port. CCL suggests that case managers conduct meetings at different times throughout the week and more frequently to verify compliance to NMD THPP contract. Licensee stated that they provide staff and clients with drug and alcohol abuse awareness resources, this should be recorded in client's files if client has a history of substance abuse. Provider informed CCL that clients sign logs when attending the provided life skills training's. Case Managers conduct face to face case management visits weekly, to preform environment checks and to provide life skills training. This documentation must be made available to CCL. CCL received the revised Plan of Operation and will follow up with the provider within 30 day to determine whether the revisions meet licensing requirements. CCL will move forward with the capacity increase. Provider must submit personnel report LIC 500 showing updated supervision/work schedule for updated capacity.

Review of documents showed that a youth moved into an apartment provided and maintained by the THPP on June 21, 2024. Shortly after moving into the apartment, youth noticed fleas in the apartment. Youth advised THPP about the fleas and requested carpet to be cleaned. In confidential interviews it was revealed that the youth sent a picture to the Transitional Social Worker showing fleas in the apartment and on the rug. TSW said that there were fleas in the picture received, however it was not determined if the fleas were dead or alive. LPA observed documentation that the THPP treated the apartment two (2) times before youth moved in. It was revealed that there were fleas and bugs on the carpet. TSW said the THPP treated the apartment for fleas and changed the carpet after youth complained. Youth could not stay at the apartment due to the fleas biting. Youth stayed at a relative\u2019s home, until the issue was resolved or relocated to a new apartment. In other interviews, the THPP was not made aware that the bathtub would not drain.

The incident reported in part, on 8/12/2023, a participant was stabbed at the THPP\u2019s remote site by another participant resulting in the death of one participant. The participant who committed the stabbing was subsequently arrested as a result. CCL Investigator, Douglas Real conducted the investigation consisting of confidential interviews with facility residents, staff members and contacts with the Ventura Police Department. The investigation revealed residents live independently in their own residences and Facility Case Managers conduct weekly visits to the Participants homes to monitor and assess Participant progress as well as provide guidance and assistance with independent living. Participants #1 (P1) and #2 (P2) resided in the same apartment and their case manager visited both participants two days prior to the incident leading to P1\u2019s death. Records reviewed revealed P1 resided in the residence for ten days prior to the incident and no issues, problems, or safety concerns were reported to the case manager by either participant. Confidential statements revealed no apparent problems or issues with the care provided by the facility or its employees. Statements obtained further deny claims of neglect or lack of supervision resulted in the stabbing death of P1 by P2. Based on the statements gathered, and records reviewed the Department has determined there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred or that neglect, or lack of supervision resulted in the stabbing death of P1 by P2. The Department\u2019s finding is therefore determined Unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies per California Code of Regulations cited at this time. Exit interview completed.

    "narrative": "The two toured units posed some physical plant concerns of a broken sliding door, cracked mirror, and front door panel damage. These concerns were cited and addressed during the initial visit. LPA was unable to justify rodents and expired food due to specific units not identified in the photos. Confidential interviews indicated that participants could leave their unit to go to work, school, and conduct personal business. Per staff interviews, the following was stated: Participants are required to notify case manager if they will be gone beyond a 24-hour period. Participants are required to work or be enrolled as a requirement of the program. The program was providing transportation prior to COVID but now encourages participants to take public transportation. Participants are responsible for purchasing their own hygiene products. The allegations stated minors are not provided allowance however, per client and staff interviews, an allowance is given every two weeks. There is no supporting evidence and it is unclear which clients did not receive an allowance. Per staff interviews, support was provided for budgeting and saving however, due to COVID it stopped and there isn\u2019t a set date for it to return. While touring one of the units, LPA/LPM observed a participant asking for parenting and anger management classes and staff stated they would accommodate. The initial photos provided, were not dated nor did they identify which unit they were taken in. The concerns do not reflect in the allegations and the alleged allegations occurred two years ago. Based on review and analyzing all of the evidence, the LPA has found this complaint to be Unsubstantiated, meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. There were no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report and appeal rights will be emailed to the Case Mgr Supervisor and The Program Administrator Due to technical difficulties with the LPA's printer.",

Based on the inability to interview the clients or gain entry into their apartments, the above allegations are resolved as unsubstantiated. An unsubstantiated finding means that an allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.",

LPA informed of the purpose of the meeting, which was to discuss the Department's request for revisions to the program's plan of operation (POO). The Department was recently made aware that a revised participant agreement has been used by the provider. Upon review of the POO and the participant agreement document approved by the Department, the licensee is advised to make the following revisions to their POO. 1) Submit all revisions, including the participant agreement, to the Department for review. 2) Indicate in the POO the minimum stipend/allowance and the method(s) used to determine how much a participant receives in greater detail. 3) Remove fines as a consequence. LPA advised that the licensee revise this section to reframe consequences in a positive reinforcement manner and discussed ways to accomplish this during the meeting. 4) Remove the pet fine. LPA advises that having a pet is a rule violation, but applicable regulatory and/or licensing requirements provide that participants' cash resources must be free of any liability the licensee incurs. 5) Remove the move-in kit charge. LPA advises that the THPP is required to supply basic furnishing as a basic service in order to maintain licensure, and applicable regulatory and/or licensing requirements disallow a licensee from making expenditures from participants' cash resources for basic services. LPA discussed applicable regulatory sections, including Title 22, Sections 86126(d), 86126(f), 86088(a),86001(b)(2), and Nonminor Dependent Interim Licensing Standards for THPP, Section 86226.

It was alleged that NMD could not visit the doctor for a skin rash. Confidential interviews reported that NMD was told by staff they were not allowed to leave to see a doctor for the skin rash. Confidential interviews reported that NMD was responsible for making appointments with doctors, and they were allowed to leave their house when they wanted. Additional confidential interviews reported that NMD was not shown how to make their (NMD) doctor\u2019s appointments, which was the reason for not making an appointment for the skin rash.

Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegations that facility staff (S1) handled the client (NMD) inappropriately and refused to allow the client (NMD) to seek medical attention are unsubstantiated.

Additional confidential interviews reported that S1 would not grab or pull NMD and would stay out of the way of NMD to avoid getting pushed.

Surrender license and apply for two more licenses separately. Licensees initially started as a partnership and are currently a corporation, however the financial information was under an individual, rather than the corporation. If Licensees choose to stay intact with the corporation, and to submit a new application for a second THPP, the Licensees will need to submit a Board Resolution stating agreement with their plans. Licensee will also correct the financials through the corporation. Licensees can change their facility names if they so choose. CCL will work with the Licensees to correct the current program statement if Licensees choose to keep it, and assist with the potential new program statement. LPM informed Licensees how to proceed whether they completely separate, choose to stay under the same corporation, or one licensee takes over the license and the other branches off with their own separate application. Licensees will inform CCL how they would like to proceed by 8/1/2024, and CCL will assist them through that process. An exit interview was conducted with the licensees and a copy of this report was emailed to them with a read receipt. Licensees will sign the document and return it to LPA.",

One of the messages uncovered stated \"we have a connection & we care about each other\". The allegation that RP engaged in conduct that is inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of clients in the facility is related to this inappropriate contact, conversations and communications between C1 and RP. In addition, Investigator Burton received information that C1 and RP were found by a third party sleeping clothed together in the same bed at least one time and a picture showing that C1 and RP in clothes and in bed together (not the same incidents). RP was told that C1 may have had a crush on RP but RP did not stop the inappropriate messages or communications and even admitted that communications between C1 and RP were emotionally involved. As a result of the interviews conducted, documentation reviewed and investigation conducted, the allegation that resource parent had an inappropriate relationship with client in care and resource parent engaged in conduct that is inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of clients in the facility are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. Facility cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 84072(d) Personal Rights. Investigation shows that RP carried on an inappropriate relationship with C1 that appeared to be emotionally abusive in nature. These discussions included content of a sexual nature and were inappropriate as the nature of the relationship was that of care provider/mentor and youth in care. Facility cited for violation of Health and Safety \u00a71569.58(a)(2) Officers, directors and employees of licensed facility... Investigation shows that staff engaged in conduct that is inimical to the health, morals, welfare or safety of an individual in or receiving services from the facility, or the people of the State of California as it relates to the inappropriate contact, conversations and communications between C1 and RP. Exit interview conducted with Kitty Cannon and document provided.\n\nWhen interviewed, C1 alleged that the relationship between C1 and RP was \"intimate and very sexual\" but denied there was sexual intercourse or penetration or other contact of a sexual nature. C1 denied that C1 and RP ever kissed but did make statements about inappropriate touching over the clothing that could not be corroborated. As a result of the interviews conducted, documentation reviewed and investigation conducted, the allegation that resource parent had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a client in care is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "In LPA's review of the Premise Report, collected from the Sacramento Sheriff's Department, it lists out all Calls for Service made by members of the public, at or tied to the apartment complex address, from January 2020 through Present 2023. There were 280 total calls for service, some of which were four for shots fired, two assault, one sexual assault, 15 battery, six assault with a deadly weapon, 90 disturbances, four threats with a gun or other weapon, three threats, five burglary, one petty theft, one grand theft, one auto theft, three vandalism, four trespassing, two suspicious vehicles, and eight suspicious circumstances. These records only show what kind of call was made, not where the violation occurred, so it is possible not all of these events occurred at the apartment complex, however were reported by individuals at the complex, or about individuals at the complex. In LPA's review of the Case Notes provided, LPA found instances where maintenance was needed for minor issues, such as the heater pilot being out and a broken closet door, and the EA Case Manager (CM) assisted the client in getting those problems fixed. There were no concerns reported about insect issues. In Case Notes from 2020, when the client was first placed in November 2020, the client was not happy with the apartment due to safety concerns about personal conflicts with individuals in the community, and requested a change. EA then moved the client to the apartments the client then resided in from December 2020 to February 2023, to ensure the client felt safe. More current Case Notes from 2023 also detail how CM was helping the client get what they needed in regard to school, employment, and certifications. There were many entries which detailed all of CM\u2019s efforts in working with the client on getting the client an apartment they wanted, and supporting the client through their decisions. In several case notes it shows that CM was working on getting the client into another apartment of their choosing in 2023, however the client was indecisive about where the client actually wanted to live, whether it be with EA, a SILP, or with their spouse. The apartment the client was thinking about choosing was also out of EA's reasonable price range. The client went ahead with moving plans without speaking to, or working with EA at times, which led C1 to voluntarily leaving EA. Most recently, on 4/23/2023, the client submitted an inquiry about coming back to EA.\n\nLPA also observed the environment of the apartments. LPA did observe a bullet hole in the hallway of one of the buildings, pointed out to LPA by a tenant. This tenant stated that had been there since before the tenant lived there, which is over four years ago. LPA also observed one bullet hole in the face of the building to the right of the vending machines, and a bullet mark on the vending machine cage itself. It is unclear when those marks were made. LPA observed many children out and playing together, as well as several adults going about their business. LPA observed all individuals to appear homed, and non-suspicious. LPA did not observe any criminal activity while she was at the apartment complex. When LPA conducted interviews with the six randomly selected tenants, LPA could observe the apartments, to varying degrees whether LPA went inside or not, and observed all spaces to be modernized, and in good condition. LPA did not observe any bugs or other pests. When LPA did a walk-through of the apartment unit related to this complaint specifically, LPA also observed it to be clean, semi-modernized, and without bugs or other pests. Confidential interviews conducted revealed the following: In LPA's interviews with the Intake Workers, Director, Case Manager, and Social Work Supervisor, it was confirmed that it is the client's choice to accept an apartment, and if they do not approve of it, EA will work to find a better match for the client. During LPA's interview with the Case Manager, he stated he never observed any insects. LPA Burgess and LPA Monica Roberts requested in total three times, the photographic evidence from the individual involved, of the insects which were alleged to have been in the apartment, however LPA never received them. In LPA's interview with the Property Manager (PM), there were no records of insects being reported as an issue in the client's unit, however, the PM also stated that they will do regular preventative insect spraying. All six randomly-selected tenants, and the one current EA client, that LPA interviewed stated they felt safe at the apartment, and some reported small issue with children running around with trash, or the homeless coming into the complex. PM also stated that all issues that were reported to her by the client were addressed by maintenance. PM stated that the area is a rough area, but has improved since she has come to the complex in May of 2021, and they have gotten new tenants.\n\nIn LPA's interview with the Deputy, it was confirmed that the area is a, \"dangerous,\" area with drugs, gangs, homelessness, poverty, and struggles; however, many areas of Sacramento are like that, and at the same time, you will see children walking home from school, and regular non-criminal daily life. Additionally, the Deputy explained that the clients are adults and can choose whether or not to live there. LPA was also made aware in this interview that bullet holes/shootings happen in all areas of Sacramento, not only apartments such as this one. Based on all information collected and interviews conducted, LPA found that the area the apartment is in does have crime and dangers, however that is common in other areas as well. LPA learned that tenants feel safe, and Property Management addresses concerns. LPA found that EA Case Manager worked to support and assist the client in meeting their needs and helping them to get what they want as well. LPA also found that the clients have the final say-so in where they will be placed and can reject a placement, as well as EA will move them if they feel unsafe. LPA was informed there were cockroaches in the apartment by one individual, however saw no evidence of this, and did not receive evidence to prove such. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted with SWS and a copy of this report and appeal rights was left with her.",

LPA and SWS conducted a walk-through of the facility and LPA observed: two conference rooms, one file room, seven office spaces, two storage areas, one pantry, two kitchens, three visitation rooms, a staff lounge, the lobby, and four bathrooms. LPA observed no deficiencies. All fire extinguishers were in date and charged. All client files were locked. All areas of the building were clean, in good repair, and had no obstructions in the walkways. There are working smoke detectors. LPA reviewed five staff files and five client files. LPA found that 8 of 15 staff who work at this THPP license are not associated to the license. However, all 15 are DOJ/FBI/CACI cleared and associated to the agency's Sacramento FFA license. LPA found that all other staff requirements were met. For client files LPA found that the Administrator does not sign the Needs and Services Plans as required. One out of five NSPs were out of date, and the one that was out of date, was being drafted. All other requirements for client files were met. LPA interviewed two Social Workers, one Case Manager, and one Social Work Supervisor. On this date the agency is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86019(e)(2) and Health and Safety Code (HSC) 1565(a)(7).

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection regarding an Incident Report (IR) that occurred on 4/7/2023 and was submitted to CCL by the agency on 4/10/2023. LPA met with Case Manager Wendy Sanchez, who assisted with the inspection. The IR reported that on 4/7/2023 client's (C1 - See Confidential Names List dated 5/15/2023) EA Case Manager (CM) called Adult Protective Services for C1 due to C1 living in filth with rotting food, unwashed clothes, and trash throughout C1's apartment. The CM that was present reported bad smells in the apartment. C1 was non-coherent and could not verbally communicate. C1 had been neglecting C1's basic needs, and EA was unsure if C1 was eating, maintaining personal hygiene, or their healthcare. LPA conducted an investigation into whether Environmental Alternatives - SAC THPP/THP+FC (EA) was an appropriate placement for C1 or not, by conducting confidential interviews with the County Social Worker, EA's Social Work Supervisor, EA's Case Manager, EA's THPP Director, and EA's Intake Coordinator on 4/17/2023, 4/26/2023, 5/11/2023, and 5/18/2023. LPA also collected and reviewed C1's Pre-Placement Questionnaire (PPQ), \"New-Add\" email, other emails, Needs and Services Plan, pictures, and TILP. Based on the records reviewed, LPA found that C1 was placed with EA on 11/15/2022, after leaving a mental health facility by 11/10/2022. In C1's PPQ, it notes that C1 has a, \"low level of functioning or ability to be independent,\" in the area of taking C1's medication for C1's mental health. It also states that C1 had been 5150'd on 10/11/2022, and then went to another mental health facility afterwards, where C1 lived until C1 was placed with EA. C1 has had suicidal behavior or thoughts before, but there were no\n\nadditional details provided. The PPQ states C1 has a need for intensive mental health or wrap services, however none were described. The PPQ acknowledged that C1 most likely is on psychotropic medication, however C1 refuses to take C1's medications. Additionally, C1 has not developed positive anger management and coping skills, and no further details were provided. C1 struggles with impulse control and has no positive lifelong connections. C1 does not demonstrate positive relationship skills with peers, and no details were provided. C1 has had major behavioral episodes, for which C1 was placed in a mental health hospital. C1 has a history of substance abuse and ongoing substance abuse issues in that C1 has admitted to using meth, \"and whatever else [C1] can get ahold of.\" C1 has threatened a roommate with a knife in the past. C1 is receiving mental health services, however refuses to cooperate with utilizing those services. C1 was placed in a specialized apartment which has on-site case managers of sorts, which are not affiliated with EA who provide additional support to clients and work with EA's Case Managers, though the level in which they do this was not made clear. During an interview, it was confirmed that C1 had drug paraphernalia (crack pipe and bong) in C1's apartment, located when EA had the apartment cleaned when C1 went to the hospital. Another crack pipe was located in C1's apartment previously on 3/1/2023 as well. During interviews it was confirmed that C1 continuously struggled with maintaining their apartment, never was compliant in managing their mental health or adhering to the program, and that both EA and the specialized apartment could not meet C1's needs. Most recently C1 was released from hospitalization on 4/28/2023, then re-hospitalized on 5/3/2023 for hallucinating, and returned to placement on 5/16/2023. EA CM observed C1 to be high on 5/16/2023 on something other than marijuana. During LPA's interviews, LPA asked why EA gave C1 placement knowing C1's unmanaged mental health, recent hospitalizations, unmanaged drug-use, and general inability to care for themself. LPA was informed it was essentially a, \"favor,\" to the County, who was struggling to find placement for the client, and to build a positive relationship with the County. During multiple interviews it was confirmed that EA cannot meet the needs of C1.\n\nEA has accepted C1 back into the program after discharge from the hospital on a Behavioral Contract, signed by C1 on 5/1/2023, requiring C1 to be compliant in managing C1's mental health services and medications. However, this should have been the standard since the beginning of C1's placement. Based on an interview, C1 is still not being compliant in their program or addressing their mental health and drug use. LPA reviewed C1's Needs and Services Plan which details mental health management as C1's main need to focus on and that, \"it is recommended that this client be placed in a transitional housing program with more support and assistance to help with the client's mental health needs. The current placement is not ideal for the client's needs.\" Since being in placement, C1 has been hospitalized two times, however there has been more than four 5150's. THPPs are the least-restrictive facility type in the Children's Residential Program. Based on all information collected and interviews conducted, LPA has found that C1's placement in EA's THPP was inappropriate and detrimental to their well-being. On this date, the facility is being cited for a violation of the AB12 Interim Licensing Standards for Nonminor Dependents in Foster Care, Chapter 7, Transitional Housing Placement Program, Version 2, Section 86278(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. An exit interview was conducted with CM and a copy of this report and appeal rights was left with CM.",

LPA met with Miranda Benavidez, Case Manager (CM), who assisted with the inspection. The incident which occurred on 6/17/2021 involved a client of the THPP attempting suicide by cutting both of her wrists with a knife while in the apartment. The client's fiance was also present in the apartment. Law enforcement, the fire department, and ambulance were on the scene. The client was taken to the hospital and treated, then was placed on a 5150 hold. Law enforcement believed there to be domestic violence from the fiance to the client. The agency wrote in the IR the fiance will no longer be allowed in the apartment. LPA asked questions regarding: 1. How is, and where is, the client currently. 2. How will the agency ensure the client's fiance is not present. 3. How will the agency ensure the client's safety. 4. Is this a proper placement of the client. 5. What oversight and support is provided for this client. 6. What is the agency's future plans for this client. CM stated that she has been contacting the client weekly to check in. CM also called in a wellness check, and conducted a wellness check herself, after the incident. The client is back at the apartment, and the fiance is not allowed on the property, however they were spotted off property engaged in an argument on 6/23/2021. CM, the County Social Worker, and the client will be meeting on 7/8/2021 to discuss safety plan and safety measures to take. In the meantime, LPA has advised CM to make contact with the client daily by phone to ensure she is safe. CM is also going to be getting the client into therapy as well as in contact with WEAVE for support with domestic violence. At 2:29 PM an exit interview was conducted with CM and a copy of this report will be emailed to CM with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

The facility utilizes their Sacramento FFA office as a satellite office for this license, where the majority of clients are assisted from. Only two clients are in care out of this office. As the files are electronic LPA was able to access them from the licensed location. LPA utilized the CARE Tool for this inspection. LPA conducted a walk-through of the agency with (OM) and LPA observed no deficiencies. LPA reviewed 14 client files, and 10 staff files. LPA found that all clients reviewed did not have any health screenings or TB tests on file, however, all clients are Non-Minor Dependents and are not required to share medical information with the agency. LPA found that one client did not have a Needs and Services Plan in the file as required after 30 days in placement. One client (C7) was missing their NSP, but today is the 30th day, so LPA advised the facility to ensure they include the NSP for that client in their file. Client C6 should have their NSP in file, and a Type B Citation was issued for that deficiency. There were no other issues found in client files. For the staff files, LPA found that no file had any of the staffs' duties described, and a Technical Violation was issued for that. No other issues were found during this inspection.

LPA spoke with Asifa Ali, Office Manager (OM2), who checked with the assigned case worker and found that P1 is the boyfriend of the client who has not moved in yet, awaiting fingerprint clearance. There is no paperwork for LPA to collect as the agency is awaiting the clearance before allowing P1 to move in. Further investigation is needed to conclude this case management.

The heater was not functioning for several weeks, but the ASW and management company addressed it. The client was given a portable heater until the heater was repaired. The ASW was responsive to the calls from the client and assisted by contacting the apartment management company on several occasions for the client. The agency addressed the client\u2019s minor pest control problem by ensuring there were two separate visits to the unit by a pest control company. In addition, the ASW dropped off several cans of bugs spray to the client. The client never contacted the property management company regarding the minor repairs needed. Work orders placed were done so by the ASW and were regarding the heater and pests. It is unclear if client was aware they were responsible for contacting the property management company for maintenance. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. No citation were given. A copy of this report was electronically sent at the time of the visit. An exit interview was conducted.",

LPA made contact with THPP Program Director, Anna Garrison regarding an incident. Community Care Licensing (CCL) received an incident report dated 11/18/20. The incident pertained to C1 participating in a THPP/THP+FC program. C1 received a 30 day notice from the property manager due to damage to her apartment. While C1 was on the phone with her Case Manager (CM), C1 went to the Property manager's office to discuss the 30 day notice that she received. During the conversation CM heard scuffle and raised voices. C1 and property manager were arguing back and forth. The police was called and a report was made. CM stated she heard Sgt and Officer state that they could see the property manager pushing and kicking C1 in the office video, however, the property manager felt threatened as C1 was being aggressive and threatening to property manager. The Officers stated that property manager could use force necessary to remove C1 from her office. C1 was upset that the police did not do anything about the situation. C1 argued and cussed at both the Officer and Sgt. C1 made threatening remarks about \"beating the shit\" out of property manager. C1 went to look for property manager and found her in her car. CM could hear C1 on the phone telling the property manager to get out of her car. C1 informed CM that she had popped the property manager's tires with a knife.\n\nC1 informed Case Manager that she wanted to fight the property manager. Program Director and Case Manager have attempted to work with C1 regarding incidents that have been harmful to herself and others and have put safety plans in place. However, EA-THPP will be discharging client from their THPP + FC program on December 17, 2020, which lines up with the 30 day notice from the property management. County Social Worker has been informed regarding the incidents and the discharge. No deficiencies were cited on today's date.

As a result of the information obtained and documentation reviewed, the complaint allegation is SUBSTANTIATED meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. Facility was cited for violation of Title 22 Division Six Section 86022(a)(4)(I) Plan of Operation. The plan of operation states that the monies received by the participants pay the expenses of rent, utilities, telephone, transportation, food...It further states that the participant's continued eligibility hinges on \"paying bills on time\". In addition, the plan of operation states that THP+FC/THPP staff...shall assist in payment of bills, conferring with the payee when necessary to insure payment has been made. There is no evidence that this was done as the leasing agency indicated that the utilities were either not paid or were paid late. Investigation showed that the agency was responsible for not paying C1's rent in a timely manner as the rent payment was late on at least two occasions, thus causing C1 to not be eligible for the month-to-month option upon the expiration of C1's lease. Subsequently, eviction proceedings for C1 were started as there is no documentation that the agency had other housing for C1 and C1 was unable to vacate in the allotted time.

LPA informed Ms. Curran that the complaint investigation included initial tele inspection to the facility 1/15/21, interviews with C1 (see LIC811 dated 5/20/21), C1's lawyer, reporting party, and review of documentation provided by the facility as well as documents provided by C1's lawyer. Investigation shows that C1 solely signed a lease agreement on 2/14/2014. At the end of C1's lease in 2015, C1 was trying to get her apartment complex to move to a month to month rental agreement and when C1 went to the leasing office to discuss the details, C1 was told that \"due to rent being paid late twice\" and \"late fees on utilities\", they would not be renewing C1's lease nor would they move to a month-to-month agreement. The case notes written by S1, C1's case worker at that time, indicate that on 1/22/2015, S1 did go to the leasing office to discuss that the \"late fee(s) on rent should not fall on [C1]'s record but on EA's behalf\" but the leasing office would still not go month-to-month with C1. The leasing agency informed C1 to vacate the premises by 2/14/2015. There is no documentation that the agency had other housing for C1 and C1 was unable to vacate in the allotted time.

At 10:00 AM LPA Valenzuela and LPM Mendoza arrived to facility and the administrator was not present. At 10:48 AM Lauren Grayman, Administrator arrived to the facility. At 11:00 AM, LPA did a walk-through inspection with Administrator of the office. Facility has access to password protected electronic files, which staff members have access to them. The office has sufficient space for confidential meetings, all participant files and staff files are located in a locked cabinet in a secure location. The agency has their license posted in their office. LPA spoke with Administrator about the residential units. Administrator stated that all residential units have all working toilets, sinks and tubs. At 11:40 AM ,LPA Valenzuela and LPM Mendoza reviewed 10 participants files (P1- P10) (Please refer to LIC 811 for confidential names, dated 05/24/22) with Administrator. During participant file reviews LPA and LPM was not able to locate medical assessment for all 10 participants. The Administrator stated that the facility staff request copies from the participants. However the participant do not always release that information. During inspection, the Administrator showed LPA and LPM their intake and staff case notes which showed that this was being completed, however the medical assessments were not performed by a licensed physician. In addition the facility did not have the clients ambulatory status on file.\n\nAt 12:40 PM LPA Valenzuela and LPM Mendoza reviewed 10 staff files which were complete. However LPA and LPM discovered that several staff members were not fingerprint cleared. It was later learned that they provided staff files that did not work for the above licensed facility. The facility keeps staff files for the whole region, and not just of the licensed facility, which made it difficult for LPA Valenzuela and LPM Mendoza to conduct an adequate staff file review. LPA Valenzuela and LPM Mendoza advised facility going forward to provide staff files for the above licensed facility only. LPA Valenzuela and LPM Mendoza reviewed an additional 5 staff files, which all staff were fingerprint cleared and all staff files were complete. Please note HR employee was out today, 05/24/22. LPA was unable to obtain an updated LIC 500. LPA requested the facility to submit a copy to LPM Mendoza via mail no later than Friday 5/27/22. The facility is currently in the process of changing administrators and will submit all required correct documents to CCL once they confirm who they will designate. LPA was not able to interview staff due to the time consumption of the Staff and Participant file reviews. Facility cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 86069(a) and 86069(b)(4): Participant Medical Assessments. In addition, Two Technical Violations were issued. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report was emailed to the Administrator.",

Staff have stated they were not aware of some reported incidents until months after they occurred or after the adult client was moved into another apartment. It does appear that some incidents did rise to the level of a safety concern that were addressed, but it is not clear that it was addressed in a timely manner. This was also the case related to meeting the client\u2019s needs. The question is whether or not they were met in a reasonable amount of time. LPA was able to interview the adult client\u2019s roommate but the adult client in the complaint did not return multiple requests to discuss complaint allegations. The adult roommate provided conflicting information from what was stated in the complaint. Based on 4 confidential interviews, one witness\u2019 not participating in an interview, staff notes, information provided in incident reports related to the complaint allegations, inconsistencies in statements and documentation as well as the lack of corroboration, the allegations are determined to be UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Please refer to the confidential names list LIC811 dated November 4, 2020. LPA Raissi and Tran interviewed (C1) on September 30, 2020 and October 1, 2020. Then LPA Raissi interviewed two staff members (S1 and S2) on October 7th-15th of 2020 via Zoom. LPA Raissi obtained a copy of the C1 Lease agreement, C1\u2019s needs and service plan, and the Shared Living Agreement (SLA) which details agency, Holly Place\u2019s no pet policy. Regarding the allegation, client denied service animal, LPA Raissi had a telephone interview with S2 on October 15, 2020. S2 told C1 on September 29, 2020 that there should be a meeting with management and C1 to address the matter of having an Emotional Support Animal (ESA). S2 was told by (THPP) agency that animals were not allowed by the landlord. S2 notified management and a meeting was scheduled to review. Based on interview with S1 on October 8, 2020 and S2 on October 15, 2020, clients can have an ESA. Agency is looking to implement into their policy for future clients. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore, LPA Raissi have found this complaint was unsubstantiated as C1 was approved to have an ESA. No citation was given. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was emailed to Ron Dhillon. LPAs Raissi and Tran requested that a copy of the findings be signed and sent back to LPA Tran (AmyLe.Tran@dss.ca.gov).",

During the course of the investigation, LPA Bertoli interviewed participants, staff, and welfare worker, and reviewed documentation. The participant who was the alleged victim (see LIC 811 dated 3/29/22) had indicated that they would provide names, pictures, and text messages to corroborate the occurrence of the incidents, but none was provided despite multiple requests. This evidence was also requested by the Welfare Worker, and nothing was produced. None of the other persons interviewed had knowledge or evidence of the alleged incidents. A fight did occur at the participant's unit between C1 and C2, but there was no other indication of the related allegations occurring, aside from the statements of C2. LPA Bertoli was unable to determine if Case Managers allowed bullying of participants, or didn't meet participants' needs, or if the complex was unsafe, or if they failed to treat participants with respect.

LPA met with Jose Alvarado, House Parent (HP1) who granted access to the facility. The facility is licensed to care for a capacity of 74 Non-minor Dependents. LPA requested and obtained a copy of the LIC500 along with the client roster for Department records. On 6/11/2025, LPA Nancy O\u2019Connell and Licensing Program Manager (LPM), Kevin Sauk received an email from the facility Interim Board President (BP), Lorie Vos, communicating that the facility no longer has a Facility Administrator (FA), effective 6/11/25. LPM Sauk immediately requested additional information related to a plan for proposed coverage while a new FA is hired and/or trained. On 6/16/25, the BP submitted a \u201ctransition plan\u201d that included proposed coverage for an interim FA to be completed by HP1. LPA O\u2019Connell conducted a thorough review of the submitted documents for HP1. Based on category specific regulations listed in California Code Regulation, TITLE 22, DIVISION 6, CHAPTERS 1 and 7, General Licensing Regulation, the Facility Administrator must meet education and/or experiential requirements and have the knowledge of the requirements for providing the type of care and supervision needed by clients\u2026\u201d, and \u201c\u2026the ability to comply with applicable law and regulation.\u201d Additionally, all Transitional Housing Placement Program (THPP) administrators must complete additional training related to sexual and reproductive rights of children in fostercare. Based on review of HP1\u2019s documentation along with an interview of HP1, there is no previous supervisor work history of oversight of regulatory responsibilities within a position previously held. Further, HP1 does not currently meet training requirements related to sexual reproductive health rights for THPP administrators. Due to these reasons, the Department was unable to approve HP1 as an interim FA for the facility.\n\nFurther, LPA O\u2019Connell conducted a review of records for clients in care for C1, C2, C3, C4 , C5 and C6 (See Confidential names list, dated 7/22/25, for names).

C4- there were 0 NSPs due at the time of inspection and 0 on file. C5- there were 0/7 NSPs on file since admission. C6-there is 1/8 NSPs on file and signed since admission. Upon interview. HP1 reported that he does not have knowledge of the former Administrator's process for completion of NSPs. HP1 was informed of regulatory requirement, which he agreed to and acknowledged.
