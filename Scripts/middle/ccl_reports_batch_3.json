    "narrative": "Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment.\n\nBased on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Devorah Weiss.",

    "narrative": "Minors are not treated with dignity Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements that clients must leave the bathroom door ajar while using the restroom. Some confidential interviews reported that the clients did not have to leave the door open while using the restroom and other interviews stated that clients must leave the bathroom door ajar while using the restroom. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff are to ensure that the clients keep the bathroom door ajar when using the restroom. Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content.\n\nMinors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment. Based on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations.

    "narrative": "On October 6, 2022, at 10:15 AM Licensing Program Analysts (LPA's) Lucero Jauregui, Eduardo Barragan and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Ann Valenzuela conducted an announced annual facility inspection. LPA's and LPM met with Margaret Gutgselll, Clinical Program Director who provided LPA's and LPM with a guided tour of the facility both indoors and outdoors. On February 23, 2023 at 9:00 AM LPA Lucero Jauregui returned to the facility to amend report. The facility is a four-bedroom four bathroom (for client use) in this two story home. The first floor consists of staff office, bedrooms (one, two, three and four), group therapy room, school room, dining room, kitchen, laundry room/nurse station and a two car garage that will be used as an Art Therapy room instead of garage. Bedrooms two and three will serve one client each and bedrooms one and four will serve two clients each. All beds were observed with appropriate clean linens, pillows, comforters, and mattresses in good repair. There are two upper wings to the facility which house the Program Director\u2019s office on the upper right wing and two therapy offices on the upper left wing. There are two additional separate buildings on the grounds, one is a three-car garage that has been transformed into a gym for residents and the other is the pool house. The pool house will remain locked and will only be used for storage, clients will not have access to the pool house. The Gym for residence will be locked as well. A physical plant inspection was completed and included the following checks: Facility grounds are clean and free of debris and observable hazards. There is adequate indoor and outdoor activity space. Sports equipment/toys/books/games were observed for children\u2019s recreation time. All facility smoke detectors and CONTINUED...\n\ncarbon monoxide detectors are in appropriate working order; fire extinguisher is properly charged and serviced. The hot water temperature was measured in the main bathroom and is currently 111.0 degrees which is in ration. Facility has cameras in common areas of the facility (27 cameras were noted on the premies of this facility.) Facility has a pool which is appropriately fenced and secured with a mesh fence. The enclosure was measured to be 5 feet with a self-latching gate that swings outward. Per facility staff, no firearms or weapons are allowed in the facility. LPA observed the following items posted Personal Rights, Grievance Procedures, Visitation Policy, Facility sketch, Activity Schedule, Menu, Staff Schedule and Emergency Plan. However a deficiency was observed with the medications. LPA's observed and took a video of multiple medications that were transferred between containers and were pre-packaged for multiple days in advance. Prior to inspection LPA's and LPM reviewed personnel files to ensure they contained all required documentation per Title 22 Regulations. Clinical Program Director advised that all client records will be kept electronically. All appropriate personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. All licensing fees have been paid and are current at this time. Given the contradiction of the medication guide and the ambiguity of being issued a citation and a technical violation for the same deficiency, the Department will dismiss the citation and uphold the two technical violations. A exit interview was conducted. A copy of the report was discussed and provided along with appeal rights to Margaret Gutgsell, Clinical Program Director.",

During this inspection, 10 out of 13 Residential Counselors and 5 out of 5 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of 13 Residential Counselors and 2 out of 5 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated March 26, 2024). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA L. Rogers observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Margaret Gutgsell, Program Director.",

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed that clients are required to conduct body checks multiple times a day. During a body check, clients remove one piece of clothing at a time, gives the clothing item to staff who then feels/checks the clothing for items of self-harm or contraband. Clients remove all clothing except their undergarments. When clients are dressed down to their underwear, they are then required to do three jump squats. Clients then re-dress. Three clients stated body checks are done each time they return from an outing and every night before they go upstairs to bed. Two staff stated that body checks are conducted the day of initial admission, each time clients return from an outing, and before going to bed. Staff report that all clients are required to conduct body checks for safety. The Program policy states that based on a physician\u2019s assessment and the individual needs of a client; body checks may be conducted. One client did not receive a medical assessment nor a treatment plan because they had only been at the facility for 3 days, and the client submitted to body checks. Although all the assessments had not been completed, the facility was within the timeline for completing them, including the Needs and Services Plan. Additionally, the client\u2019s parents signed admission paperwork outlining their policy, including the body checks. There were additional conflicting statements regarding under clothing that is expected to be worn during the body checks. There was conflicting information regarding statements made in the complaint narrative and from those interviewed for the complaint. Based on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the Allegation; Minor was not accorded dignity in their personal relationships with staff and other persons may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.",

The report also included information that C2 made comments to C1 which caused C1 emotional disturbance; however, facility staff did not report the information to C1\u2019s authorized representative. Regarding the allegation that staff did not prevent minor from engaging in inappropriate behaviors, a review of pertinent records revealed C2 had three incidents in April 2024 which involved making threats and attempting to engage in a physical altercation with clients in care. A confidential interview revealed C2 was taking medication that led to dysregulation and property damage. The confidential interview revealed C2 struggled to get along with peers, which would lead to confrontations, but did not reveal any physical incidents. A review of pertinent records and a confidential interview did not reveal any incidents in which C2 was found under a client\u2019s bed, however, there was a reported incident in which C1 left the facility on unauthorized leave after running out of the door. Regarding the allegation that facility staff did not prevent minor from making inappropriate comments towards other minors, a review of pertinent records revealed C2 made comments of wanting to harm clients in care which resulted in confrontation between clients. The review of pertinent records and a confidential interview both revealed staff engaged by intervening and deescalated the situations by creating separation between clients. A review of pertinent records and a confidential interview did not reveal any incidents in which C2 made comments to C1 which caused C1 emotional disturbance. Regarding the allegation that staff did not notify minor\u2019s parent of incidents, a review of pertinent records and a confidential interview revealed no incidents in which C2 was involved. The review of pertinent records revealed incidents that were reported regarding C1 involving other minors in care. A confidential interview revealed the facility provides notification to all necessary parties within 24 hours if involving law enforcement. Additionally, the confidential interview revealed that staff did not provide notification to authorized representatives of clients who were not involved in an incident, due to confidentiality reasons, but clients would sometimes share with others what happened in the facility, even if notification was not required.

Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment\n\nBased on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Devorah Weiss.",

Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. 3. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. 4. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. 5. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment Based on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "Minors are not treated with dignity Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements that clients must leave the bathroom door ajar while using the restroom. Some confidential interviews reported that the clients did not have to leave the door open while using the restroom and other interviews stated that clients must leave the bathroom door ajar while using the restroom. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff are to ensure that the clients keep the bathroom door ajar when using the restroom. Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment Based on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Brandi Ellis.",

Some confidential interviews reported that the clients did not have to leave the door open while using the restroom and other interviews stated that clients must leave the bathroom door ajar while using the restroom. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff are to ensure that the clients keep the bathroom door ajar when using the restroom. Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment Based on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Taylor Culbertson.",

All clients reported that they were allowed more time for showering and hygiene based on their progress in the program, but that even at the minimum amount of hygiene time allotted after admission was enough time to complete their hygiene routine. Both staff who were interviewed reiterated this, reporting that even if the kids ran out of time in the bathroom, they were still given time outside of the bathroom with a vanity mirror to complete any hygiene tasks they had left. Of the 5 clients who were interviewed regarding these allegations, all 5 clients reported to this agency that they felt safe at Evolve, they had staff they were comfortable confiding in if needed, and that none of them had experienced any sort of sexual harassment from staff or other clients during their stay. All clients interviewed stated that supervision was heavily enforced and that they were never out of sight from staff, except when using the bathroom or showering. This agency has investigated the allegations (1) \"Minor sexually harasses another minor;\" and (2) \"Minor not afforded sufficient time to perform personal care,\" and has found that although these allegations may be true or are valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated, based on LPA's inability to contact the clients named in the original complaint at the time it was received.

Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband.

Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment\n\nBased on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Devorah Weiss.",

    "narrative": "It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff are to ensure that the clients keep the bathroom door ajar when using the restroom. Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment.\n\nBased on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Devorah Weiss.",

The investigation revealed that a facility client was in a bathtub thrashing around, kicking his legs, throwing his arms around and hitting the bathtub with his fist along with trying to kick and hit staff with his fists. The client alleged that a staff, Reference #1, pulled his arm to restrain him during the incident causing an arm injury. Reference #1 stated that the client sustained the injury from hitting the wall with his left fist and denied intentionally hurting the client when he assisted the client out of the bathtub during the episode. Another staff who assisted with the client during the episode denied witnessing Reference #1 physically abuse the client. Confidential documents obtained ruled the injury as accidental.

The investigation revealed that the witness did not recall the incidents or the name of the perpetrator, although the witness continued to allege that they were hit and cursed at. The investigation revealed that CPS found the allegations to be Inconclusive. Bakersfield Police Department was unable to determine if an offense occurred due to conflicting statements and Ref. #2 having a history of making false accusations. A review of records indicates that Ref. #1 has a history of threatening staff, engaging in inappropriate attention seeking and actions of self-harm.

The allegations are, therefore, found to be substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Section 84072 (d) Personal Rights and for violation of Section 84072 (6)(A) Personal Rights.

It was reported to LPA that there has been a client that has been sleeping on the couch for a week and the minor does not want to sleep in the room. Confidential interviews revealed that clients would sleep in their room and there has been a few situations where clients would request to sleep on the couch due to reasons related to trauma. It was indicated in interviews that staff would encourage the clients to sleep in their room but if a client refuses, staff will continue to redirect until the transition is comfortable for the client. Interviews revealed that staff do not force clients to sleep on the couch and it would be the client that would ask to sleep on the couch if they felt uncomfortable in their room.

LPA met with Facility Manager Mark Pons and informed of the purpose of the visit. The CARES Inspection Tool was used to conduct the inspection. The facility and grounds are clean, well-maintained, and free of obstructions. There are no bodies of water, and there are no firearms on the premises, per Facility Manager. Food is within date and in a quantity to meet the needs of residents in care. Room temperature and hot water temperature measured within permitted range, at 72 F and 105.1 F, respectively. Residents have individual beds with clean linens and mattress pads. Confidential interviews were conducted with both present staff. Residents were at school, and 3 of 4 are nonverbal. Facility, staff, and resident records were inspected and observed to be complete. The following items need to be addressed: 1) Resident R4 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 12/14/21) file contained an incomplete LIC 405 Record of Client's/Resident's Safeguarded Cash Resources. R4 receives county funding, which is not separated into a separate P&I fund as with Regional Center. However, LPA advises, per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Section 80070, that cash resources similarly be logged on the LIC 405 to ensure that record is maintained. 2) Resident R3 file had a psychotropic medication, Trazodone, that was logged on the standard Medication Administration Record (MAR - LIC622A) rather than the Psychotropic MAR (PMAR - LIC622B). The facility did already have a psychotropic medication consent form signed by authorized representative. The log was otherwise complete and properly maintained. LPA advises, per CCR, Title 22, Section 84070, that the facility begin using the PMAR for this medication starting January 2022 so as to avoid confusing the records. 3) Resident records did not contain documentation of shared bedrooms. LPA advises, per CCR, Title 22, Section 84087, that the facility document whenever a bedroom is shared to ensure the arrangement is compatible and to maintain this documentation in the file of each resident sharing a bedroom.\n\nThere are no citations. Three advisories were issued per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80070 Client Records, 84070 Children's Records, and 84087 Buildings and Grounds. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left with Facility Manager Mark Pons, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

Information obtained shows that the client and staff engaged in a close-up conversation and the staff handed the client an unidentified object. The client took the item and placed it in his pocket and then went into the living room area for a brief time. The client then placed the item towards his mouth area and the object proceeded to illuminate. The client returned to the area where the staff was and handed the item in question back to the staff.

During the inspection, LPA Segura met with facility manager Taos Vargas and inspected the facility inside and out. Note due to COVID19 mitigation efforts, this inspection occurred via Microsoft Teams. LPA reviewed 3 child/client files prior to the inspection. The facility currently has in placement four children who are part of the child welfare system; however, only three of those children are subscribed psychotropic medication. In the course of reviewing the client documents, LPA Segura discovered the facility Quarterly and Annual reports are not signed by the authorized representative. The facility uses these two documents to meet the requirements of the Need and Services Plan. LPA interviewed the facility manager, Taos Vargas, via the MS Teams from 8:45-9:15 then interviewed the other facility manager Beth Toco at 9:15am to 9:30am. LPA Segura then requested to conduct a medication count. Beth assisted with the medication counts for the three clients taking psychotropic medications. The medication count was quick due the facility using a pharmacy that bubble packs medication. One issue LPA detected in the course of the medication count for C1 (Client 1, see confidential names list dated 02/25/2021) was that it appears the pharmacy indicates there are more pills than are placed in the bubble pack. Continued on 812c\n\nFor example the pharmacy sticker states there are 62 pills in the refill; however, they only bubble packed 56 (28 days in February times 2). After this part of the inspection concluded. LPA requested for Mr. Vargas to submit proof of psychotropic medication training for both himself and Beth. LPA conducted an exit interview with Taos Vargas, the facility administrator at 3:30pm and provided a summary report upon completion. Appeal rights were discussed and a copy of their rights provided. No deficiencies are being cited at this time. LPA Segura sent this report via email requesting a signature.",

LPA Segura reviewed Client files on 02/18/2021, 02/19/2021 and 02/23/2021 for C1, C2 and C3 respectively (Client 1, 2, 3 see confidential names list LIC 811 dated 03/02/2021). In the course of reviewing the client files, LPA Segura noted that none of the court authorizations for the three clients were current. LPA was unable to determine from the file review why current JV220s were not maintained in the client files. LPA did note that there was a copy of a JV220 transmittal for C3 dated 09/09/20; however, the court approval was not in the file. LPA was copied on emails sent by the administrator Yuka Ono requesting JV220s on 02/25/2021 from the client's social workers. As of todays inspection the JV223 for C3 is the only JV223 received from the county social workers. LPA conducted an exit interview with Taos Vargas, the facility administrator at 2:30pm and provided a summary report upon completion. Appeal rights were discussed and a copy of their rights provided.

    "narrative": "At 3:25PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont traveled to the home above for the purpose of conducting an unannounced Case Management - Deficiencies inspection. LPA met with Staff Lilibeth Toco, who helped facilitate this inspection. Currently in care are 6 ambulatory clients. On 08/27/2021, the San Jose Children's Residential Program Regional Office received a complaint for Heiwa House 2 with one allegation: \"Staff member inappropriately restrained resident causing injuries.\" This complaint was assigned to LPA Fremont on 09/01/2021. On 09/02/2021, LPA Fremont traveled to the facility to open this complaint and notify the Licensee of this allegation. On the evening of 09/02/2021, LPA Fremont received a phone call from Licensee/Administrator Yuka Ono, who was informing LPA Fremont that Heiwa House 2 is no longer operating as a Children's Residential Program Group Home and has now transitioned into an Adult Residential Facility (ARF). Upon investigation of the home's facility file and facility profile on the statewide server, LPA Fremont could not find any record or documentation of this transition. LPA contacted the home's new LPA, Alicia Delmundo of the Oakland Office Adult and Senior Care Program, and was informed by LPA Delmunod that the home completed their application process and was issued a new Adult Residential Facility license on 02/01/2021. LPA Delmundo also forwarded to LPA Fremont an email they had sent to the licensee on 06/25/2020. In this email, LPA Delmundo explained to the licensee that since the facility was licensed as a Group Home at that time, when their new license was granted for the Adult Residential Facility, the license for the group home needed to be forfeited simultaneously. (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C)\n\nLPA Fremont was not notified of this transition until after the home's new license was issued, and the home has since been operating on two separate CCL licenses, a Group Home License and an Adult Residential Facility license. Based on this information, the Licensee did not report an organizational change to the Licensing Agency within 10 days of its occurrence. A deficiency is being cited per Title 22 Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80061(e)(1) - Reporting Requirements. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. For this deficiency, the Licensee was issued a Plan of Correction of forfeiting their Group Home license to LPA. This POC was fulfilled during this inspection. Because the facility is no longer operating as a Children's Residential Group Home, LPA Fremont confirmed that LPA Delmundo has received this same complaint for the new Adult Residential license, and LPA Delmundo will be investigating the allegation going forward. Due to the above-mentioned details of the home's transition to an Adult Residential Facility, this complaint for the home's Group Home License will be closed without investigation. This agency has determined that although this allegation may have happened or is valid, the allegation \"Staff member inappropriately restrained resident causing injuries\" is determined to be unsubstantiated at this time pending further investigation by LPA Delmundo, because it was reported under the wrong facility license and therefore will require further investigation by the home's new LPA under their new program license. At this time, one deficiency is being cited. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided and discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to Licensee/Administrator Yuka Ono and Staff Lilibeth Toco, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Administrator/Licensee Alfredo Bonifacio and informed of the purpose of visit. Safety precautions were taken, including mask-wearing and pre-visit screening call. LPA used the CARE Inspection Tool to conduct the inspection. The facility is a single-story house in a residential neighborhood. There are 4 resident bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. All rooms are single-occupancy, and all beds have clean linens. There are no hazards or bodies of water. There are no firearms on the premises, per Administrator/Licensee.

All residents are nonverbal. The following deficiencies were found. See attached LIC 809-Ds and LIC 9102s. - Resident R1's (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) medication administration record (MAR) was not consistent with medication label. Medication Risperidone label reads \"Take 3 and one-half tablet,\" and the MAR reads \"4 tabs.\" There is a conservator-signed psychotropic medication consent form dated 7/30/21 that authorizes 4 tablet dosage. The quarterly report indicates 4 tablets as well. LPA is issuing an advisory of California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Section 84075 Health Related Services. - Resident R2 and R3 have no psychotropic medication consent form.

There is no plan dated within the last 6 months that is signed by authorized representative. LPA is issuing a citation of CCR, Title 22, Section 84068.2 Needs and Services Plan. - Residents R2, R3, and R4's needs and services plans, or behavior/treatment plans, are older than 6 months. LPA is issuing a citation of CCR, Title 22, Section 84068.3 Modifications to Needs and Services Plan. - Staff training hours meet requirements, but annual training record for 2021 does not indicate all staff attended a training on psychotropic medications. LPA is issuing an advisory of CCR, Title 22, Section 84065 Personnel Requirements. - Staff S1 and S2 (See LIC 811) are not listed on the Guardian roster printed this morning.

The purpose of the inspection was to deliver the findings of the above complaint allegations. During the investigation, LPA Karkazis conducted confidential interviews with staff members. All clients at this facility are nonverbal. Therefore, LPA was unable to interview clients. However, LPA Karkazis conducted interviews with authorized representatives. In addition, LPA Karkazis obtained and reviewed documentation that pertained to the above allegations. On August 11, 2022, there was a staff note stating that (S3) (see Confidential Names form (LIC 811) dated 9/7/2022, was informed by House Manager (S4) that direct care worker (S5) had locked a client in their bedroom using a child safety lock on the outside of his door. Based on interviews, it was learned that the (S5) had difficulty with the client\u2019s behavior and made an error in judgment. In addition, LPA obtained a copy of the incident report dated August 18, 2022, mentioning that a direct care worker (S5) used a child safety lock on a client\u2019s bedroom door. On August 12, 2022, the staff member was terminated. Based on interviews and physical evidence, it was determined that the Staff locked the minor in the minor's bedroom, and the minor had an inappropriate locking device on the outside of the minor's bedroom door.

During the inspection, facility records and the GH program statement was reviewed.

Specifically, C1 attempted to aggress upon C2 but S1 placed themself between C1 and C2. C1 evaded around S1 towards C2. S1 then put C1 in a manual restraint for 46 seconds while staff 2 (S2) assisted C2 from the dining room to the medication room to maintain separation from C1.

C1 informed this LPA that he felt that his rights were violated and he was the victim of racial and religious based descrimation. However S1, S2 and S3 deny these allegations.

Facilty staff placed the tea on the coffee table located in the living room and proceeded with his normal work duties. The facilty administrator stated that the client tends to eat and drink other people\u2019s stuff and staff have redirected him many times. Interviews with staff revealed that client was in his room getting ready for bed and may have stepped out of his room to walk around the house and might have seen the cup and drank it when no one was looking. Client is non-verbal. Staff stated that no one heard the client scream or make noises from the injury. Staff stated that there was no observation from the night staff of any possible injuries to client because client might have gone to his room after the incident and went to sleep. Staff stated that visual checks are done during the day and night and the client's lights were off. The facility administrator stated that a morning staff observed redness on clients face when he woke up and contacted him to report the injuries. The facility administrator reported that he immediately took client to urgent care where it was determined client had first degree burns to the middle of upper chest, second degree burns to the bottom lip, chin and right side of his cheek. Therefore, the facility administrator interviewed night staff and terminated that a staff was at fault of leaving his hot tea cup unattended causing negligence on his part. In addition, another night staff that was working the night shift the day of the incident and was unaware as to how the client sustained the injuries because he was attending to the other clients. The facility client was non-verbal and had a history of exhibiting inappropriate behaviors. Based on the information gathered, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was met, therefore the allegation is substantiated per California Code of Regulations Title 22 \u2013 refer to LIC9099-D for deficiencies and a civil penalty of $150 will be assessed in conjunction with the confirmed deficiency.

Staff denied the allegations. The investigation revealed Ref. #1 was unable to obtain a laptop that was in a secure location. Ref. #1 then walked to his room, walked out and obtained a phone to make a call. Staff told Ref. #1 he needed to ask for permission to use the phone. Ref. #1 immediately escalated in self injurious, aggressive behavior and was ushered to a nearby room to stabilize. Staff reported Ref. #1 bit himself on the wrist, spit at staff, cursed at staff and lunged at a staff\u2019s legs. As a result of Ref. #1 presenting with behaviors, staff reported using a Two Person Hold to guide Ref. #1 down to a mat and while he was on the floor used Three to Five Second Holds up to four times within a ten to fifteen-minute time frame. After the incident a body check was conducted and Ref. #1 was observed with redness and marks on his neck, stomach and back. A red mark on Ref. #1 neck, staff suggested, could have been obtained from a two-way radio device that was clipped to his collar. The marks on Ref. #1 back, staff suggested, could have been obtained from a police belt worn by Ref. #1 and his body\u2019s movement while on the floor. Statements obtained by staff regarding the use of restraint were consistent. Staff reported utilizing holds as they were trained, to ensure the safety of the resident and staff. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted revealed insufficient facts related to the reported incident. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with placing agency workers revealed there were no concerns related to the incident or the allegations reported to the Department. Based on information obtained through interviews conducted and records review, the allegations are Unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "Attached to the letter was facility's neighborhood complaint policy and LPA's business card. To date, no neighbor has communicated with LPA. Witnesses interviewed by LPA stated child(ren) are left outside in the backyard and heard crying and moaning, early in the morning about 6:00 a.m. Witnesses(es) stated they saw this over a fence top, and it looked as though staff was not providing a distressed child(ren) access to the home and that the child was outside alone. On 11-6-2020, LPA observed the location(s) in the backyard where someone looking onto the property, may not see, because their view could be blocked by a storage shed. LPA observed different locations in the yard where staff situate themselves to maintain supervision. Based on a staff interview, staff maintain close supervision, yet, provide a sibilance of privacy. Based on interviews from staff and former staff, children are always properly supervised. The needs and services plan/IPP of a child indicates the child is autistic, nonverbal, behaves in a self injurious manner, is destructive when escalated, punches walls and causes other property destruction. On 11-6-2020, LPA conducted a facility inspection wherein staff introduced the child to LPA. The child would not look at LPA, there was no eye contact, the child had a blank affect, did not talk, made grunting type noises and paced back and forth within the living area. LPA observed staff/child interaction. The child made waving hand gestures, held the staff's hand then sat on staff's lap. The child hugged and held onto staff. The child began flapping his arms about and jumped up and down. Staff told LPA that the child may be fretful because of the new person in the home (LPA). LPA observed staff interventions and they attempted to keep the child from escalating using soothing actions and words. (Staff helped the child put on shoes then took the child for a drive.)\n\nBased on interviews conducted and based on evidence reviewed/obtained, the allegation that staff do not allow a child access to the home is conflicting. Interviews of current and former group home staff, NBRC staff and biological parents indicate that a child's high level of needs and challenging behaviors are problematic and challenging for the professionals and parents alike. That challenge is acerbated by an apparent inability of the child to communicate needs. According to the evidence obtained, noises that witness(es) heard could be sounds the child makes on a day to day basis and in line with the child's normal actions whether or not the child is distressed. However, there is credible evidence which is conflicting in that witnesses observed/heard what could appear as neglectful and a lack of supervision on more than one occasion. Although the allegation may be true, there is not a preponderance of evidence to substantiate. The allegation is therefore UNSUBSTANTIATED. LPA Eunice delivered this finding virtually to Momo Duoa on November 17, 2020. This report was discussed and delivered in this manner due to COVID-19 pandemic health and safety reasons. LPA conducted an exit interview and provided appeal rights.",

In the kitchen, LPA observed at least the minimum requirement of two days of perishable foods.

    "narrative": "During LPA's interview with Administrator, she explained to LPA that there were new issues with C1's insurance which inhibited the facility's ability to schedule an appointment with psychiatry to establish care and refill prescriptions for C1. Administrator made made many follow-up calls and attained different records to attempt to get the issues resolved, to no avail. C1's medications ran out on 4/29/2024, and on 5/1/2024 Administrator obtained a 10-Day emergency supply. The Administrator informed LPA that they did not obtain this sooner as they thought the coverage would go through before that. Afterwards, the issue was resolved and an appointment was scheduled for 5/23/2024. However, with the knowledge that C1's appointment was not until 5/23/2023, on 5/12/2024 after the 10-day emergency supply of medication ran out, C1 was again without medication until 5/15/2024. An emergency supply was obtained on 5/16/2024 and C1 resumed medications as normal. While the Administrator was diligent in following up with the relevant parties in completing all tasks required to attain a doctor's appointment to establish care for C1, and to then attain prescribed medications, there were two lapses in medications being provided to C1 in which emergency medication supplies were not attained timely, resulting in a total of six days of missed medication. Additionally, during LPA's inspection on 6/20/2024, LPA conducted a review of C1\u2019s medications. LPA found that for two medications (M1 and M2), there were 20 pills in the bottle, 30 originally prescribed, and eight marked as taken, leaving 2 pills unaccounted for for both. Administrator checked with the Facility Manager and the Medication Administration Records added up correctly, however there was no explanation for four the unaccounted for pills. CCL and the authorized representative did not receive an incident report for both missed medication events (4/29/2024 and 5/12/2024) until 6/12/2024, after the Regional Center Service Coordinator brought to the Administrator's attention that an incident report needed to be submitted. The Administrator informed LPA that with everything going on she failed to create and send the incident reports as required. Based on LPA's observations and conducted interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1 Sections 80078(a) and 80061(b)(1)(E)&(f), are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.

S3 exited from the same window and continued redirecting while following client from behind as client returned inside the facility. Client was able to calm down after continued redirection by S3 and another staff on duty (S4). Other staff (S4) involved denied failing to intervene and denied yelling at clients. S4 was supervising two other clients present in another area at the facility while client was escalated and under supervision of S3 inside client\u2019s bedroom. S4 observed S3 redirecting and following client; S4 denied witnessing S3 hit client. S4 assisted S3 in redirecting client after client returned inside the facility. S4 denied yelling at clients in placement. During LPA\u2019s interviews with clients and additional staff, the client (C1) who was escalated was unable to address the allegations. C1 responded by repeating the same questions asked by LPA to LPA. Another client (C2) reported witnessing the allegations but during interviews gave varying accounts of what happened. The other client (C3) in placement reported not witnessing the incident due to being asleep. Other staff interviewed were not able to address the allegations; they were not working when the incident happened.

The purpose of the inspection was to discuss concerns regarding the group home accepting a new placement in the facility that requires injectable hormones. Donna explained that the youth was an emergency placement by VMRC. According to Donna, VMRC stated that they would be assigning a nurse to administer the shots to the youth, but once the youth got placed this did not happen. In the meantime, the youth's family members who are doctors are coming in and administering the shots, which is a problem too, as the youth has been exhibiting behavioral episodes. Donna also expressed concerns with the conflicting information being received by the different parties involved. LPM Krage reminded Donna that VMRC regulations differ from those of Community Care Licensing (CCL) and although it might not be a violation of the VMRC regulations, it is not in the facilities program to accept youth that need injectable medications. LPM Krage also informed Donna that the facility staff cannot be trained to administer the injections because it is outside of the scope of their training. LPM Krage also addressed other concerns regarding the facility and administrator qualifications and informed Donna that she will address these concerns with the regional manager Nelson Martinez. LPM Krage and LPA Tinoco asked Donna to keep the department informed of any changes or new information as it becomes available regarding this youth. Donna understood and agreed to keep the department updated. Due to COVID-19 An exit interview was conducted over the phone, and a copy of the report was provided to the facility via email. Signatures were also requested via email and will be documented on an LIC812.",

Staff placed the resident on the hardwood floor of the bedroom, and when staff returned, they found a toy car near the resident that had not been present before. The door was closed to prevent other residents from entering the resident's bedroom.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss a recent complaint and the facility's compliance history. In attendance representing the licensing agency were Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Isabel Diego and Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins, and representing the licensee were Administrator Jane Gano and Facility Manager Mariel Pablo. On 10/15/24, the Department of Social Services, Community Care Licensing Division concluded an investigation into the allegations that a child sustained an unexplained injury while in care and that facility staff did not ensure adequate care and supervision was provided to a child in care. The investigation found that non-ambulatory and non-verbal child C1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) sustained an arm fracture during a lapse in supervision. C1's care plan and Regional Center case manager indicated that C1 required one to one (1:1) supervision wherein one staff member provides direct care to solely C1. The investigation found that while the supervising staff member was aware of this requirement, they left C1 unattended for a period of approximately 5 minutes in C1's bedroom with the door closed. During this time, C1 sustained a fracture of the right proximal humerus bone. On 10/15/24, the Department issued substantiated findings and a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84078, Subsection (b). The incident and the reason for closing the door were discussed as well as the actions that the licensee has taken to retrain staff and to meet with the Regional Center case manager to confirm staff retraining on C1's care needs. LPM and LPA also discussed the plan of correction developed on 10/15/24 and the licensee's satisfactory completion of the plan of correction. LPMand LPA also discussed the possibility of an assessment of civil penalties due to the nature of the incident and explained the civil penalty process.

Based on confidential interviews, observation, and record review, a client in care sustained injuries to the face and hands. The injuries were photographed and appeared to be minor. No witnesses observed the cause of the injuries, and the client is nonverbal. The client's care plan indicates the client has eczema and skin-picking behavior. No injuries had been observed by staff but once made aware of the injuries, the facility staff were prompt in their follow-up, including cleansing the client's injuries and speaking with identified potential witnesses. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, based on LPA\u2019s observations and interviews, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur.

Clients' medications are stored appropriately and medication administration records reflect correct administration. Staff have current first aid and crisis intervention training. All clients in care are nonverbal/non-conversational, so LPA did not conduct any client interviews. LPA did not conduct staff interviews due to time and staff being preoccupied with assigned job duties. LPA conducted observations of all clients and present staff.

Facility staff reportedly did not observe the bruising, but upon being made aware of the bruising, staff consulted medical professionals and took the client to the doctor for assessment.

Medical records show an MRI was ordered on 6/7/19, the MRI was re-ordered on 9/10/19, and a helmet and wheelchair were ordered on 9/10/19 as well. The MRI was completed on 11/27/19. A second follow-up MRI was re-ordered by Dr Boyd on 1/23/2020. Per Care Coordinator, the MRI ordered on 1/23/2020 was not completed as of 6/12/20. Further, an x-ray of client\u2019s right shoulder was ordered on 5/15/20, there is no record of an x-ray completed as of 6/12/2020. The client received a baseline EEG on 6/25/20 at Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland but was a no-show for the 1:00 pm appointment on 7/27/2020 in the neurology department. Staff confirmed the client\u2019s medical needs became greater than the facility could met, therefore a plan to relocate the youth was initiated. Staff stated the youth wore a protective helmet when reminded by staff. Medical records indicate the following occurred: on 12/14/19 skin above the eyebrow was glued after a cut from a fall and on 1/10/20 youth received 2 staples to the head; both incidents occurred at school. On 5/15/20 medical care was sought for right shoulder pain after a fall, an x-ray was order but youth did not go to the appointment. On 6/2/20 youth required 6 staples to the head after falling in the facility. On 1/23/20 Dr. Boyd ordered a new helmet for better protection. As of 6/12/20 records indicate C1 last received a helmet in September 2019. Based on interviews conducted and medical records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the allegations that staff did not follow up on medical appointments and the proper care was not provided are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. The facility is cited under Title 22 Group Homes, Division 6, Chapter 5, Section 84072(d) - Personal Rights and Section 84078 - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. An exit interview was conducted with Rhonda Reid. A copy of this report and of the Appeal Rights are being provided to the facility.",

It was confirmed that in December 2022 an incident occurred in which a staff member took a client to their family gathering. However, it was also verified that this incident took place at a different facility, where the staff member was employed and the client resided at the time, not at the above facility. In addition, LPA was unable to confirm or deny instances of staff taking clients to their home to complete labor, or the client doing any labor while at the family gathering. Also, the investigation was unable to prove or disprove that the facility staff were being discouraged from and not reporting incidents in a timely manner. LPA could not confirm details regarding incidents, or dates of the incidents, which were not being reported. Also, the facility confirmed that there were no formal complaints from staff regarding them being discouraged from reporting and all staff interviewed stated they felt they could report incidents. Lastly, LPA could not determine whether staff mismanaged clients\u2019 money and then falsified minors\u2019 records. LPA could not establish a time frame in which clients\u2019 money was allegedly mismanaged causing staff to falsify the related documentation. Also, a record review did not show any errors in client funds or any missing receipts during the time frame of March 1, 2025, to May 7, 2025. Although the allegations may have happened or may be valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "During interviews with staff, AD stated that C1 did not share much information but did name S1 as the staff who had bent their thumb back and was the staff who had placed their knee on C1 during a containment. Staff S1 stated they only worked with C1 maybe about 3 times and did recall one day in particular that C1 had alot of behavior episodes. However, S1 stated they have never placed C1 in a containment before and denied having bent C1\u2019s thumb or placing their knees on C1. Staff S2 who was present during this shift stated that at no point was C1 placed in a containment. S2 stated that S1 did not injure C1 and did not witness S1 bending C1\u2019s thumb or placing their legs/knees on C1\u2019s body. In an interview with BB, they stated that C1 reported that a male staff had placed their knee on C1 but that C1 did not provide a name or provide details of the event. LPA attempted to interview C1 twice but C1 refused to speak to LPA. During review of the police report, C1 refused to be interviewed by local law enforcement officers. In reviewing C1's file, although C1 had previous containment incidents prior to the date of this allegation, none involved the staff S1. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. No title 22 regulations were cited during today\u2019s inspection. Exit interview conducted and a copy of this report along with Appeal Rights was emailed to Najon Saina, Administrator, with a request for the report to be signed and returned electronically to LPA.",

When discussing restraints with the clients, staff and other individuals, the youth are restrained only when they are a danger to themselves or other individuals in the home, it is a last resort and other de-escalation techniques have failed. A copy of Kavere Services Emergency Interventions Plan is located within the Program Statement which outline the use of restraints. The Reporting Party (RP) was following up on the use of restrains to confirm whether it was against regulations, which was determined that the home can use restraints. This was determined by Pro Act training records, Program Statement, Emergency Intervention Plan, and confidential interviews. On December 27, 2023, C1 was restrained using the prone method (restrained person is on their stomach) by staff and the restrain lasted for five minutes and C1 had no marks. The reporting party stated that a second incident occurred on December 29, 2023, where the prone method was used again by staff and C1 was restrained for five minutes, and no marks were observed. Later the same day, December 29th, C1 was restrained again using the prone method by staff C1 was restrained for two minutes, released and no marks were observed. When clients are restrained, the staff is watching their breathing and talking with them. The reason C1 was restrained was due to self-harming and staff aggression. This agency has investigated the complaint regarding the above allegation. We have found that the complaint was Unsubstantiated, meaning that the allegation was false, could not have happened and/or is without a reasonable basis. No title 22 regulations were cited during today\u2019s inspection. A copy of this report and appeal rights were given to the agency.",

LPA attempted to interview C1 and Staff S1. LPA also obtained video recordings of the incident which took place. During an interview with the Reporting Party (TE), they stated that during a Zoom session with C1 who was in their own bedroom, loud banging noises was heard and then a staff (S1) was observed entering C1\u2019s bedroom. TE stated that this staff swung something that was in their hand towards C1. TE stated they are unsure if C1 was hit, but another voice outside the frame of the video was heard telling S1 to shut the laptop and C1 was heard saying \u201cno\u201d at the end right before the laptop was closed. During an interview with AD, they stated that they had questioned S1 about the incident. AD stated that per S1, S1 banged the pan on the wall as a scare tactic to be louder that C1 and did not hit C1 with the pan. In an interview with Staff S2 who was on shift the day of this incident, S2 stated that they observed S1 use a pan to bang on the wall, closet door, and bed. S2 stated that S1 did not use the pan to hit Client C1. S2 stated they had asked S1 to close the laptop so that S2 could calm both C1 and S1 down. LPA attempted interviews with Client C1 but C1 did not provide information regarding the incident and ended the interview after only a few minutes. After multiple attempts, LPA was unable to make contact with Staff S1 for an interview. LPA was able to obtain a copy of the Zoom Session recording for review. S1 was observed with a pan in their hand, held high in a strike-like motion. At the end of the video, S1 is observed swinging the pan down and hitting something before S1 closes C1\u2019s laptop. It is unclear what was hit. The recording showed evidence that the Staff S1 did not handle the situation or C1 appropriately during this incident. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

The bio-parents thought it was best for C1 not to be interviewed. C2 is non-verbal and LPA was unable to establish a rapport. C3 did not want to talk about being restrained. When discussing restraints with the staff and other individuals, the youths are restrained only when they are a danger to themselves or other individuals in the home, it is a last resort and other de-escalation techniques have failed. A copy of Kavere Services Emergency Interventions Plan is located within the Program Statement which outline the use of restraints. Staff conducted a body check on C1 and found several marks on C1\u2019s lower back and a small mark on C1\u2019s chin. Staff stated the injuries could have occurred before the restraint. C1 grabbed staff\u2019s glasses, started swinging on staff, biting, and grabbing staff. The Pro Act trainer reviewed the Incident Report dated 2/11/2023 and stated that the injuries could have occurred when C1 wedged himself between the bed and door. Staff interviewed stated they never put pressure to the back when doing a restraint. Based on the investigation, observation, records reviewed, and interviews conducted, the complaint findings are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

When LPA questioned FC1 about the inconsistency, FC1 declined any further response to the LPA\u2019s questions. Staff denied restraining FC1. Based on LPA\u2019s confidential interviews and documents reviewed, the allegation that Staff inappropriately restrained minor resulting in injuries is unsubstantiated, meaning that the allegation lacks a preponderance of evidence to prove that the violation occurred. Allegation 2. Staff inappropriately spoke to minor in care. It was alleged that S1 made inappropriate threats to FC1 during an altercation. FC1 did not recall the alleged statements when LPA interviewed FC1 on both occasions. Staff denied the alleged threats to FC1. Based on LPA\u2019s confidential interviews and documents reviewed, the allegation that Staff inappropriately spoke to minor in care is unsubstantiated, meaning that the allegation lacks a preponderance of evidence to prove that the violation occurred. Allegation 3. Staff refused to provide food to minor. During LPAs interview with FC1, FC1 stated that staff refused to provide a second helping of food to FC1. FC1 got angry and began to destroy things at the facility. S1 stated the FC1 never requested a second helping of food but began picking on FC2 while at the table and then directed his anger to staff once he got up from the table. S2 and S3 did not observe the incident but was later told of the incident by S1.

LPA conducted a walk-through of the facility with staff Noel Maldonado and observed the following: one dining area, kitchen, hallway, living room, two client bedrooms, two bathrooms, the garage, one staff office, and the backyard. The clients' bedrooms met requirements and had the necessary personal storage space, with clean, complete bedding. Clients had appropriate clothing, in reasonable quantities. One client's closet doors were off track and possibly needed to be repaired. The food at the facility met the standards for a minimum of 2 days perishable and 7 days non-perishable, with a variety of meals and snacks. The facility's menu was posted, as well as their activity plan. The carbon monoxide detector and smoke detector were tested and operational. There was no hot water sign indicating hot water above the coffee machine and water machine as required. There were three (roughly 4 inch) holes in the ground near the perimeter of the house in the backyard which need covers. There was one section of fencing in the backyard which staff stated was rotting due to the sprinkler, resulting in exposed rusty nails. The inside of the home was clean, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. The temperature inside the home was comfortable for clients, staff, and guests. The facility has a cordless phone on the premises for client use. Client files, money, and medications were locked up/inaccessible to clients as required.\n\nThe Board of Directors meets on at least a quarterly basis as required. The meeting notes were available to LPA to inspect. The board either did not discuss, or did not document, current complaints and incident reports reviewed for each facility. The facility is conducting fire and disaster drills at least quarterly for each shift as required. The facility's emergency disaster plan/mass casualty plan is complete, meeting all requirements. It had not been signed off on as having been reviewed however, since 10/2023. On this date, the Administrator reviewed and signed. The plan stated the facility will utilize an ice chest and \"blue ice\" to preserve any medications which require refrigeration in the event of a power outage, however the facility did not have an ice chest. One client was not able to communicate with LPA, and the other client did not want to speak to LPA on this date. LPA will attempt to speak with the client on another date. The staff files and training records are maintained at another one of the licensee's facilities, and due to the time, LPA could not review them on this date. LPA advised for the records to be present at this facility for when LPA returns to complete the annual. No citations were issued during today's inspection. LPA is issuing advisory notes, which are not citations. An exit interview was conducted with the Administrator, and a copy of this report was provided to her.",

All staff are trained with the additional 1 hour of Facility Manager Training. All staff have current Pro-Act Training for emergency interventions. All staff have received the required annual training hours. The Administrator's duties were missing from her file, which she put in the file during this inspection. All staff reviewed have had a Health Screening and TB test as required. All staff are qualified for their roles, and evidence of such was in their files as required. The facility has consultants who meet with the clients as required including BCBAs and interns, a Psychiatrist, and a Recreation Therapist. All staffs' First Aid and CPR are current. All staffs' drivers' licenses are current. LPA reviewed two client files and found: All client records are present, except for the signed discipline policy. Both clients' files have the required Needs and Services Plans, Immunizations, TB test, Cash Resources/records, Medication Administration Records, authorization from parents/guardians to take psychotropic medications, and identifying information. The Cash Resources Log for C2 was off by $2, due to staff missing the receipt saying $17 for a haircut that usually cost $15. This was corrected during this inspection.\n\nLPA interviewed one client, one staff, and the Administrator. Staff/Administrator were knowledgeable about the clients and facility practices. LPA advises staff be given a refresher on the Mandated Reporting process. No citations were issued. LPA issued Advisory Notes for Technical Violations, and these are not citations.

    "narrative": "At 9:05 AM Licensing Program Analysts (LPA) Isabel Mendoza made an unannounced inspection to this facility to conduct an annual required inspection. LPA met with Direct Care staff John Yap and Lead Staff Daisy Garcia. Shortly after Administrator Rochelle Rivera arrived. The facility currently has a census of 3 clients. All clients were in school during todays inspections. At 9:33 AM LPA and the Administrator toured the facility inside and out. The facility is clean, safe and sanitary and in good repair. All passageways are unobstructed. All disinfectants, cleaning solutions and poisons are locked in the laundry room. Per Administrator, there are no firearms in the facility. The kitchen is clean and sanitary. The facility has sufficient two day perishable and seven day nonperishable food supply. The inspected bedrooms were furnished accordingly. LPA noticed that two bedrooms (bedrooms 2 and 3) ceilings and walls had several stains/markings, so LPA advised the facility to do a good cleaning on the walls/ceiling. During inspection at 11:01 AM staff started wiping down the walls in both bedrooms. There is an outdoor space for the clients, and no hazards or broken items. The facility has another house/detachment which is separate from the facility. This area is prohibited from clients and is used by staff members/live-ins. LPA advised the facility to submit an updated fire clearance sketch and include the backyard detachment house. The facility will submit the sketch no later than 10/01/21. There are no pools or bodies of water. LPA inspected medications, and they appeared fine. Medications are located in the kitchen area [ PLEASE REFER TO LIC 809 C...]\n\nin a locked cabinet. All items are fully documented. LPA noticed that the facility was using MAR LIC 622 A for psychotropic medication. LPA gave a copy of LIC 622 B to the Administrator so the facility can separate non-psychotropic from psychotropic MARS per requirements. The facility ensured they will start incorporating the LIC 622B, and make all necessary changes. LPA Mendoza reviewed all three client files. All files were organized and had all required documents. LPA found a few items were documents were not fully complete, so LPA reminded the facility to ensure that all LIC forms must be completed and if an item does not apply to write \"N/A\". At 12:10 PM LPA inspected three staff files and (S1), (S2), and (S3) (Please refer to LIC 811, dated 09/17/21 for confidential names) did not have Health Screening or TB test results on file.

The Administrator (S4) certificate expired back in 2018 and the Administrator stated that she tried to renew it in 2019 but did not complete the correct administrator courses, so was unable to get it renewed. LPA obtained copies of all documentation that was submitted back in 2019. During inspection, the Administrator confirmed she is currently registered for a recertification class that will be on 09/22/21 and submitted proof to LPA. LPA went over Guardian association list that was printed on 09/16/21 with Administrator, and (S5) Daisy Garcia is not showing associated. The facility confirmed that (S5) has worked at the facility for about 5 months. During inspection, LPA obtained a copy of criminal record transfer request, which was submitted to CCL main office back in April. LPA advised the facility to resubmit form to CCL main office again, and LPA obtained a copy and will take back to the office for processing. LPA Mendoza also introduced Administrator to CCL's new background portal called Guardian. LPA obtained copies of LIC 500, LIC 610, LIC 309, and Administrative documents for Rochelle Rivera. Per Title 22 regulations, deficiencies were cited at this visit, and three LIC 9102 Technical Violations, and one Technical Assistance was issued.

During the visit, LPA conducted 1 staff interview with Administrator and observed footage from facility staff of the incident detailed in the incident report. In the footage, a staff member is shown restraining a resident in the prone position with their hands behind their back and with the staff member seated on top of the resident. Administrator initially stated she did not believe this was a restraint and confirmed that the program prohibits staff from performing restraints. LPA explained that this was a restraint and that it was prohibited in the plan of operation. LPA also discussed the dangers of the type of restraint performed and how it is a personal rights violation. Additionally, on 8/15/23, LPA requested a revised/supplemental report be submitted, as not all required information for the restraint incident was included in the original report. On 8/29/23, Administrator stated that no restraint was performed and so the requested information was not submitted to LPA, including the type of restraint used. Lastly, no correction or retraining of staff has been completed yet. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 84072 Personal Rights, 84365 Emergency Intervention Staff Training, 84061 Reporting Requirements, and 80022 Plan of Operation.

This amended report reflects the original findings that were previously reviewed with and signed by the facility on January 23, 2025. The report is now being issued as the official version. The investigation conducted by LPA K.Dear included confidential interviews, as well as a review of incident reports, supervision logs, and other relevant documentation. Concerning the supervision issues, both interviews and documents did not support the claim that staff failed to adequately monitor clients. The statements provided were inconsistent and lacked corroborating evidence. Additionally, the allegation that staff failed to intervene during peer altercations was not substantiated; both records and interviews indicated that staff responded appropriately to these incidents. Lastly, the claim that a staff member made an inappropriate comment to a minor could not be confirmed. The statements were conflicting, and no witnesses were able to verify the allegation. Based on the confidential interviews and review of documentary evidence collected by LPA K.Dear, the Department has decided that the allegations are",

Likewise it was determined that staff are not adhereing to the facility's runaway plan. Staff often waits in excess of an hour to report missing clients even though the runaway plan indicates that missing clients will be reported to law enforcement within 30 minutes. It was also determined that the facility had no clear plans for accompanying C1 to the hospital or supervising her while she was there.

Confidential interviews and personal observation revealed that the clients backpacks are cleaned out daily and the staff know to look for dirty clothes and food in backpacks. Other confidential interviews state that the clients would let the staff know if there was food sent home as they like to eat it. A confidential witness still maintains that the allegations are true. The allegation that facility staff did not ensure the group home child was adequately and cleanly dressed specifically refers to C1 having dried feces on sweat pants, C1 not wearing underwear, and that C1 has worn the same shorts twice in one week. Confidential interviews revealed that the clients clothes are washed if not daily every other day. Confidential interviews also revealed that while the staff lay the clothes out for C1 for the day C1 will dress self and that C1 owns three sets of the exact same shorts so it seems that C1 is wearing the same shorts more than once a week however they are a new clean pair of shorts. Other confidential interviews revealed that they have not seen C1 wear the same clothes more than once without being washed. A confidential witness still maintains that the allegations are true. The allegation that group home children are not being adequately supervised specifically refers to the sexualized behavior between C1 and C2. C1 is constantly trying to touch C2\u2019s butt and breasts and C1 will thrust pelvis at C2. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 and C2 have separate living rooms. When they are in the same room together there is always a staff member between them. None of the clients are allowed to sit on the same couch. All clients have their own bedrooms and no client is allowed in another client\u2019s room. The staff at night have a clear field of vision down the hallway and are able to monitor the clients. A confidential witness still maintains that the allegations are true. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegations that facility staff is not meeting C1\u2019s hygiene needs, facility staff did not ensure that C1 was adequately and cleanly dressed, and C1 and C2 are not being adequately supervised may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report and appeal rights were explained and given to House manager Jesse Lozano.",

At time of inspection LPA met with Direct care staff Andrea Bonilla. The facility was toured inside and out with Direct Care Staff Andrea Bonilla. The home is a one-story residence with four bedrooms and three bathrooms. One client was present at time of inspection. Bedrooms are arranged so that no more than one client is in a room, and there is one client per bed. There is adequate shelf and closet space for client\u2019s belongings. All hazardous items have been properly made inaccessible to areas where clients will have access. The medications were stored and locked in a cabinet in the Staff Office. Cleansers/chemicals are locked and stored in closet in hallway above Washing Machine. Sharp knives are inaccessible and stored in a locked cabinet in the Kitchen. The First Aid Kit is located in the staff office and contained all required supplies. The facility's smoke detectors in each bedroom were checked and were inoperable. The carbon monoxide detector located in living room and was inoperable. There are no guns or weapons in the facility as stated by Direct Care Staff Andrea Bonilla. LPA observed a minimum 7-day non-perishable and a 2-day perishable supply of food. There was a variety of snacks available for clients as well. The following required posted items were observed accessible to clients: Grievance Procedures, Personal Rights, Visitation policies, and current menu. The facility outside grounds was also inspected and it was observed to be clean and well maintained. Emergency exits were free from obstruction. Four of four client files were reviewed during the inspection and noted to have documents required per regulations in file. Four of four clients are non-verbal and therefore could not be interviewed.\n\nBased on the facility inspection and file reviews this date, there are two deficiencies being cited at this time. This inspection was not able to be completed on this day. LPA will return to complete day two of the annual inspection at a later date. A copy of this report and appeal rights was reviewed and given to Direct Care Staff, Michael Covarrubias.",

LPA\u2019s observation, interviews conducted, and records reviewed were inconsistent that facility staff did not prevent youths in care from engaging in physical altercations. The facility accepts clients with severe behavioral and mental health diagnosis, and most of the incidents and physical or verbal altercations in the facility stem from clients antagonizing one another. Clients interviewed reported they like residing at the facility, feel safe and that staff separate them during altercations, and ensure their needs are met. There is evidence that the two incidents which occurred on 09/10/2022 were addressed appropriately by staff on shift to ensure safety of all clients in care, when clients escalated and engaged in physical altercations with one another. The facility Program Statement states, \u201cWhen residents become engaged in physical altercations (fights) in which they do not respond to staff\u2019s verbal directives, staff may use physical interventions that include standing between the combative clients and/or physically breaking up the fight by holding back a client by his/her shoulders while verbally re-directing him/her.\u201d And \u201cIn cases where a client(s) \u2026 does (do) not respond to re-direction\u2026 de-escalation techniques are used and law enforcement and/or the case manager is contacted depending upon the seriousness of the incident.\u201d Review of other documentation described the client\u2019s behaviors and needs which were outlined on their Individual Needs and Services Plans, and facility staff completed Safety Plans with clients in care, to identify triggers to behaviors and ways for clients to regulate their feelings. Upon review of the Incident Reports, and information gathered through interviews, at the time of the altercations, staff had offered coping strategies to clients, separated the clients per facility policy and the Police Department was contacted to support in de-escalating the aggressing clients. Through interviews, multiple staff reported that the Police Department will be contacted by request support at the facility when clients are a danger to themselves or others. The department has conducted a complaint investigation regarding the allegation: Facility staff did not prevent youths in care from engaging in physical altercations. Based on LPA interviews conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED.

The department has conducted a complaint investigation regarding the allegation: Staff restrained minor in care. There was insufficient evidence to state that staff inappropriately restrained a minor in care. Upon review of incident reports, and based on information gathered during interviews, restraints are permitted to be conducted as a last resort when there is a safety concern of danger to a youth or others, and is to be conducted by two CPI trained staff, including pertaining FC1. Per review of the facility Program Statement, \u201cPhysical intervention should only be used as a last resort, when all other attempts to defuse the crisis situation using non-physical means have been tried and found ineffective. They will only be used when an individual presents a danger to self or others and when the risks posed when an individual presents a danger to self or others.\u201d Staff who utilized restraints were CPI trained, and Incident Reports reviewed documented there was one restraint conducted in the month of September 2022 (on 09/28/2022). Incident Reports and staff interviewed both stated that there was a need for the restraint due to the youth being a danger to self or others, and after other de-escalation techniques were attempted and unsuccessful. Based on LPA interviews conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to Bill Ryland, Homes for Teens Director.\n\nConfidential interviews were conducted with twelve individuals during the period of 09/16/2022 to 01/26/2023, and attempted with seven individuals during the period of 11/21/2022 to 01/26/2023. The department has conducted a complaint investigation regarding the allegations: Staff did not provide a safe environment for children, Facility has insufficient staffing to meet children's needs, Staff do not report incidents as required, and Staff are not adequately trained to meet the needs of children in care. Based on interviews conducted, a staff reported they were asked to go home without completing an Incident Report on 09/10/2022, and another staff reported that they do not recall filling out an incident report for the incident involving FC1 on 09/10/2022. Review of incident Reports for three youth in care included incidents involving youth absence without permission, youth aggression and threats, and property destruction. The Incident Report pertaining to FC1 on 09/10/2022, could not be provided from the facility, and there is no evidence that the Law Enforcement Incident Report had been completed or submitted to the department as required. There was sufficient evidence to support that the facility had insufficient staffing to meet the children\u2019s needs. Based on review of clients\u2019 Needs and Services Plans and Assessments, documentation of the need for clients to have one on one or additional staff was not documented. Upon review of the facility\u2019s Program Statement, it states \u201cDuring awake hours a minimum of two staff will be on duty at all time, 24 hours and day, 7 days a week. Depending on occupancy, the targeted awake ration is 1 staff to 2 youth.\u201d Based on review of staff schedules and time sheets, there were times when serious incidents occurred, but there was only one staff on shift, leaving youth in care with unmet safety needs. The physical environment of the facility was observed to be free of hazards during the Department\u2019s physical inspection of the facility, however through interviews and record reviews it was determined that staff present during multiple interventions were not sufficiently trained or capable in their skills to support the needs of the children in care, therefore not providing a safe environment. Upon review of Crisis Prevention Intervention (CPI) certificates, nine staff who worked at the facility did not complete training and obtain their certificates until 09/28/2022, however this was within the required 90 days after their hire date. continued on 9099-c\n\nBased on LPA observations, documentation reviewed, and interviews which were conducted, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. The facility is being issued three citations related to the complaint investigation and pertaining to deficiencies to the following regulations, Group Home ILS section 84065.5(c) If the children require special care and supervision because of age, problem behavior or other factors, the number of on-duty child care staff shall be increased; section 84061(i) The licensee shall submit reports to the Department, using form LIC 624-LE or a report containing all the information required in LIC 624-LE, regarding any incident that involves law enforcement contact with a child residing in the facility; and section 84065(i)(2) Sixteen hours of training shall be completed by new child care staff within 90 days of hire. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to Bill Ryland, Homes for Teens Director.\n\nThrough record review of time sheets, it was determined that these staff completed their shifts while on shift with at least one CPI trained staff person during the month of September. Upon review of the facility\u2019s Program Statement, \u201cIf assaultive behavior continues to be displayed and a clear risk is perceived, staff may employ a team physical intervention as a last resort. Generally, this will involve the use of the CPI Team Control technique, with two staff members involved ensuring that the service user\u2019s upper and lower body strength is restricted, along with their mobility.\u201d Based on review of Incident Reports, assaultive behaviors from FC1 and FC3 did occur at the facility during the month of September, and while there was a minimal or inconsistent amount of CPI trained staff present, presenting an unsafe environment for clients in care, as well as staff. Due to staff not being able to physically intervene when appropriate, utilizing CPI curriculum, staff contacted Law Enforcement as an alternative to de-escalate youth who were threatening, or acting aggressively, toward youth in care and staff present, as a way to de-escalate unsafe situations. There was consistent evidence to determine that staff are not adequately trained to meet the needs of children in care, including interviews conducted with two staff who stated they did not receive initial or thourough training, felt unprepared and unsupported and were not given additional time to complete required training while on shift. Based on a review of the facility\u2019s Program Statement, it stated,\u201d All direct care staff shall receive two full days training in CPI Nonviolent Crisis Intervention\u00ae within three months of commencing in their post..\u201d and \u201cAn additional 16-Hour training will be completed of the new direct care staff within 90 days of hire.\u201d Upon review of CPI certificates, nine staff who worked at the facility did not complete and obtain their certificates until 09/28/2022, however this was within the required 90 days after their hire date. Additionally, based on a review of training documents and certificates, it was determined that at the time of the incidents occuring in September 2022, the required 16 hour initial training for new staff was not yet due, with the due date being 90-days after their hire date. However, this training was either not completed or was not completed within the 90-day time-frame, as of February 07, 2023, for five out of ten staff whose training documentation was reviewed for a second time. continued on 9099-c",
