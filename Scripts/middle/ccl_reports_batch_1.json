In addition, LPA Turner was not able to qualify one client during the interview process, and was not able to obtain exact dates and times of incidents reported. During the investigation LPA Turner was informed that C1 was removed from the facility without prior notification. Staff was not aware of C1 being discharge. Staff advised LPA Turner that C1 lost personal belongings in bedding and no other clients or staff took belongings. It was also confirmed that appointments were missed due to mis-communication between the parties involved. It was confirmed by staff members that C1 was the one listening to inappropriate music in the facility. Staff denied that there was a lack of supervision in the facility while client was in care. Lastly, LPA Turner was notified by staff that C1 was provided snacks when RP randomly picked them up from the facility. Staff were unable to provide fully cooked meals before they left the facility. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Admin Nakooka showed the maintenance issue log with the boiler issue logged today, and informed me their facility maintenance staff was scheduled to arrive later today to address the issue. A technical violation is being issued for lacking hot water. 2 of 3 clients declined to give entry to their bedrooms, the third client's room was equipped with a clean comfortable mattress, blankets, and pillows as needed, was decorated to the client's tastes, and contained sufficient storage for client's personal belongings.

In witness interviews, staff deny they have made inappropriate comments to a client and/or inappropriately disciplined the client, that staff were physically aggressive with client and that a client sustained an injury; the CCH facility documentation indicates the same.

LPA Buchannan was informed that prior to the medication error, the client had been having a series of behaviors which resulted in a head injury. LPA was informed that staff was concerned about following concussion protocol and transported the client to the Urgent Care. This resulted in staff forgetting to check the Medication Administration Record (MAR) to determine if the client had any mid-day medications. Staff stated that the client usually does not take a mid-day medication and therefore they did not check the MAR and/or grab the medication. LPA confirmed through documentation that the client was taking this medication for a 7-day period and the date of the incident was the first day they had started taking it. Additionally, LPA did not observe the client to miss any other doses of prescribed medications for the month of December 2024.

Also, the facility staff contacted a nurse who advised them how to proceed with medical care and that staff followed this advice. Lastly, all clients reported to have their medical needs met. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "Based on evidence obtained and confidential interviews conducted during the investigation process the above allegations are substantiated. It was confirmed that on 07/25/2024 staff at the facility opened a minor\u2019s mail without consent. Although the client was present while opening the package, the facility was unable to provide any evidence that the client consented to staff opening the package. It was also confirmed that staff did not safeguard minor\u2019s personal items. On 7/26/24 a client had a watch gifted to them which was not working properly. The facility took the watch to get it fixed and once completed, it was handed to a staff member who kept the item with them for multiple days and did not notify the administrator. LPA confirmed that 3 out of 4 client Medication Administration Records (MARs) had medication errors that were not reported to Community Care Licensing (CCL) timely. Also, on 2/20/25 the facility failed to report an incident in which a client had become escalated and injured them self, which resulted in the client needing a medical evaluation by the facility nurse. The facility failed to submit a 24-hour incident or a subsequent 7-day incident report for all incidents above. Finally, it was confirmed by incident reports submitted to CCL that the facility staff did not ensure minor's medication was given as prescribed by their physician. The medication errors occurred on the following dates with 3 different clients: 12/10/24, 12/13/24, 12/16/24, 1/02/25,1/04/25, and 1/06/25. Based on LPAs interviews which were conducted and record review, The preponderance of evidence standard has been met; therefore, the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Exit interview conducted, copy of this report and the Appeal Rights were discussed and provided to the licensee.\n\nBased on evidence gathered and confidential interviews conducted during the investigation, the allegations above cannot be substantiated because they were inconsistent statements throughout the investigation process. It was confirmed that on February 20, 2025, an incident took place in which a client\u2019s door was closed while they became escalated. Facility staff observed, an injury on the client\u2019s hand and a mark on the forehead but believed the forehead mark to be from a previous injury on 12/12/24. The facility nurse completed an in-person evaluation of the client and made the decision that it wasn\u2019t an Urgent Care matter. LPA was also unable to determine that staff falsified minors\u2019 records during the same incident due to there being no staff who witnessed the client\u2019s behavior. In addition, LPA was unable to obtain any physical evidence that the client\u2019s authorized representatives were not contacted in a separate incident on 2/24/25. It was also not confirmed that the facility staff did not prevent minor from committing self-harm behavior. An incident took place on 3/12/25, in which a client had become escalated resulting in a self-inflicted head injury. It was proven that facility staff used verbal escalation techniques prior to the behavior and Ukeru pads once the client began to injure them self. In addition, the investigation was unable to prove or disprove that the facility was in disrepair or not kept clean. During LPAs visit on 3/5/25 the facility was observed to be clean and in full repair. LPA was also unable to obtain specific dates in which facility was alleged to be dirty or in disrepair and all clients stated that the facility is cleaned on a regular basis. LPA also could not confirm that the facility staff did or did not provide adequate laundry services. 9 out of 11 confidential interviews stated that the facility staff do provide adequate laundry services. During LPAs visit on 3/5/25 it was observed that client\u2019s laundry was clean and put away. In addition, LPA was unable to obtain a specific date or time in which staff did not provide laundry services to confirm or deny allegation. Also, LPA could not determine that transportation was not provided to minor in care. LPA was informed that there were initial issues with transportation on several occasions due to the client needing 2 staff and a driver, leaving the facility below ratio. However, LPA obtained documentation from the facility that showed the client did attend swimming classes on at least 14 occasions between 7/24/24 and 10/10/24. Continue to 9099-C\n\nLastly, LPA also could not prove that facility staff did or did not interfere with minors\u2019 calls. 9 out of 11 interviews stated that facility staff allow the client to make confidential calls. LPA was unable to determine whether facility staff were disrupting phone calls to prevent client from making them or attempting to verbally redirect them while escalated during a phone conversation. Although the allegations may have happened or may be valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED.

The first incident occurred on 05/13/2023 at a city park when C1 impersonated a police officer and tried to handcuff a child in the park. This happened due to lack of supervision by the two staff that were supposed to be supervising him. One staff was reportedly on his phone and the other was playing basketball. The second incident occurred on 05/15/2023 when the Gardena Police Department arrested C1 and charged him with assault, false imprisonment and impersonating an officer. After he was charged he was released to the facility. The third incident occurred on 06/15/2023 when C1 became violent, destroyed property and was placed on a psychiatric hold after being informed that he was being terminated from Young Adult Institute. The final incident occurred when C1 was picked up from the hospital by the Gardena Police Department and arrested for the incidents of 05/13/2023. C1 never returned to the facility. The judge ordered him returned home to Sacramento County. The facility was cited under 80061(b)(1)(E), 84061(i) and 84065.2(b)(1). The administrator was informed of the licensee's appeal rights. Administrator Adedapo Ajibade provided copies of the letters of disciplinary action that were issued to Staff #1 and Staff #2 for failure to properly supervise Client #1",

In response to two incident reports submitted, dated 6/7/2021 regarding physical restraints (staff to client), and the amount of time allocated for a client to remain in the restraint. FD stated that there is no \"written maximum time a client can be in a staff related restraint. The objective of this restraint is to keep the minor from harming self and others and to gradually transition the client to the least restrictive physical restraint i.e. a seated position free of physical touch by staff, when the client is deemed no longer a threat to themselves or others. During the time of the restraints, there is always a nurse present to assist and monitor the client to prevent physical injury and to verbally redirect the client to baseline. In the two Incidents on 6/7/2021, staff followed protocol correctly in both events and both clients were examined by the nurse after the restrain was completed and both were also provided with mental health assistance as well.

Documentary evidence revealed routine daily cleaning by facility housekeeping staff twice a day to manage and prevent mold growth. LPA obtained copies of daily housekeeping and cleaning logs. Documentary evidence, interviews, and statements obtained during the investigation process, did not corroborate the allegation, Staff does not ensure facility is kept free of pests. It was reported that there are ants in the common area of the units, however, confidential interviews and LPA observation did not reveal that there are ants in the common area or facility. Documentary evidence reflects monthly pest control services at the facility. LPA obtained copies of invoices for monthly pest control services at the facility. Based on the interviews conducted and documentary evidence, the information gathered did not produce corroborating evidence to support the allegations, Staff does not ensure facility is kept free of mold and Staff does not ensure facility is kept free of pests.

Between March 7th, 2020 to March 9th, 2020, documentation of resident information log revealed inconsistencies on exactly when C1 was placed on constant eyesight. On March 9th, 2020, it was confirmed that C2 gave C1 AA batteries not knowing the reason why C1 wanted them. Per interviews, there were no witnesses to C1 swallowing the batteries on this day and C1 informed S2 on what occurred. LPA could not interview S2 after multiple attempts; however, documentation revealed that appropriate steps were taken by staff and C1 was taken to the hospital by the ambulance as soon as it was reported. Documents revealed that facility took steps of interventions to assist with the needs of C1. Child & Family Team Meeting notes revealed it was discussed for C1 to have an alternative placement due to her dangerous behaviors. On 03/05/2020, a request for an emergency removal of C1 was made due to her extremely unsafe behaviors almost daily that put herself and others at risk. It was indicated in the request for removal that despite having a 1:1 supervision, C1 was able to engage in serious self injurious behaviors and the facility was not able to keep her safe. Furthermore, per interviews, it was indicated that S3 gave C1 the vape pen that she had on March 4th, 2020 but S3 denied the allegation and LPA could not confirm how C1 obtained the vape pen. In addition, representative from Los Angeles County Department of Probation shared no concerns on how the facility handled both situations. Based on the information obtained and confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be unsubstantiated. There were no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of the report will be emailed to the Unit Supervisor.",

LPA spoke with Unit Supervisor Renee Capeloto. The SIR #718550 indicated that on 09/02/2020 at approximately 10:00AM, it was brought to the attention of staff that C1 was suspected of smoking marijuana. When confronted by staff, C1 reported receiving marijuana from a Delta-T staff, Staff 1 (S1). It was reported that S3 checked video footage to see if C1's allegation of receiving marijuana from S1 could be verified. After checking video footage, S1 was seen talking to C1 on two occasions but did not appear to give him anything. She was seen on camera opening C1\u2019s room door. S3 spoke with S1 and informed her of the allegations. S1 vehemently denied bringing or giving any resident marijuana or anything illegal. S3 sent S1 home. It was reported that S3 contacted the Child Abuse Hot Line and reported the incident but was informed that due to C1 being 18-years-old that the incident did not warrant a new referral and that the information would be passed along as a note to CSW. On facility\u2019s Resident Information/daily Log and the internal Unusual Occurrence Report for C1, revealed that the incident/ allegation was documented; however, facility failed to submit this incident as an SIR until LPA informed facility that this is a serious reportable incident and an SIR is deemed necessary for an incident that may result in health and safety hazards to clients. Continue on 809-C\n\nLPA Yem interviewed pertinent parties. Although C1 and S1 denied the allegation to the LPA, the incident occurred on 09/02/2020 and facility did not report the unusual incident to the Department until 09/10/2020 after being contacted by LPA informing the facility of this concern. Based on the interview statements and documentation obtained, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met.

    "narrative": "Interviews revealed that C2 would bring illegal drugs to the facility and staff did do room searches and checked on C2 frequently for contraband. Additionally, interviews revealed that clients would bring in methamphetamine after coming back to the facility from a home pass, staff would conduct searches, and contrabands were not always found; in addition, no names of clients were confirmed besides C2. LPA could not determine how C2 obtained the substances due to inconsistent statements. Interviews indicated that C2 would get the substances when she would go on home pass. Department of Children and Family Services representative denied this claim because when the pandemic arose, visitations were limited. Documentation on Special Incident Reports revealed that around 02/18/2020 was the last known incident involving C2 having methamphetamine which was before visitations were limited. C3 confirmed C2 gave her substances; C3 was discharged from the facility since January 2020. C1 could not verify what timeframe the allegations occurred. LPA could not determine when or where C2 could have obtained the substances. Interviews revealed that staff was giving clients weed, vape pen, and wax pens but LPA could not verify if this it true due to no staff\u2019s names given during this time frame. It was reported that clients have access to prescribed medication. Confidential interviews revealed that C3 confirmed C2 gave her a prescribed medication that was prescribed to C1. Documentation revealed that C2 got the prescribed medication from C1. C1 confirmed that she \u201ccheeked\u201d the medication while nursing staff was giving her the medication. C1 indicated that she didn\u2019t think the clients were going to do something dangerous with it. C1 indicated that she was telling the heath center staff that she did not want to take the prescribed medication and the nursing staff crushed the medication so C1 couldn\u2019t cheek it. On 01/01/2020, documentation revealed that C3 was hospitalized due to taking 11 of the prescribed medication. Staff immediately checked on resident C3 and called 911. C3 was cleared medically and assessed by PMRT. Nursing staff from the facility\u2019s health center indicated that they have clients open their mouth wide, spread the mouth cheeks with their two index finger, left tongue up and down, flip top and bottom lips and speak before leaving medication window to make sure clients are not hiding medication in their mouths. LPA could not determine if there was a lack of supervision from staff due to staff taking appropriate steps with searching for contraband and nursing staff taking appropriate steps to try to prevent clients from hiding their medication in their mouths. Based on the information obtained during confidential interviews and inconsistent statements, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be unsubstantiated.

S1, S2 and S3 denied the allegation of the restraint resulting in injuries. Confidential interview revealed that S1 allegedly pinched C1\u2019s arm, while the restraint was conducted. Witness statements denied the allegation. Nursing assessment indicated there were no complaints of pain or injury at this time. LPA attempted to reach the observer (S4) which was present during the restraint for 01/13/2020 but S4 could not be reached after multiple attempts. On 03/20/2020 at approximately 9:55pm, it was reported that C1 was put into a restraint by staff members S5 and S6 and sustained bruises on her upper right hand, fingerprint bruises on her left arm and scratches on her left elbow. Documentation revealed that C1 spit on S1 and became physically assaultive towards S1. C1 denied being physical with S1. S6 denied the allegation of client sustaining an injury from the restraint and S5 could not be reached after multiple attempts. S7 was the observer of the restraint and denied seeing an inappropriate restraint or seeing marks or bruises on C1. Nursing Assessment dated 03/21/2020 indicated that C1 complained of having marks on her arm (fingerprints) not sure if was from last night or the day C1 was assessed; in addition, the assessment indicated that there were no complaints or pain and no further follow-up needed. Emergency Intervention Debriefing Form dated 03/23/2020 indicated that C1 reported injuries on 03/24/2020, including scrape on arm and bruising on shoulder and arm and nursing staff cleaned the area. The restraint incident occurred on 03/20/2020. No Photographs of C1 was obtained; however, the Debriefing took place on 03/23/2020. LPA could not determine if the marks and bruises were a result of the restraint or how C1 obtained the marks. LPA could not verify if C1 obtained any injury caused by a restraint due to inconsistent statements and no witnesses to this allegation. Furthermore, it was reported that a seclusion room has just a drain with no restroom and clients cannot come out to use the restroom. When asked if C1 was ever denied the restroom, C1 denied it. Clients that were interviewed also denied the allegation of staff denying them the use of a restroom. It was reported that clients can be in the seclusion room for up to 8 hours. Interviews revealed no confirmation on whether clients were placed in the seclusion room for up to 8 hours. LPA could not confirm if C1 obtained possible marks and bruises due to the restraints conducted or during the process of C1 struggling trying to get out of the restraints.

    "narrative": "It was revealed that on 06/13/2021, C1 stroked and orally copulated the penis of Client #2 (C2) in a room at the facility. Interviews and review of video footage confirm C1 and C2 along with two other clients were unsupervised by staff at the time the incident occurred, as the sole staff member who was in the room, momentarily left the room. The investigation further revealed that it was the suggestion of one of the other clients in the room that C1 orally copulate C2 to which C1 ultimately agreed after persistent request from that client. Although the act was not the request of C2, C2 did not refuse the act and pulled C2\u2019s pants down to assist C1. It was revealed C1 felt pressured to perform the act on C2 and as a result, C1 later informed a staff member what happened. Local law enforcement was contacted by the facility. C1 acknowledged C1 willfully performed the act on C2 but indicated C2 held C1\u2019s wrist while C1 performed the act. Per the video surveillance footage, the staff member on duty at the time left the room. C1 orally copulated C2 for approximately 3 seconds before the staff member returned to the room. Video footage indicates the staff member had left the room for approximately 30 seconds. Based on all information obtained during the investigation, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The Department has determined a lack of supervision contributed to sexual misconduct between C1 and C2 while in care. The allegation is deemed substantiated at this time and thus poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. The facility is issued a citation in accordance with the California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 5; Section 84172 (b) Personal Rights and Chapter 6; Section 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were discussed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List and appeal rights were provided to Facility Representative.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments and youth case plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. Licensing Program Manager Angela King observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Maricela Morales, Quality Assurance & EHRS Manager.",

Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPM Kim observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

Y1 reported that Y1 hit the right side of Y1\u2019s face on the wall. Upon assessment by the nurse at 8:45 PM, Y1 was observed with no injuries to the head or face areas. Later that evening at 9:30 PM, Y1 was seen by facility nursing staff, for superficial cuts on the face. At some point during medication distribution, Y1 requested a surgical mask from the nurse and proceeded to take out the nose strip of the mask to cut self on the face area. Superficial cuts were observed on Y1\u2019s right cheek, left cheek and forehead areas. Nurse treated Y1\u2019s injuries with no further incident. Based on confidential interviews and documentary evidence, the investigation found a lack of proof to substantiate that staff pushed Y1 causing injury while in care at Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services-Special Care. The allegation is determined Unsubstantiated as evidence obtained was not sufficient to substantiate the allegation.

    "narrative": "The Following Allegation was reported: 1. The staff are using an inappropriate form of punishment with minors in care. The Staff (S1, S2, and S3) denied the allegations, stating that all team members are trained in trauma-informed care and understand the importance of creating a safe and healthy environment within the group home. They explained that during behavioral incidents, staff utilize verbal redirection and provide positive reinforcement on a daily and weekly basis, implementing a point system where clients can earn points every forty-five minutes for demonstrating appropriate behavior. The Staff asserted that they have neither seen nor heard of any staff member denying clients water or using it as a form of punishment. Instead, they highlighted that staff actively encourage hydration, awarding clients points for each glass of water consumed, which can be exchanged daily or at the end of the week for various special privileges, including outings to their favorite restaurants. Furthermore, the account given by C2 corroborated the above information, indicating that they are receiving adequate support from the staff and feel safe residing in the facility. The statement obtained from CSW affirmed that they have no concerns regarding the care and supervision provided to their client, and their client has not reported any incidents of misconduct by the facility staff. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore, the allegation(s) are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the STRTP Administrator. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the Group Home Administrator Assistant.",

LPA Raissi advised for the facility to remove the Lysol spray (in entry area). Per the administrator, this is only for staff to disinfect before coming into the facility. LPA reminded that all cleaning supplies should be locked, administrator immediately removed the Lysol disinfectant spray and reassured this LPA that they will not leave the Lysol disinfectant spray out. LPA Tran interviewed Staff (S2) on 12/23/2020 as a follow up. S2 had verified the hazardous Lysol item was placed on the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) check-in station for staff to use. But since the complaint was created, the Lysol is always placed in a locked cabinet near the PPE station. Staff can access when needed. Based on LPAs Raissi and Tran\u2019s observations and interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation, \u201cHazardous items are accessible to clients\u201d is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. A deficiency was cited (Type A) for the allegation above this report on the attached 9099-D. Administrator immediately removed and locked the hazardous/toxic item, Lysol disinfectant spray.

    "narrative": "Of the three clients interviewed, one reported snack was not provided consistently, one reported snacks were provided too often, and the third reported that snacks were accessible, but another client would eat all the snacks. While the kitchen fridge was temporarily broken, clients needed staff assistance to access the spare fridge in the locked garage. During the facility inspection, LPA observed sufficient food and large boxes of snacks accessible to the clients. Regarding the allegation of: Staff did not ensure that facility refrigerator is repaired,18 confidential interviews reported that the refrigerator in the kitchen broke, but the facility had an extra refrigerator in the garage where all the perishable food was stored. The new refrigerator was ordered, and it was shipped in 3 days. All 18 interviews reported that although the clients didn\u2019t have access to a refrigerator in the facility, they had access to the refrigerator in the garage. LPA observed the newly replaced kitchen fridge, as well as the back-up fridge in the garage. Regarding the allegation of: Facility does not follow the required ratio for minors in care, consistent statements were made during interviews that when the facility is out of ratio, a staff is asked to stay late or come in early. Staff leads are the floaters and are to assist with supervision when short staffed to maintain ratio. Leads will report to the Administrator and the Administrator will make calls to staff from other facilities and upper management to ensure ratio is maintained. LPA reviewed the staff schedule and observed ratio to have been maintained. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews, and record reviews, although the allegations may have happened, or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violations did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report and LIC-9099C were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted. Appeal rights were provided.",

As for staff not following a minor\u2019s care plan, records indicate that there was insufficient compliance to the plans nor was there enough follow-up done by healthcare professionals that the facility has on staff.

Two staff state that C1 can't be restrained due to Individual Program Plan (IPP).

Although minor did present with an injury, (5 inches by 4 inches bruise on right thigh with diamond and triangle marks) Licensing Program Analyst unable to determine where injury occurred and who was responsible. Clients in facility are all non-verbal and unable to be interviewed. Facility staff interviewed all corroborate that they did not observe any behavior by clients and/or staff that would have caused the injury. School did report restraint of client on 06/16/2022 but, was transparent with photos and did not observe the injury in question. Interview with school staff corroborate that injury did not occur during restraint and school staff identified the injury the following day. Based on the investigation, records reviewed and interviews conducted, the complaint finding is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Allegation: Client not being provided with PRN medication as needed. The allegation is staff mismanaged minor\u2019s medication. Review of daily medication chart indicates client received PRN medication on 05/19/2022. 05/21/2022, 05/25/2022 and 05/28/2022 for watery eyes and runny nose visible symptoms.

LPA unable to identify if PRN\u2019s were provided as soon as symptoms began which may have prevented chapping to nose and face. Interviews with staff corroborate PRN\u2019s are given based on visible symptoms as client does not have a way to communicate need for allergy medication. Based on the investigation, records reviewed and interviews conducted, the complaint finding is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

Regarding the allegation that staff did not ensure supervision of youth in care, statements made during interviews by 5 of 7 staff corroborated that emergency ratios are utilized at minimum 1-2 times a week. Emergency ratios were defined as 2:1 ratio clients going to 1:1 and 1:1 ratio client going to general supervision. One staff stated facility is never out of ratio but, did refer to emergency ratio. One staff stated the facility is never out of ratio. The Regional Center determines the level of supervision needed based upon the needs of the clients. These fluctuating ratios were not approved by the Regional Center or Community Care Licensing. All clients are unable to be interviewed because they are non-verbal. Based on LPA\u2019s observations and interviews which were conducted, and record reviews of time sheets, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Title 22 Division 6 Chapter 5 84078 (b) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision is being cited. Allegation #2 Needs and Services plans not being adhered to for minor in care. Regarding the allegation that Needs and Services plans are not being adhered to for minor in care, statements made during interviews were corroborated. Two of three staff present corroborated that the definition of imminent danger was reached during a client behavior when client hit his eyes with closed fists and slammed his head into the wall but, a restraint was not conducted as outlined in the Individual Emergency Intervention Plan resulting in injuries to clients face- bruising and swelling to eyes and bridge of nose. One of the staff stated the restraint was not done because a staff was uncomfortable with doing a restraint. One staff does not recall how client received injuries. Based on interviews and record review of incident report and photographs submitted, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that youth in care was touched inappropriately, statements made during interviews by 6 of 6 staff corroborated that C1 is capable of toileting independently but, does require prompting. 4 staff of 6 staff stated they were unaware of a client being touched inappropriately. Two staff stated that C1 was struggling with diarrhea on 09/16/2022 when S6 assisted C1 in the bathroom. S6 stated \u201cI put on gloves and gently guided his penis into the toilet to avoid a mess.\u201d S1 confirmed that S6 communicated this was done \u201cas urine was shooting out.\u201d Although S6 did touch youth, it was done to assist youth and therefore, not with negative intent. Record review of Individual Program Plan, indicates C1 is toilet trained, however does have occasional inappropriate urinations. Based on lack of observation and information provided by interviewees, the LPA found that while this allegation may have occurred or is valid, there was not a preponderance of evidence to prove that it did or did not occur, therefore LPA has found it to be unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, a copy of this report and appeal process was reviewed and provided to the Administrator.",

Another one of the citations is related to allowance and the facility is providing Personal Incidentals (P & I)I to clients. This was a misunderstanding by LPA of the regulation. As such, two of the LIC809Ds issued on 05/03/2023 were amended to remove these citations. LPA Goldie provided the facility with the updated documents to remove the discussed citations.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Connie Goldie, and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Jodean Hall, conducted an informal office meeting located at 9835 Goethe Road, Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95827 to discuss safety concerns for C1 and staff because of severe level of self-injurious behaviors and aggression towards staff. Present from Merakey Tenaya was: Jronesha Brown - Administrator, Alisa Dean- Director and Clinical Director Alex Compton. Present virtually from Valley Mountain Regional Center was: Cindy Jiminez- Program Manager, Val Harris- QBMP Chris Pillsbury, Facility Laison, Austin McCormick ,Service coordinator and Greg Lee Behavior Specialist 2. Subsequent to receiving Incident Report dated 12/30/2023 and photographs of injuries C1 incurred due to self-injurious behaviors, CCL requested the following additional information. LPA received facility staff roster with contact information, Quarterly Reports, Behavior Consultant data, Staff Data Reports, Data Tracking Sheets, Medical discharge documentation, Refusal of Emergency Medical Services forms dated 12/30/2024 and 01/04/2024, Restraint Logs, Emergency Intervention Plan updated 10/10/2023, IBSP updated 01/18/2024 with a Head Injury Plan and C1\u2019s current Individual Program Plan. The Department acknowledges that facility has recognized the need to implement new plans and has made efforts to keep C1 safe by updating C1\u2019s Individual Emergency Intervention Plan (IEIP), updating his Individual Behavior Service Plan (IBSP) on 01/18/2024 to include a Head Injury Plan and provided staff with additional trainings \u2013 Crisis drills and In-services by Kim Simpkins, Regional Director of Program Supports. Additionally, the Department recognizes that more restraints will be implemented based on change to C1\u2019s IEIP. Based on the records reviewed, LPA learned that during incidents when C1 is demonstrating SIB and imminent danger is determined, and a restraint is deemed necessary, staff are unable to effectively hold C1. Staff are having to release and reset holds frequently for safety. Additionally, staff are being bitten, kicked, and scratched. Continued on LIC809C\n\nDuring confidential interviews with staff, it has been stated that some staff are not as confident with conducting restraints and as a result holds are unsuccessful. The Department is recommending that the supervision ratio for C1 be increased from 2:1 to 3:1 for 90 days to provide staff support and confidence to perform effective holds when they are deemed necessary. No deficiencies will be cited . Exit interview conducted with facility staff at 11:10 AM. A copy of the report along with appeal rights were discussed and provided.",

Youth were relocated to a hotel and treatment was completed. A previous complaint received on 05/13/2024 was investigated by the Department pertaining to the initial mold and it was determined the facility responded correctly. On 04/23/2024, the facility did test positive for mold present and was treated. On 05/06/2024, the facility was retested for mold and received a clearance report along with a Certificate of Treatment stating, \u201cyour home will be mold-free for 12 months from May 1, 2024\u201d. Based on an email received from a staff member on 03/10/2025, stating two youth in home suffered seizures due to mold present in the home and additional assessments were completed. Two of four clients did experience a one-time seizure (C1- 11/14/2024 and C2- 02/14/2025). LPA interviewed C1\u2019s medical assistant who stated C1 was diagnosed with a non-specified seizure and no mention of mold was identified in medical record. C2\u2019s discharge paperwork indicates he was kept overnight for observation on 02/14/2025 due to seizure activity observed at the facility and was discharged with medication but, mold was not listed as a possible contributor. The Administrator stated that a Heating, Ventilation and Air conditioning technician, a contractor and a mold mediation company completed assessments of the home on 03/11/2025 and 03/13/2025 and no evidence of mold was observed. Record review of documentation provided by facility from Air Environmental and Pacific Pure Air corroborates this. Although two youth did experience a medical incident, there isn\u2019t evidence to support that mold was the cause. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the allegation occurred or not.

Based on his dangerous behaviors and staffs\u2019 inability to manage them safely, which potentially causes a health and safety concern to any other children residing in the facility, LPA Belfield recommends the facility begin working closely with the placement agency to locate an appropriate Adult Residential Facility for C1 to move to upon his 18th birthday. Based on his behaviors, this may be difficult to find, which is why the search for an adult placement is being recommended this far in advance. Unless there is a significant change to his behaviors, C1 would likely not be compatible to remain in care with children or remain in a Group Home beyond his 18th birthday.\u201d Licensee Faraj stated to LPA Belfield that conversations regarding C1's future placement have already begun.

The incident report stated, in summary, that C1 unexpectedly exited the facility van during a drive in the community. This happened despite staff trying to prevent C1 from exiting the facility van. While outside the van, C1 ran into the street. To prevent C1 from getting hit from an oncoming car, staff used a non-FEIP/IEIP approved restraint to pull C1 out of the street and preventing him getting seriously injured. The facility created a plan of corrective action to avoid this type of incident in the future. The plan includes: The facility will refraining from outings unless a third person (admin) is available to assist. Submitted a licensing exception for use of a seatbelt buckle guard. Staff have been notified that the staff sitting in the middle row and providing the duty of primary staff should be a male staff (due to Dominic\u2019s preference, not ability level of staff). Staff will repeat additional emergency intervention training refresher. LPA also discussed with the facility about the frequency of IRs related to restraints/incidents related to C1. LPA also informed facility that they needed to identify staff members in IRs. LPA requested C1's NSP (Needs and Service Plan.) Exit interview was conducted with George Grant, ADM.",

CCL received a phone call expressing concern with the frequency of the above listed facility's phone calls to law enforcement. LPA Simien went over the facility's policy regarding law enforcement contact. ADM stated that there was an increased in calls mostly due to clients calling emergency services. ADM stated that sometimes clients call 911 on personal phones without staff knowledge or request the facility phone and then call 911. When staff witness a client call 911 they will inquire what the issues is. If appropriate, staff will try to redirect the client by either trying to solve the issue or provide an alternative resource (I.E. mental health hotline). If the client insists on calling 911 then that's within the clients' personal rights. ADM mentioned that sometimes when a client wants to go to the hospital they will reject using facility transport and insist on using emergency services. ADM stated that when staff calls emergency services, it's mostly due to clients needing medical attention. ADM stated that they use Ukeru pads to help prevent self-harming and will use restraints as a last resort if a client is in imminent danger but sometimes clients will still need medical attention after engaging in self harm. ADM mentioned that himself and staff have been confronted by local law enforcement officers about the increased calls. ADM stated that he has attempted to explain the regulations that facility works within to local law enforcement officers when confronted but has mostly been disregarded. LPA Simien reviewed the facility's incident reports involving law enforcement from August 2024 and September 2024 and found no violations of regulations. Exit interview was conducted and and a copy of this report was provided to George Grant, ADM whose signature confirms the receipt of this document.",

IR #1 stated C1 eloped from facility due to lack of supervision. LPA interviewed 4 staff and the PA who all corroborated that C1 is a 1:1 client and there was a lapse of supervision when S4, (C1\u2019s assigned staff at the time) used the restroom and did not ensure another staff was supervising C1. As a result, C1 eloped and left through an open garage door. C1 was not discovered to be missing by staff but, by individual at community store. C1 must be within the line of sight of a staff to be kept safe, as he has a history of elopement IR# 2 stated a medication error occurred. PA and staff involved confirmed a medication error occurred due to S1 misreading Medication Administration Record (MAR) and S3 not catching error when verifying medication preparation. Additionally, medication change form was removed from staff sign in area so S1 did not observe it. Lastly, the MAR did not have a black mark to decease previous dosage because date of change was on the last day of March. Based on LPA\u2019s interviews and the incident reports, two Title 22 deficiencies are being cited. 80075 (b)(5) (B) and 84078 (b) One civil penalty is being assessed for repeat violation within 30 days.

Staff took appropriate action by calling poison control and did take C1 to the hospital to ensure he was safe. Based on the fact that staff are now aware of this potential a technical advisory is being issued. This is not a deficiency.

C1 is non-verbal and non-ambulatory. C1 engages in self-harm behaviors. Both the school and home stated that C1 has SIB (Self Injury Behavior) The reporting party stated that C1 likes to hit his head with his leg but that this injury is different and was concerned about C1 receiving 1:1 care at home. The reporting party stated that the injury was noticed at approximately 10:00 AM on 7/24/2024 at C1\u2019s school. Facility staff and school staff interviewed all corroborate that C1 demonstrates self injurious behavior. The increase in C1\u2019s SIB (Self-injury-behavior) behavior could be the result of a medication change according to the Administrator. During confidential interviews with staff at the home C1 is receiving 1:1 care during the day and 1:2 care at night. This is also noted in C1\u2019s Needs and Service Plan. At school C1 is receiving 1:1 care. LPA Shelton observed C1 at school on 7/31/24 and notice a red mark on C1\u2019s noise and the injury to C1\u2019s was no longer purple or brown in color.

The condition of this was that staff are to still sit in the hallway to be close to C1 and if for any reason the assigned staff needed to leave their position at any time, they are to notify the lead on shift, and provide the key to C1\u2019s door and then the lead is to take over that staff\u2019s 1:1 until they return.

The facility is required to use a specific company to address damage that is significant like broken windows and doors. Although communication could have been better, it is unknown as to whether that would have prompted the State appointed contractor to address the repairs sooner. Regarding the issue related to the client receiving medication in a timely manner, documentation indicates the client was complaining of cold like symptoms on 3/13/23 but was ambivalent about going to a doctor for treatment at that time. Documentation is not clear as to when the client was seen by a doctor, but there were a couple of attempts to get treatment from a provider and to offer to get treatment for the client. The client refused a couple of times and one urgent clinic refused to see the client. The client did receive over the counter medications to treat the cold symptoms starting on 3/13/23 and ending on 3/16/23 with a medical providers prescription in place. It is possible that other options may have resulted if the client received medical treatment sooner, like seeking a telehealth appointment. The allegations are determined to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to provide the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED.",

C1 was admitted to the hospital in November 2023, hospital staff called the facility when C1 was due to be discharged but were unable to pick C1 up due to no staff being available. It was reported that the facility was leaving C1 at the hospital because they might not have staff to care for C1 during the weekends. LPA Stiger was not able to confirm if staff was not available to pick up C1, but interview statements obtained indicated that the facility has had Administrator changes but was fully staffed and current staff will pick up shifts as needed. Lastly, LPA Stiger was not able to obtain supportive information from C1 or C2 because they were distracted with their electronics and not engaging with LPA during the interview process.

It was reported that on 2/22/24, C1 met with the hospital psychiatrist, and the 5150 hold was discontinued, as it was determined that C1 did not need to go to a psychiatric hospital. It was reported that on 2/22/24, S2 was informed that C1 was ready for discharge, and S2 refused to pick up C1 from the hospital. Confidential interviews indicated the facility was not comfortable to pick C1 up from the hospital due to C1\u2019s dangerous behavior. Confidential interviews indicated that facility staff were waiting for a referral for C1 to be transferred to the hospital or for C1 to be reassessed. However, C1 was unable to be transported to the hospital due to the termination of C1\u2019s 5150 hold. Record review indicates C1\u2019s 5150 hold was discontinued by medical personnel on 2/22/24. Although confidential interviews revealed that facility staff were present with C1 at the hospital, confidential interviews and record review indicate that C1 was not picked up from the hospital by facility staff and returned to the facility until 2/24/24.

It was specifically reported that staff have not taken C1 for medical care in the past and as of today (01/16/2025). During the investigation, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that the staff ensures clients are taken to medical appointments and when the clients do not attend medical appointments, CSWs are notified, and missed appointments are documented and rescheduled. In addition, a confidential interview disclosed that on 10/09/2024 C1 missed an appointment and it was rescheduled for 10/15/2024 and C1 attended their (C1) appointment. Community Care Licensing also received an allegation that staff did not provide records to minor's health care provider. It was specially reported that there have been several occasions when the facility\u2019s staff did not bring C1\u2019s medical documentation binder to an appointment with the caregiver. During the investigation, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that staff do not withhold clients\u2019 medical documentation from caregivers. In addition, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that staff do a great job communicating with CSWs regarding client\u2019s medical needs.

    "narrative": "On 01/16/2025, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received an allegation that staff touched a client in an inappropriate manner. It was specifically reported that there were concerns about sexual abuse and that S1 showered C1. During the investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that on one occasion, there wasn\u2019t the same gender staff available, S1 assisted C1 with showering only using verbal prompts with the bathroom door cracked open outside the bathroom. A confidential interview stated that S1 was not in the bathroom while C1 was showering and did not touch C1 at all. In addition, a confidential interview disclosed that S1 have not seen C1 naked and C1 can shower without assistance from staff and get dressed by themselves. A confidential interview disclosed that the facility staff always reports when they are short-staffed and has even adjusted the schedule so that there is always the same gender staff working with C1. Another confidential interview disclosed staff are present when C1 showers but C1 needs minimal prompting and if only the opposite gender staff are available, they will wait outside the door and assist with having C1's required equipment and clothes ready. Multiple confidential interviews disclosed that there are no concerns for staff at the facility. LPA was unable to gather additional information. In regard to the allegation that staff showed the client inappropriate violent video content, it was specifically reported that S1 has shown C2 violent and aggressive videos called \"Two-year-old gets beaten down to death by babysitter and boyfriend.\" During the investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that while staff were at the hospital with C2, staff let C2 watch a documentary on the facility\u2019s work phone and that two staff took turns holding the phone. In addition, a confidential interview disclosed that S1 held the phone for C2 after C2 had already watched the first half of the documentary. Furthermore, a confidential interview disclosed that the documentary was called \u201c\u2019 Monster\u2019 Babysitter and Boyfriend Savagely Beat 2-Year-Old Girl to Death\u201d and was educational but uneasy. In addition, a confidential interview disclosed that C2 watches a lot of movies such as scary movies, cop shows, and people being arrested and C2 also tries to watch cartel videos, animals being dissected, and other inappropriate videos. LPA was unable to receive additional information.\n\nRegarding the allegation that staff applied improper forms of restraint on a client, it was specifically reported that S1 had put C2 in improper restraints. During the investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that C1 has had to be put in a restraint, but exact date and reason could not be recalled. Multiple confidential interviews disclosed that some restraints have been unsuccessful but there haven\u2019t been any improper restraints reported. Lastly, a confidential interview disclosed that the facility typically does hold restraints that are not appropriate, and restraints are not used very often. In addition, the confidential interview disclosed that the facility has done a lot of work to come up with solutions on how to work with C1 and adjust to C1\u2019s needs for example, getting padded shields to de-escalate C1 from running away and avoid having the restrain. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that staff touched client in an inappropriate C1, staff showed C2 inappropriate violent video content, and staff applied improper forms of restraint on C2 may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

Administrator stated that the Facility Manager was on premises till 10 AM and the other supervisor also has been present. LPA was shown the video of the person sitting at the desk. LPA inquired why the contradicting information was provided to the LPA and LPA was informed that the Facility Manager was not on premises.\n\nLPA requested LIC 500 from the Administrator. LIC 500 was provided to the LPA. LPA did not observe the Facility Manager position on the LIC 500. LPA informed the Administrator that the position is required by the Title 22 and needs to be revised. Title 22 Chapter 5 Article 6 84065 (d) states The licensee shall designate at least one facility manager to be present at the facility at all times when children are present. LPA did not observe Facility Manager or the Administrator present at the facility at the time LPA arrived and there were 3 children at the facility at the time of LPA's visit. The Administrator did not arrive to the facility until 12:40. The facility is being cited for the violation of the section 84065 (d) Administrator.

    "narrative": "On Wednesday 6/16/21 at 9:33AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit to the facility to conduct a required annual inspection. A screening email and phone call were sent/attempted prior to the visit. Safety precautions were taken, including face masks, hand sanitizer, disinfectants, and social distancing. Additionally, LPA is vaccinated, tested negative for COVID-19 on Monday 6/14/21, and does not have any symptoms of COVID-19. LPA met with Dr. Linda LaBrie, Clinical Supervisor, and informed of the purpose of the visit. At 9:45AM, LPA conducted a tour of the facility and grounds. The facility is clean and free of debris. The grounds are free of obstructions and are well-maintained. The kitchen is stocked with food to meet the needs of the residents in care and meets the mandated 7-day non-perishable and 2-day perishable standard. Food items are in date and are labeled by date of purchase. Cleaners and sharps are kept in locked storage areas downstairs, and the laundry room (upstairs) is locked. There is a sign-in and screening table set up by the front entrance that includes a sign-in sheet, a thermometer, and hand sanitizer. At 10:05AM, LPA observed some kitchen cleaner in a high cabinet in the kitchen. Staff immediately moved these to the locked cleaning cabinet. At 10:22AM, LPA observed that the water temperature in the upstairs resident bathroom measured 125.6 F. LPA advises that, per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80088, hot water at vanity sinks should measure between 105 and 120 F, and measurements above 125 F require a hot water warning sign. Staff agreed to post a sign here until the hot water temperature can be lowered. At 10:35AM, LPA observed that there are cameras located in the following locations: facility entrance, front office, front living/dining area, back living room, classroom, and upstairs lounge. On 5/29/20, the facility was informed that a camera waiver is required before cameras can be used or fixed onto walls. LPA advises that the facility immediately deactivate the cameras and submit a waiver request for approval to use cameras.\n\nAt 10:50AM, LPA reviewed the facility files that were accessible to present staff. Emergency documentation was stored for each resident in an emergency information binder in the staff office. Staff and resident records, such as admission agreement, consent forms, etc. are only accessible to director, who agreed to send LPA the requested documents. LPA requested the following: most current LIC 500 Personnel Summary, LIC 610 Emergency Plan, all staff qualifications (LIC 501), all staff training record for 2020-current, each resident's face sheet, needs and services, admission agreement, and treatment/medical consent forms. There are no citations and two advisories. A follow-up to review the facility files will be conducted. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left with Dr. Linda LaBrie, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

During investigation, it was discovered that multiple incidents occurred at the facility, including incidents in which the police were called. Local police confirmed that police responded to incidents on 06/08/21 for a 5150 evaluation, 06/13/21 for an unauthorized absence, 06/16/21 for a suicide threat and 5150, 06/23/21 for a traffic complaint by a neighbor for which police contacted the facility, and 06/29/21 for suicide threat and 5150. None of these incidents or police contacts were reported to the Licensing agency. Only one report was submitted for an incident on 07/25/21. Additionally, the report for an incident in which two residents engaged in sexual activity at the facility was not properly reported to the Licensing agency. Review of resident R1\u2019s (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) Medication Administration Record (MAR) indicated that medication administration is not properly documented. The MAR used is an excel sheet rather than the LIC 622A and LIC 622B, or variation that includes all required information. The MAR was missing the dosage information for the medications and the chart of staff names administering medications. Only staff initials were included. There is disparity in administration time of medications that may be PRN and administered as advocated for by the youth. For instance, the same night medication was administered as early as 8:06PM and as late 11:51PM, and the morning medication was administered as early as 8:14AM and as late as 10:52PM. The latter may be a typo in the AM versus PM. However, the log does not document which medications are PRN or if medications not administered were missed or not administered for another reason. Lastly, the log includes all medications, including Sertraline (brand name is Zoloft), a psychotropic medication. Psychotropic medications must be logged separately on the LIC 622B or variation that includes all the same required information.\n\nOn 10/11/21, LPA learned in staff interviews that the facility was temporarily closed. LPA confirmed this with the administrator. No formal notice of closure was sent to the Licensing agency. LPA is issuing two citations and one advisory, per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80061(b) Reporting Requirements, 84070(b)(13) Children\u2019s Records, and 80061(e) Reporting Requirements.

Based on interviews, staff and residents confirmed that the facility is very understaffed, and lead staff were at times unable to tell which staff were on the next shift. Additionally, due to lack of staff, staff were forced to work overtime and were unsure if they were properly compensated. It was reported that lack of staffing resulted in clinical staff stepping in for supervision, potentially limiting time for individual therapy sessions, although this was not confirmed. Staff indicated that all staff were well-trained, but there was inconsistency in staffing at times.",

Staff returned to the milieu between 3 and 5 minutes later, but the exact time could not be confirmed. However, it was long enough for R1 and R2 to engage in sex in R1\u2019s room. Due to the known risk, there should have been enhanced supervision. The youth were separated and checked in with separately. Later, clinical staff responded and came to the facility that night. R1 was informed that this event was grounds for discharge. In response, R1 packed a bag and left the facility that night on an unauthorized absence. Based on staff interviews, R1 was not properly informed of this, triggering the leave. The police located the youth and were informed by clinical staff, as confirmed by clinical staff, that the youth could not return to the facility. R1 waited with police and then waited on the porch the next day until R1\u2019s parent could pick up R1. Staff kept an eye on the youth on the porch and provided food. However, the youth should have been encouraged to remain in the facility with enhanced supervision to keep youth separate from each other and the discharge procedures followed properly. R1 was prescribed the psychotropic medication Zoloft, AM dose, and an informed consent was signed by the parent, consenting to the administration of the medication while R1 was in the facility\u2019s care. However, it was confirmed that the medication was not administered because R1 was assessed by the facility's hired nurse practitioner, who continued the Zoloft and added additional medications, for which a new medication consent form needed to be signed by the parent(s). However, there should be no lapse in administration of medications, especially psychotropic medications. Documents and witness and staff interviews indicate that R1 was admitted on 7/14/21 and left the facility on 7/15/21. Per Administrator and CFO, R1 was assessed on 7/15/21 afternoon. The AM Zoloft dose should have been administered on 7/15/21 morning. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. LPA is issuing three citations, per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 84065.5 Staff/Child Ratios, 84068.4 Removal and/or Discharge Procedures, and 85075 Health Related Services.

Staff confirmed the day of the incident that clinical staff observed R1 and R2 \u201ccliquing\u201d as soon as R1 was admitted to the program.

The investigation continued consisting of, confidential interviews and contacts with, five former residents, five staff members, Facility Administrator, Facility Director, and other associated parties. The investigation further included review of related client and staff files, facility file history, facility records, and review of related Los Angeles Police (LAPD) report and LAPD associated records. On October 28, 2020, LAPD responded to Adolescent Growth, Inc. concerning an alleged sexual assault between Y1 and Youth #2 (Y2) reportedly occurring on October 27, 2020, for which Y2 was subsequently arrested. Records reviewed found that the facility failed to report the incident occurring between Y1 and Y2 to CCL and further failed to report the incident concerning Y2\u2019s related arrest. The investigation revealed a pattern of inappropriate behavior of youths in the facility occurring prior to the incident on October 27, 2020, yet measures were not taken to stop that behavior. Information obtained revealed staff failed to conduct room checks every 15 minutes in the evening and staff was usually working solely in the evenings. Staff on duty during the incident involving Y1 and Y2, had reported needing more support, including more staff and/or training resources, in order to effectively perform their job duties. Request for more help during the night shifts was not supported as Administration did not provide staff\u2019s request. A review of records found multiple incidents including, but not limited to, youth\u2019s absence without permission occurring in October 2020, in which local law enforcement was called and responded to the facility, that were never reported to Community Care Licensing. Statements obtained indicate incidents were submitted to facility administration; however, Investigator\u2019s request for these incident reports were not produced. (Continued on page LIC9099-C)\n\nBased on information from record review and confidential interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The Department has determined substantiated findings for neglect/lack of supervision contributing to inappropriate sexual activity between Y2 and Y1; Failure to Report incidents and failure to allow CCL staff entrance into the facility during initial complaint notification. The above-mentioned concerns pose an immediate and potential health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to youth placed in care. The following citations are issued in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5; 84065.2 Personnel Duties; 80061 Reporting Requirements and 80044 Inspection Authority.

On December 8, 2021, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging neglect/lack of supervision as Youth #1 (Y1) was reportedly sexually assaulted by another youth resident while in care (see LIC811, dated October 11, 2022). The allegation was investigated by Licensing Special Investigator Edward Hector of CCL Investigations Bureau. On December 14, 2021, Investigator Hector attempted to conduct an unannounced visit at the facility (Adolescent Growth, Inc.) to initiate the investigation into reported claims; however, after Investigator Hector arrived at the facility, identified himself with a State business card, an official State badge and photo identification positively confirming Investigator\u2019s employment with the State of California, Investigator Hector was refused access into the facility by facility staff member and further denied entry by facility supervisor to no avail. When Investigator Hector asked the facility supervisor for their name, they replied that their name was \u201cProgram Manager\u201d and refused to further identify themselves.

Staff stated they would never provoke minors to act inappropriately towards each other. Staff stated retalition against minors is not allowed. Staff stated minors are not denied the use of restrooms. Staff denied failing to provide client records to authorized representatives. Client interviewed stated staff would get upset when clients would speak up for each other. Client interview did not reveal that staff provoked inappropriate behaviors between minors nor prevented minors from using the restroom. The information obtained did not produce corroborating evidence to support the allegations. Thus, the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated, meaning although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. No deficiencies cited. Exit interview completed and a copy of this report was left with facility staff.",

See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated October 14, 2020. On April 24, 2020, the Department concluded a complaint investigation on S1 under this GH. The complaint alleged that C1 was involved in sexual acts with S1. S1 acknowledged performing lewd and lascivious sexual acts with two clients #1 (C1) and client #2 (C2), on two separate incidents, inside and outside the GH. The allegations were substantiated and the GH was cited for 84072(d)(10) Personal Rights. S1 willfully, on separate incidents, participated in multiple lewd acts with minors, by use of S1's employment with the GH. C1 and C2 sustained physical abuse as a result of the sexual encounters with S1. Based on the analysis of the interviews, the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for the physical abuse. The penal code section 288a(b)(1) and 288a(b)(2) defines sexual conduct with a minor as physical abuse. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute sexual assault. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health and Safety (H&S) code section 1548 (f)(1)(c), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2500.00. An exit interview was completed and appeal rights discussed.

    "narrative": "On November 16, 2021 at 6:50pm Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Nicole Strickland, met with Alpha Connection \u2013 Anoka Ranch, Administrator Evonnda Hull to deliver a case management deficiencies report. According to information obtained by Community Care Licensing (CCL) the facility submitted a Serious Incident Report (SIR) to CCL regarding an incident occurring at the facility on June 13, 2021. CCL has received information the SIR submitted does not accurately reflect the incident. The SIR notes C1 was escalated with both S1 and Staff #3 (S3). Confidential interviews reported this SIR was not accurate as Child #1 (C1) became escalated only with Staff #1 (S1) while inside the facility and then followed S1 outside to the dumpster. The report noted S3, S2, and S1 counseled C1, however confidential interviews confirmed S2 and S3 were attempting to de-escalte C1 but S1 was yelling and arguing back with C1 which continued to escalate C1. The report also notes that S3 was acting as lead during the restraint. Confidential interviews noted that in S3\u2019s attempts to de-escalte C1, C1 was informed if C1 did not de-escalte a restraint would be needed however this was done as part of the de-escalation process not as S3 taking lead on a possible imminent restraint. The SIR notes that due to C1\u2019s continued assault on staff, S3 and S1 placed C1 in an authorized ProAct laying down restraint. Confidential interviews reported this did not accurately reflect the situation. Confidential interviews reported as S2 and S3 were attempting to de-escalate C1, S1 came from the back/side knocking C1 and S2 to the ground, at which time S1 jumped on top of C1. Confidential interviews reported that once S1 was on top of C1 with his torso on C1\u2019s back S3 provided assistance by holding C1\u2019s legs to assist S1. Confidential interview reported S1 did not communicate that he was taking C1 to the ground and the way in which S1 took C1 to the ground are not are not consistent with how an approved Pro-Act restraint is initiated. The report notes that S4 was monitoring C1\u2019s breathing during the restraint. Confidential interviews reported that S4 was in the area and witnessed the incident, however, was not providing any assistance. ***CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE***\n\nThe SIR submitted to CCL notes that an approved Pro-Act restraint was used on C1. However, record review could not provide current Pro-Act training for S1. S1 initiating and/or participating in any restraint while S1\u2019s Pro-Act training is not up-to-date is a violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87095.65(e). Also noted on the SIR was prior to the incident between C1 and S1, C1 had injured C1\u2019s hand by punching a metal door, to which S2 was going to take C1 to the hospital to be evaluated. S1\u2019s approach to handling the situation coming from behind/side of C1 knocking C1 to the ground is a violation of ILS 87095.00(c)(5). Additionally, Program Director (PDir) who reviewed the SIR and submitted it to CCL along with Pro-Act training certifications failed to notice the date of S1\u2019s Pro-Act training. This failure to notice S1\u2019s Pro-Act training had not been maintained resulted in the facility being in violation of ILS 87095.65(f), as a corrective action plan was not initiated. Confidential interviews and photographs obtained noted the way in which C1 was knocked to the ground by S1 caused C1 to sustain a bloody nose, scratches to the arms, and a busted lip. These injuries were not noted on the SIR submitted to CCL as required by Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 87061(j)(6)(E). The SIR provided past types of behavior issues C1 had since arriving at the facility, however the history provided does not include all of the required information that is to be reported to CCL, including dates of previous incidents. This is a violation of ILS 87061(j)(3)(B)(1). Also noted missing from the SIR was information regarding actions taken by facility personnel in response to previous incidents as required by ILS 87061(j)(3)(B)(3). The facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87095.65(e). EMERGENCY INTERVENTION STAFF TRAINING (e) Staff must receive on-going training to maintain certification. The facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87095.00(c)(5). GENERAL PROVISIONS: (c)Short-term residential therapeutic program staff may be justified in using ***CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE***\n\nrestraints as an emergency intervention if all of the following conditions are met: (5) The child receiving the restraint has no known medical or physical condition due to which there is reason to believe that the use of restraint would endanger the child\u2019s health and safety or exacerbate the medical condition; The facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87095.65(f) EMERGENCY INTERVENTION STAFF TRAINING (f) When an inappropriate manual restraint technique is used during an emergency intervention, the licensee must develop a corrective action plan, and as part of the plan may require staff to repeat the appropriate emergency intervention training. The facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87061(j)(6)(E).

    "narrative": "On November 17, 2021 at 11:45 AM, Associate Governmental Program Analyst (AGPA) Kim Robinson met with the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Program Director, Amy Osborn, to assess an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP). On July 29, 2021, the Department concluded a complaint investigation alleging that Child Care Staff neglected to provide care and supervision to minors, resulting with a twelve-year-old child #1 (C1) sustaining serious physical abuse. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated November 17, 2021). The allegations were substantiated and the STRTP was cited under the Title 22 Regulations, Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. The investigative evidence gathered shows multiple clients engaging in physical altercations, both inside and outside the STRTP, without staff making any attempts to intervene and meet the needs of the children in care. Based on the analysis of the interviews and video footage, the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for STRTP staff neglecting to provide the care and supervision for children in care as required in the General Licensing Requirements. Section 11165.2 of the Penal Code defines severe neglect as negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child when a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare permits any child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health and Safety (H&S) code section 1548 (f)(1)(A), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,500.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights discussed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List, Appeal Rights, and a Civil Penalty Assessment - Serious Bodily Injury/Physical Abuse (Form 421-D) were provided to the program director.",

Confidential interviews reported instead of S1 deescalating C1, S1 was arguing with C1, which escalated the situation. Confidential interviews reported Staff #2 (S2) and Staff #3 (S3) were attempting to de-escalate both C1 and S1, as S1 and C1 continued to argue. Confidential interviews reported during the entire time S2 was attempting to de-escalate the situation, S1\u2019s actions of arguing and pushing C1 away in an aggressive manner, continued to escalate the situation resulting in S1 coming from the side/behind of C1, and knocking C1 to the ground. S1\u2019s action of knocking C1 to the ground caused C1\u2019s face and stomach to land on the gravel driveway where the incident occurred. Additionally, the manner in which S1 took C1 to the ground resulted in S2 to also falling to the ground as S2\u2019s arm was trapped between S1 and C1. Confidential interviews reported once C1 was on the ground S1 then jumped on top of C1\u2019s back landing with S1\u2019s torso on top of C1 and began banging C1\u2019s head on the rocks/gravel beneath him.

On April 11, 2022, the Department concluded a complaint investigation with allegations of STRTP staff neglecting to provide care and supervision to minors, resulting with one minor sustaining serious bodily injury from the assault of another minor. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated July 28, 2022). The allegations were determined substantiated. The STRTP was cited for the violation of Personal Rights from the Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), Section 87072(c)(11).

Penal Code Section 11165.2 defines severe neglect as negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child when a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare permits any child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty Law, Health and Safety (H&S) code section 1548 (f)(1)(A), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,500.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights discussed.

The following people were in attendance: Community Care Licensing (CCL) Regional Manager (RM) LaCresha Cook, Licensing Program Managers (LPMs) Christina Barnes, Cheraki Davis, Natasha Dunlop, Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Jose Gonzalez, Darlene Oseguera, Nicole Strictland, Joon Choi, California Department of Social Services Rates Oversight Manager Michael Ford, Foster Care Rate's Analyst Tera Tapp, CDSS Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) David Gutierrez, San Bernardino Behavioral Health Representative Diane Wolkenhauer, Social Services Practitioner (SSP) San Bernardino County Children Family Services (CFS) Amy Guisa, Andria Innerbichler, Supervising Social Services Practitioner (SSP) San Bernardino County Children Family Services (CFS) Nakila Hill, PSW San Diego County Residential Placement Ruth Cisneros, Fresno County Department of Behavior Health Lesby Flores, Sr DPO Riverside County Probation Juan Bretado, Imperial County Probation Raul Manriquez, Imperial County Children & Family Services Donald Fulton, Yuba County Child and Adult Protective Services Social Worker Jean Hobbs, Mendocino County Social Worker Supervisor Lindsey Coke, California Alliance for Child and Family Services Rich Weisgal, ACYFS Administrative staff, Chief Executive Officer Barron Wilson, Program Director/ Facility Administrator Amy Osborn, Facility Administrators Evonnda Hull, Guy Williams, Anthony Riley, Clinician Muarizo Assandri, Clinician, Mark Daniels, Cameron Wilson Special Assistant to the Executive Director. The following information was discussed: \u00b7 Substantiated complaints for all four Short Term Residential Therapeutic Programs (STRTPs) \u00b7 Current client census for all four STRTPs \u00b7 Application Denial Letter for STRTPs \u00b7 Appeal Rights for the denial of the applications \u00b7 Request for a Closure Plan \u00b7 STRTPs reverting back to Group Homes\n\nDuring the discussion RM Cook expressed concerns regarding eight substantiated complaints against the STRTPs since the previous informal office conference held on April 12, 2022. RM Cook discussed that the department had met and communicated with the licensee to resolve concerns about the operation of the STRTP programs, to ensure that the programs could meet the high-level requirements for STRTPs. However, despite the outcome of those interactions, Alpha Connection has demonstrated an inability to comply with the operative statutes and regulations. RM Cook explained the denial of the applications are based upon the licensee\u2019s failure to provide satisfactory evidence that they can meet or conform to the licensing requirements in the Health and Safety Code, Title 22 California Code of Regulations, and CDSS Short-Term Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards (\u201cILS\u201d). RM Cook also explained that the decision is based on the evidence set forth in the reports, statements, and other documentary evidence contained in the official files compiled by the department. RM Cook informed Alpha Connections Youth and Family Services (ACYFS) Chief Executive Office Barron Wilson and all participants on the virtual meeting that the department will be issuing ACYFS an application denial letter for all four of the Alpha Connections Youth and Family Services STRTP facilities that includes an allowance of adequate time to submit a closure plan to Community Care Licensing and the County placing agencies, and for appropriate placements for the youth to be assessed. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Barron Wilson expressed his disdain for RM Cook, his disappointments, frustrations, and concerns with the denial decision. RM Cook asked CEO Wilson if he wanted to convert back to Group Home operations once the applications are denied and CEO Wilson stated yes. RM Cook then explained the department would also begin the revocation process for the Group Home facilities once the STRTPs converted back to group homes. There was additional discussion from the STRTP representatives regarding their disdain for RM Cook and their opinions and frustrations regarding the complaint investigations, the effects on the clients in placement, and concerns with the denial decision. ACYFS and California Alliance consultant, Yuba County and Imperial County representatives voiced their positive reflections of working with ACYFS. RM Cook concluded the meeting by requesting the licensee to submit a closure plan in writing for all four ACYFS STRTP programs as soon as possible to Community Care Licensing. *******CONTINUED on LIC 809C*******\n\nThe facility was given 09/30/2022 as the date to close their STRTP program. Mr. Wilson is advised that a closure plan is needed which will include the following: 1. The licensee will notify all placing agencies of ACYFS closure. 2. The licensee will work with all placing agencies in a safe transition of all clients to other programs. 3. This plan will include the facility\u2019s plan of action and how the facility will work with the placing agencies to ensure that all clients are transitioned in a respectful and safe manner. 4. The licensee will notify their employees of ACYFS closure. 5. The closure date will be September 30, 2022. LPA Jose Gonzalez and LPM Cheraki Davis reviewed and discussed the report with CEO, Barron Wilson. A copy of this report was emailed to Barron Wilson for signature. A copy of the signed report will be placed in the facility file. Mr. Wilson refused to sign the LIC 809 document.

Confidential interviews reported that the facility staff are checking on the minors and providing supervision for the minors in care. Other confidential interviews revealed that the facility staff does not keep the minors engaged. Additional confidential interviews indicated that minors would leave staff supervision because the minors were not engaged. The Department also received an allegation that facility staff #1 (S1) is sleeping during work shifts. Confidential interviews reported that the minors are asleep and were not aware of S1 sleeping during the night shift. Confidential interviews indicated that the facility staff is not sleeping during work shifts. Confidential interviews reported that S1 and the other facility staff conduct headcounts every 10 minutes. Confidential interviews disclosed that S1 works the night shift at this home and another home. Other confidential interviews reported that S1 is sleeping during his designated time of working at the home.

    "narrative": "no health or safety violations were observed at the time on inspection. It was alleged that on or around 07/07/22, staff confiscated C1\u2019s belongings and staff spit on C1. It was reported staff spit on C1 and staff took C1\u2019s belongings. Several witness statements corroborate that staff do not confiscate facility client\u2019s belongings, however, several witnesses also corroborate staff will confiscate drug or alcohol paraphernalia when client\u2019s AWOL and then return to the facility and are observed with these things. Other witnesses corroborate that staff might sometimes take away things like cell phones as consequences, however, all witnesses corroborate the items are returned in a timely manner and not simply \u201ctaken away\u201d. Several other witnesses corroborate they have never had their personal property confiscated by staff and not returned to them. Additionally, while one witness maintains a staff did spit on a client, no details were provided as to which staff or which client were involved in this incident, or when it occurred. Several witnesses deny any staff ever spitting on any clients. All staff interviewed deny these allegations. While another witness maintains the allegations are true, several witnesses deny ever observing these allegations occur. Based on interviews conducted, the allegations that staff confiscated C1\u2019s belongings and staff spit on C1 may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights, were provided to FM, Nancy McCarthy, for original signature. Signed report will be placed in facility file.",

Confidential interviews revealed staff do not restrain clients and FD has not been observed to place her arm on C1\u2019s neck or pull C1\u2019s hair. Further confidential interviews revealed if a client is being physical with another client staff will separate the clients by pulling them apart however staff does not restrain clients. Confidential interviews with both staff and clients revealed staff intervene by placing themselves in between clients so that clients cannot harm each other. Confidential interviews with staff also revealed staff separate clients, use verbal de-escalation and incentives to get clients to calm down. Other confidential interviews revealed FD and other staff have had to restrain C1 on one occasion when C1 was attempting to commit suicide and grab anything C1 could to hurt C1\u2019s self. Additionally, interviews revealed staff has had to get a butter knife out of C1\u2019s hand when C1 has said C1 was going to hurt C1\u2019s self but did not restrain C1.

On July 13, 2022, the Department concluded a complaint investigation of allegations that a seventeen-year-old client (C1) suffered acute ethanol intoxication, resulting with emergency hospitalization. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated August 18, 2022). The allegations were substantiated and the STRTP was cited under the Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87072(c) Personal Rights and 87065.2 (b)(1) Personnel Duties with a $500.00 immediate civil penalty assessment. The investigative evidence gathered shows Alpha Connection \u2013 Nisqually Nest (AC-NN) staff neglected to supervise and provide timely medical care of C1, allowing a situation that endangered the health of C1. Based on the analysis of the medical reports and interviews, the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for STRTP staff neglecting to supervise and provide timely medical care to ensure the well-being of all minors in care as required in the Interim Licensing Standards. Section 11165.2 of the Penal Code defines neglect as negligent treatment or the maltreatment of a child by a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare under circumstances indicating harm or threatened harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health and Safety (H&S) code section 1548 (f)(1)(A), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,000.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights discussed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List, Appeal Rights, and a Civil Penalty Assessment - Serious Bodily Injury/Physical Abuse (Form 421-D) were provided to the administrator.",

Information obtained from confidential interviews disclosed that staff would not always address clients who were smoking. Confidential interviews stated that when staff chose to address clients smoking on facility grounds, staff would direct clients to smoke outside or to open the window at the facility. The facility addressed the issue of clients smoking on grounds by providing additional staff trainings. An additional allegation alleging staff did not report an incident involving a minor was received by CCL. Record review was unable to provide evidence of the facility reporting Child #3 (C3) and Child #8 (C8) going AWOL on April 25, 2022. Record review revealed the facility submitted an incident report noting C3 and C8 were returned to the facility on April 27, 2022 after being AWOL for two days. A review of the facilities communication log/running log revealed on April 25, 2022 C3 and C8 left the facility at @ 6:45pm and were considered AWOL. Additional record review was unable to provide evidence that the 14 separate instances regarding the allegation of staff allowing minors to do drugs in the facility where (Child #1 [C1], Child #3 [C3], Child #5 [C5], Child #8 [C8], and/or Child #9 [C9]) were observed smoking in the facility were reported as required. Two additional allegations alleging staff called minors inappropriate names and staff (Administrator [ADM]), made inappropriate comments towards minors was also received by CCL. Specifically it was reported Child #5 (C5) was having an issue with school and when C5 addressed the issue with staff and ADM, ADM told C5 \u201ctell someone who cares.\u201d Additional confidential interviews provided consistent statements of ADM referring to and calling at least three minors (Child #1 [C1]), Child #3 [C3] and C5) as sluts, hoes, and b*****s. Confidential interviews further reported when ADM would attempt to confiscate the minors contraband ADM was heard saying \u201cgive me the s**t, you nasty slut.\u201d An additional allegation was received by CCL alleging staff withheld minor\u2019s (Child #5 [C5]) allowance. Specific information as to which staff withheld the minor\u2019s allowance was not disclosed. Confidential interviews reported in March of 2022, C5 had C5\u2019s allowance withheld for talking with CPS, CWS, or licensing. Record review could not confirm C5 receiving C5\u2019s allowance for the week of March 9, 2022, April 6, 2022 and April 20, 2022. ***CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE***\n\nBased on confidential interviews and record review the allegations of Staff allowing minors to do drugs in the facility, Staff did not report an incident involving a minor, Staff called minors inappropriate names, Staff made inappropriate comments towards minors, and Staff withheld minor\u2019s allowance are substantiated. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met. This is a violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87087 BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 87087(c) The Licensee shall prohibit smoking in the facility and on the grounds of the facility; ILS standard 87061 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 87061(b)(4) Any unusual absence or failure of a child to return or inform the facility that they are not returning for a specified period of time; two violations of ILS standard 87072 PERSONAL RIGHTS 87072(c)(10) To be accorded dignity in their personal relationships with staff and other persons and 87072 PERSONAL RIGHTS 87072(c)(18) To receive an allowance.

Additional confidential interviews confirmed the residents use of marijuana and/or methamphetamine however, denied knowledge of staff providing the illegal drugs to minors stating they are not sure how and where the residents obtained the illegal drugs. Two additional allegations alleging staff (Staff #4 [S4]) hit minor (Child #5 [C5]) and staff (S4) restrained minor (C5) were received by CCL. Specifically it was reported S4 hit C5 in the face and put her in a choke hold; unknown date of incident. Record review and confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute these allegations. Confidential interviews reported that the facility does not go hands on when there are issues at the facility. Conflicting confidential interviews reported the facility only restrains as a last resort. Confidential interviews reported C5 \u201cwent off\u201d on S4 hitting and kicking and even spitting on S4 . Confidential interviews reported S4 was attempting to restrain C5 in order to protect S4 and hit C5 during the restraint. Record review revealed an incident between S4 and C5 occurred on 4/8/2022 where C5 hit S4, however there is no documentation that S4 attempted to restrain C5 during the incident. An additional allegation was received by CCL alleging minors are forced out of the facility. Specific information as to which staff force minors out of facility was not disclosed, however it was disclosed that minors are forced out in order for Child Protective Services (CPS), County Social Workers (CSW), or licensing not to have the opportunity to speak with minors. Confidential interviews provided conflicting statements regarding staff forcing minors out of the facility. Confidential interviews reported that once the facility is aware that CPS, CWS, or licensing is in the area staff contact administration and then are directed by administration to take residents on impromptu outings. Confidential interviews reported impromptu outings include going to get ice cream, going to IHop or to the store. Additional confidential interviews deny the allegation and report residents are only taken on approved outings. An additional allegation alleging Staff (Administrator [ADM]) harassed minor (C5). Specifically it was reported that ADM would purposely attempt to get a reaction from C5 by touching and moving C5\u2019s belongings. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute ADM harassing C5. Confidential interviews reported many of the residents would claim to feel harassed when staff are attempting to redirect them or providing residents with reminders to stick to the program. Conflicting confidential interviews reported that staff\u2019s, specifically ADM\u2019s redirection and/or reminders were more than just redirection or\n\nsimple reminders as staff including ADM would include inappropriate comments and inappropriate names when talking with minors. Based on record review and confidential interviews the allegations staff provided illegal drugs to minors, staff (Staff #4 [S4]) hit minor (Child #5 [C5]), staff (S4) restrained minor (C5), minors are forced out of the facility, and staff (Administrator [ADM]) harassed minor (C5), may or may not have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by the evidence.

    "narrative": "It was reported that staff provided incentives to older clients for disciplining younger clients with physical violence, causing clients to be fearful and distressed. It was further reported that Staff #1 (S1) punched Client #1 (C1) in the face and slammed the client on the sofa. Confidential interviews and reports received for the investigation resulted in consistent information provided to Investigator Hudec. Investigator Hudec\u2019s interview with S1 disclosed that he was not trained in Pro-Act, which is Professional Assault Crisis Training. Director Barron Wilson specified that all staff are Pro-Act trained, even though multiple staff specified they had not been Pro-Act trained as of hire. S1 confirmed there was a physical altercation between he and C1. Due to another staff removing C1\u2019s bedcovers, C1 became agitated. S1 stated he attempted to verbally deescalate the situation; however, C1 threatened and cursed at staff. A \u201cscuffle\u201d ensued. S1 stated he pushed C1 and made contact with C1\u2019s cheek, causing the client to fall. S1 also stated he held C1 down as C1 attempted to hit him in the head and another client attempted to pull S1 off C1. Additional staff interviewed for the investigation witnessed S1 \u201cchoke\u201d and punch C1 in the face. Also, staff specified S1 was upset that the clients were \u201cmean to him\u201d and made the comment that \u201cnext time they get in my face and push me, I will start swinging.\u201d Witnesses attested to seeing C1 lying on the floor with S1 on top of the client with both their arms \u201cflailing\u201d during the physical altercation. It was also indicated that S1 became agitated very quickly and always \u201cballed his fists\u201d at clients. Current and former staff revealed to Investigator Hudec that there are \u201cAlpha\u201d clients at each facility. These \u201cAlphas\u201d are required to keep other clients \u201cin line.\u201d Staff has observed an older client hitting the younger clients and indicated that clients have received extra money on their birthdays and may receive incentives from corporate. Witnesses confirmed there is at least one client labeled \u201cAlpha\u201d who had received extra money in their allowance as a result of maintaining compliance among the younger clients. On at least one occasion, an Alpha client made the other clients line up in the living room and punched them once in the chest as a form of discipline. Witnesses reported the Alpha had scared and yelled at the clients and taken their phones or other electronic devices when they have stepped \u201cout of line.\u201d Witnesses also reported that staff has \u201cbribed\u201d two clients with an iPhone, Jordan sneakers, and a gaming system to keep the other clients compliant. It was additionally indicated that staff asked the clients to steal and break other clients\u2019 phone or \u201cbeat them up\u201d if they were \u201cacting up\u201d or \u201cmess up\u201d the facility. Moreover, Investigator Hudec\u2019s interview with social workers disclosed being concerned with the operation of the facility. (next page)\n\nBased on confidential witnesses and record review, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met and the allegation that staff are manipulating group home children as well as causing group home children to be physically and emotionally harmed, and staff member had a physical altercation with group home child(ren) has been substantiated, which poses an immediate Health, Safety, or Personal Rights risk to children in care. Facility is cited for Title 22 Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(10) Personal Rights and 84072(d)(11) Personal Rights. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and Appeals Rights were provided to Mr. Encinas, Facility Manager.\n\nIt was reported that clients were not checked on for several hours, and a client was able to bring a gun into the facility because staff cannot supervise properly. It was additionally reported that the clients may have been physically and sexually abused as Staff #1 (S1) removed the bedcovers off clients and touched them at night. Confidential interviews and reports received for the investigation resulted in inconsistent information provided to Investigator Hudec. Several former and current staff interviewed for the investigation indicated that two staff are present during each shift, and the ratio is 1:3. Staff are required to check on clients every ten minutes and document the checks. Other staff indicated there is only one staff present during the overnight shifts. In an interview with Investigator Hudec, S1 denied touching the clients and specified that he shook the clients\u2019 bed and called their names to awaken them. However, multiple staff disclosed they have woken up clients by touching them, either on their shoulders or legs. Others disclosed they have awakened clients by removing their bedcovers. Witnesses confirmed all methods staff disclosed for awakening the clients. Furthermore, staff interviewed by Investigator Hudec disclosed hearing rumors of a gun being found in the facility but denied a gun was ever located. However, a witness disclosed a revolver was observed in an air vent and handed over to staff. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that facility is understaffed and neglecting adequate supervision of the group home children, group home child had access to a gun, and staff member inappropriately touched group home children, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and Appeals Rights were provided to Mr. Encinas.",

LPA Phillips was provided a daily food log listing all food and amounts consumed by Child #1. It was reported to LPA Phillips that the facility is making every effort to meet the needs of Child #1 but admit Child #1 requires a higher level of care. During the confidential interviews it was reported to LPA Phillips that Child #1 is hard to place and lack of funding to being a minor. Due to inconsistent statements LPA Phillips was not able to determine if the above said allegations occurred, therefore the allegations were found to be Unsubstantiated meaning that although the allegations may have happened or are valid there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged incidents occurred. No deficiencies cited at the time of this investigation. Exit interview was conducted, and copy of the report will be left with facility administrator.",

Spectrum tried to do some resets and reboots remotely, which did not work. Staff explained that neither they nor Spectrum could figure out the phone problem. Spectrum shared that they could not come out to service the phone until 4/3/25. The facility did not want to wait, so they just replaced the phone, which is now in working order.

    "narrative": "Evidence obtained from records noted that C1 was admitted to the facility with a belt that was stored in a designated storage area. Evidence obtained from records noted that on 04/19/24, C1 was permitted to wear a belt when they asked for it in the morning but had to return it to staff before bed. Statements obtained revealed C1 was given their belt either on 04/17/24 or 04/24/24. However, statements obtained could not corroborate if or when the belt was collected from C1 at the end of the day. The investigation revealed on the evening of 4/24/2024, during a designated supervised shower time, C1 was monitored with verbal communication by staff during a 7-minute time span for C1\u2019s shower. Statements revealed, C1 requested more time and was given an additional two minutes. After the two minutes passed, staff knocked on the door and did not get a response from C1. When staff opened the bathroom door, C1 was found unresponsive, with their neck hung with a belt on a shower rail. Staff on duty brought C1 down and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until paramedics arrived. C1 was resuscitated, transported to the hospital, intubated, and diagnosed with Hypoxia. Statements obtained did not determine the length of time C1 was unresponsive to staff\u2019s knocks at the bathroom door, or length of time it took for staff to get C1 down. Statements revealed inconsistent accounts of staff conducting a search of C1 and bathroom areas prior to the incident. Statements revealed witness corroborating accounts of C1 wearing a belt the day of the incident and the days leading up to the incident on 4/24/2024. Based on confidential interviews, record review, and analysis of circumstances, the Department has determined that the preponderance of evidence standard has been met; therefore, the allegation that staff did not provide necessary care and supervision to C1 resulting in C1\u2019s attempted suicide by hanging with a belt while in care is substantiated. This poses an immediate health, safety, and personal rights risk of harm to clients placed in care. The facility is issued a citation in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, 84078(b) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. See page LIC9099-D for the cited deficiency. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights discussed. A copy of this report and appeal rights was left with Administrator.

    "narrative": "Client interviews shared that while the facility is on a farm, the facility is not dirty nor does it have an odor. Clients testified that a professional cleaning crew come at least twice a week, and that there are no complaints of a smell. Clients also shared during their interviews that while the facility was prepared to evacuate in January, they never left the facility. The evacuation was canceled, the area was safe, and no clients ever left the facility. Clients also stated that the outside facility grounds are generally well lit even at night. LPA interviewed several facility staff members who also testified that the facility does provide onboarding training to new hires, specifically called the \u201cAscend Academy\u201d. All staff shared that they attended the training prior to starting their work at the facility. LPA performed record reviews and observed that the training happened monthly and never took a break or was postponed. All staff confirmed that there are also monthly trainings provided by the facility, with reminders actively sent leading up to the trainings. LPA was also informed by staff interviews that mentor shadowing is provided beforehand for new hires to learn and ask questions about their work. Staff interviews also stated that the facility has professional cleaners come 2-4 times a week, while clients do chores regularly, and staff also perform general housekeeping duties. Staff interviews shared that there has never been a complaint or issue with odors in the house. Staff interviews testified that the facility has exterior lights all around the grounds, including the porch. LPA performed a facility walkthrough and specifically observed the porch lights to be in working condition. Staff shared that they have never heard of any on-the-job injury recently, and that there is no workers' comp case open at the moment. Staff interviews also corroborated that the facility never had to evacuate in January during the fires. LPA reviewed receipt records showing that the facility was prepared to evacuate to a local Hyatt hotel for emergency procedures, not an unlicensed facility. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding all the allegations against the facility. Interview evidence and records review of the roster for the previous \u201cAscend Academy\u201d meetings show that the training was being provided and was never canceled or postponed. Interview evidence from the client and staff shared that the facility is free of odors due to weekly professional and general house cleaning. Interview and observation evidence showed that the facility's exterior lights were in working condition. Interview evidence and records review in the form of the hotel receipts show that the facility never evacuated to an unlicensed location, and if the facility needed to evacuate they were prepared to go to an approved emergency location. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, records review, and observation evidence the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegations that the \u201cFacility did not ensure that staff are trained, Facility has an odor, Staff did not ensure that facility has adequate lighting, & Facility served clients at an unlicensed location.\u201d is found to be unsubstantiated.\n\nAn exit interview was conducted, during which LPA provided the Facility Manager with a copy of this report and a copy of their appeal rights.",

LPA also toured the facility and observed the building and grounds.

Witness testimony also alleged that the facility has an odor and is not properly cleaned. Witness interview stated that the facility is not properly lit outside, specifically the front porch, which resulted in an on-the-job injury. Witness interview also shared that during the fires in the area earlier in the year, the facility had to evacuate and did not evacuate to an approved emergency site like a nearby hotel, but went to another facility that had not been licensed yet to serve and care for clients.

LPA met with Facility Manager Cesar Redoloso and informed of the purpose of the visit. LPA used the CARE Inspection Tool to conduct the inspection. There are three residents in care, and all were at school during the visit. The facility is a house in a residential neighborhood and has three double-occupancy resident bedrooms and one staff room, two bathrooms, kitchen/dining/living space and outdoor activity space.

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, and Trauma informed safety plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Canal observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.
