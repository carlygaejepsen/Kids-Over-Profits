Both parties met to discuss recent neighborhood complaints at the Arena location at 5530 Johnston Rd., Pleasanton, CA. During this meeting, representatives of Arena explained the ongoing issues with the facility's neighbor, who shares an easement on the driveway with the facility. There is a coded gate at the entrance to the driveway, and the neighbor has been consistently complaining about the volume of cars that go in and out of the gate to the facility each day and through the night. Both parties discussed solutions for this issue, and it was decided that all neighborhood complaints would be forwarded to LPA Fremont going forward to keep an eye on the situation. Newport Academy also discussed attempts they had made at rectifying this situation, including but not limited to building a fence for the neighbor to maintain privacy and buying the neighbor's house at a high cost to allow the neighbor to move to another area. Both parties will be keeping an eye on the situation and updating the other periodically until a solution is decided. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was emailed to Newport Academy representatives. Due to this meeting being conducted virtually, no facility representative signature was recorded.",

LPA met with Residential Supervisor Gordo Mahal, who helped facilitate this inspection. Currently in care are 6 ambulatory clients. On 02/09/2023, the San Jose Children's Resdiential Program Regional Office received a complaint for Newport Academy Arena with three allegations: (1) Facility is providing care and supervision to youths that do not reside at the home; (2) Facility is catering food to other facilities and not appropriately handled; and (3) Facility is not following plan of operation with laundry. This complaint was investigated by LPA Madi Fremont and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong. Over the course of this investigation, LPA Fremont and LPM Wong interviewed 4 staff and 1 client at the facility. Based on these interviews, it was found that the facility provides schooling for another group home, Newport Academy Oasis, 5 days per week from 8am-12pm. When clients from Oasis come to Arena for schooling, they are accompanied by residential counselors and clinical staff to make sure staff/client ratios are maintained. It was also found that Newport Arena provides meals to the Oasis facility, which are delivered by facility van each day. Newport Arena only provides laundry services for clients in care are Arena, and no laundry is sent out for cleaning. This agency has investigated the allegations (1) Facility is providing care and supervision to youths that do not reside at the home; (2) Facility is catering food to other facilities and not appropriately handled; and (3) Facility is not following plan of operation with laundry, and has found that although the allegations may be true or are valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated based on review of facility records and interviews with staff and client that show the facility is following its operating standards. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was emailed to Residential Supervisor Gordo Mahal, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA Fremont and LPM Wong conducted multiple interviews with witnesses and facility did not have more than 6 clients in placement. Client Census Records were reviewed, facility had between 5 to 6 clients for this facility between April and May of 2023. Based on records and interviews, there was no information that support the allegation that the facility is over capacity where there are more that 6 clients. Several months ago there were some clients from another facility visited this facility for several hours in the morning for school but stopped several weeks ago and now they stay at their facility for school. Although, the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that this facility is over capacity. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated. Exit interview was conducted with ED Pamela Alba and VP Rebecca Whitehead.",

The incident report that was sent was erroneous and stated that the incident occurred outside the facility, which is incorrect according to record review of the CPS report and four confidential interviews. This poses a potential risk to the health, safety, and/or personal rights of the clients in care. LPA delivered a Type B citation for California Code of Regulations Title 22 80061(b) (see LIC9099D). Facility did not respond to authorized representatives in a timely manner. Based on three confidential interviews, record review of email correspondence, and review of the incident reports the facility had not reported self-harm that received medical treatment from facility nurse to the authorized representatives. According to confidential interview and record review, an incident had occurred regarding two clients on 2/10/2023 which was not communicated to the authorized representatives until 2/13/2023. This poses a potential risk to the health, safety, and/or personal rights of the clients in care. LPA delivered a Type B citation for California Code of Regulations Title 22 80061(A)(f) (see LIC9099D).\n\nAuthorized representatives were not offered the chance to participate in the development of a client's needs and services plan. Based on two confidential interviews and email statement from the facility staff, there was no evidence that authorized representatives were offered the chance to participate in the development of a client\u2019s treatment plan. According to the facility protocol, the treatment plan should be signed by the authorized representative, based on email from facility staff this protocol had not been followed during C1\u2019s intake process. This poses a potential risk to the health, safety and/or personal rights of the clients in care. LPA delivered a Type B citation for California Code of Regulations Title 22 Chapter 5 84068.2(d)(1) (see LIC9099D). Medication was not given as ordered by a physician. Based on record review of the Medication Administration Log and one confidential interview, C1\u2019s medication was not supplied on the evening of 3/13/2023. There was no explanation provided for the missing medication and according to confidential interview the prescribing doctor was not informed of the missed medication. This poses a potential risk to the health, safety, and/or personal rights of the clients in care. LPA delivered a Type B citation for California Code of Regulations Title 22 Chapter 5 84070(b)(13) (see LIC9099D). LPA provided the facility the appeal rights and discussed the plan of correction for each violation. LPA conducted an exit interview with Rayjay Peralta, Residential Supervisor, whose signature confirms the receipt of this document.\n\nPsychotropic medication administered without prior parental authorization. According to interview with the reporting party, this allegation was not a concern. Based on three confidential interviews, the facility had received approval for the psychotropic medications administered and for a dosage change during C1\u2019s stay. Facility did not offer authorized representatives the opportunity to participate in a client's discharge planning. According to four confidential interviews, the facility staff\u2019s protocol would be to create a discharge plan as a clinical team and communicate this to the youth and authorized representatives. Per the confidential interviews, the team would not change their formal discharge summary based on authorized representatives\u2019 input, but they would accommodate the discharge planning that worked for the individual provided the authorized representatives thoughts. The facility had provided a discharge plan on C1\u2019s discharge plan that was not consistent with the authorized representative\u2019s collaboration. Based on record review of emails between authorized representatives and the facility staff, the facility staff had assisted C1 in seeking other options for discharge that were consistent with the authorized representatives\u2019 preferences. PRN medications not administered to a client when needed. Based on record review of the medication logs, there were not PRN medications prescribed that were not administered when necessary. According to two confidential interviews, there were PRN medications that might have been necessary at times, but there was not a prescription for the medications during C1\u2019s stay. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the following allegations may or may not have happened: - Psychotropic medication administered without prior parental authorization. - Facility did not offer authorized representatives the opportunity to participate in client\u2019s discharge planning. - PRN medications not administered to a client when needed. These three allegations have not met the preponderance of doubt and are therefore unsubstantiated. LPA conducted an exit interview with Rayjay Peralta, Residential Supervisor at 1:50PM whose signature confirms the receipt of this document.",

    "narrative": "On 5/25/23, at 1:00pm, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Nancy O'Connell conducted an unannounced Case Management- deficiencies inspection to the above-listed facility. LPA was met by the Residential Supervisor who provided access to the facility. On 5/17/23, the Department received information that an unapproved alteration was made to the physical environment of the facility. Specifically, the therapy office located on the first floor was converted into a client bedroom, and the adjoining fire exit door was locked, preventing free access to exit the facility in the event of an emergency. Evidence of the violation is retained in Department records. On 5/18/23, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Nancy O'Connell and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Kevin Sauk contacted the Residential Program Manager (RPM), Mydori Saipale to inquire about the alteration made to the door in the therapy office/client bedroom. LPM asked if the door was altered to prevent free access to exit, and RPM explained that the could still be exited and had not be changed to prevent free access.LPM informed RPM that if that emergency exit door in the therapist office has a lock requiring a key, it would need to be removed immediately. RPM agreed. During the inspection on 5/25/23, LPA conducted a walk through of the facility with S1 and upon inspection of the pool area, LPA and S1 observed the pool gate to be open, allowing access to the pool and spa. Further, the pool gate door is set up to swing inward towards the pool. Lastly, LPA walked the perimeter of the pool gate and observed the mesh gate panels to be non-secure, allowing for hooks to be unlatched, and providing access to the pool. S1 observed gate and agreed that the pool is accessible to clients. LPA inquired about reason for gate not being secured and S1 stated she wasnt sure why the gate was not secured and believed maintenance reinstalled the gate incorrectly. LPA retained photos for evidence and informed S1 that a deficiency would be cited. PER California Code Regulation, TITLE 22, DIVISION 6, CHAPTERS 1, General Licensing Regulations, there are three deficiencies to be cited at this time. See LIC809D for detials.

LPA discussed the documentation in the incident report that was submitted in that it appears that the facility discharged the youth without attempting to mitigate the removal of the youth and without a seven day notice to the placing agency per the program statement that was approved by the Department. LPA discussed with the administrator that when discharging a youth, the facility needs to provide a written seven day notice to the client's guardian and/or placing agency. LPA explained that there are circumstances when a youth should be discharged under emergency situations and that would be removal by law enforcement, hospitalization or other emergent situations. In this particular incident, LPA sees that a youth was discharged but there does not appear to be any other incidents involving this youth nor does it appear that the youth failed to calm down or take space after speaking with law enforcement. While discussing the incident with Ms. Bertolino, LPA was informed that there have been other issues of aggression with this youth but that it did not rise to the level of a report to Licensing. LPA informed the facility that providing all of the information and information utilized to reach the conclusion is necessary for the Department to understand and ensure that the facility is following their own program statement. Ms. Bertolino states that she will ensure that the incident reports moving forward are more comprehensive and have the information necessary that lead the facility to reach the conclusion that was reached.

    "narrative": "During interviews with the Residential Supervisor, Residential Manager, and therapist in the facility, it was reported that C1 had a history of making false statements against and targeting peers prior to being placed at this facility. Staff stated C1 was a resident at another facility for this agency and was moved to this location in hopes to allow C1 to make a new start in a fresh environment. Knowing C1's history, C1 was placed on heightened supervision since their arrival to this facility but not on a one-to-one supervision. Staff admitted that the supervision for C1 was not elevated to one to one as the previous false statements against peers was not of a sexual nature prior to their placement. Staff were aware that C1 needed to be closely monitored. During the approximately one week where C1 and C2 were roommates, the facility did only have one staff supervising youth during the overnight hours and the overnight staff had other duties to be completed during their shift that would take them away from the area where the clients' rooms were located. This left the client rooms unsupervised for periods of 10 to 15 minutes. Confidential interviews with overnight staff indicated that once they became aware of the allegation, they ensured that the area where client rooms were located was never left unsupervised, even for restroom breaks or other rest periods. Overnight staff interview indicated that both youth were sounds sleepers and that there was never a time that youth were awake or woke up while they worked the overnight shift, including the night(s) the alleged allegation occurred. Confidential interviews with youth were not consistent on whether there was any sexual contact between them. As a result of the information obtained and reviewed and interview conducted, the allegation that a lack of supervision resulted in an inappropriate interaction between youth is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted and documents, including appeal rights, were provided to Mr. Parraz.",

LPA Hill informed Ms. Saravia that the inspection is being conducted as a result of an incident report dated 6/20/25 in which C1 (see LIC811 dated 7/3/25) allegedly found an item on the facility grounds that may be dangerous to youth in care. In addition, the incident report details C1 being \"wanded\" and required to do a \"contraband dance\" as a result of the find. LPA Hill discussed the incident with staff including supervision at the time of the \"find\". It was reported that C1 was within eyesight of staff when C1 found the item(s) and turned them over to staff. C1 was \"wanded\" which includes a search of C1's person with the use of a metal detecting wand and C1 was required to perform a \"contraband dance\" which includes turning out of their pockets, and jumping up to ensure that youth did not have any unauthorized items that may come loose or drop. These actions could be seen as potential violations of C1's right to be free of unreasonable searches and as a result, the facility was issued an Advisory Note for Personal Rights. In addition, LPA Hill informed Ms. Saravia that in review of the Plan of Operation approved for the agency, a \"contraband dance\" was not articulated and thus not approved by Community Care Licensing. Facility was cited for violation of Title 22, Section 80022(b)(1) Plan of Operation as the agency is required to have a plan of operation that includes program methods including how, when and under what circumstances searches are to be conducted and this policy must be approved by Community Care Licensing.

Due to COVID-19 protocols the visit was conducted by phone with Holvis Delgadillo, Program Director, and Princess Garcia, Program Manager (East Bay). On 9/14/2020, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Zaid Hakim, and LPAs Cheyenne McCambridge, David Hiett, and Brian Bertoli, conducted a meeting with the above facility. Due to the current COVID-19 protocols, the meeting was conducted via conference call. In attendance for the facility were: Dr Jennifer Dragonette, Executive Director, Crystal Goodwin, Compliance Specialist, Holvis Delgadillo, Program Director, Boe Roberts, Clinical Director (Marin), Princess Garcia, Program Manager (East Bay), and Gretchel Relota, Program Manager (Marin). The purpose of the meeting was to review the facility practices and Program Statement regarding phone use by clients. LPAs Bertoli and McCambridge had determined prior to the meeting, via staff and client interviews, that phone calls were restricted by time and they were not allowed privacy, including calls with family members. LPA Hiett determined that this practice was described in the facility Program Statement. LPM Hakim stated that despite prior approval by CCL, this practice was contrary to Title 22 regulations and would need to be amended. Facility representatives acknowledged that they were aware of this issue and would be working on revisions that would be consistent and in compliance with the regulations. LPM Hakim and CCL staff acknowledged that while there are program differences within private pay group homes and that these facilities are granted more latitude in some areas of client personal rights, these should not include facility wide practices that impose restrictions that directly contradict the regulations or that can be considered unreasonable. With respect to the facilities\u2019 therapeutic and/or clinical expertise, these instances should be evaluated and documented on a case by case basis. LPM Hakim summarized that CCL would help facilitate the revisions. (continued on LIC809-C dated 9/22/2020)\n\n(continued from LIC809 dated 9/22/2020) LPA Bertoli issued a Technical Violation per Title 22 Regulations for section 84072 Personal Rights (d)(8) (see LIC9102TV dated 9/22/2020).

    "narrative": "At 10:45AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madeleine Fremont traveled to the home above for the purpose of conducting an unannounced combined Required Annual and Post-Licensing Inspection. LPA met with Director Princess Garcia and Program Manager Vandenbelt, who helped facilitate this inspection. Currently in care are five ambulatory clients. During this visit, LPA Fremont toured the home inside and out. The home is located at 7210 Johnston Road in Pleasanton, California. The home has a long private driveway off Johnston Road with an automatic gate at the bottom of the drive. The entry road opens up to a large front courtyard with a circle driveway and fountain, which is non-operable and has been turned into a large planter for flowers and cacti. The home is a two story structure with 4 client bedrooms, 4 client bathrooms, several staff and therapist offices, a kitchen, nurse's station, family room, dining room, gym, and a family visit room which is also utilized as a COVID-19 isolation room when needed. LPA toured the backyard first, exiting through sliding double doors located in the kitchen/breakfast area. These doors open out to a covered patio which has a stone fire pit and outdoor kitchen area. Neither the fire pit nore the outdoor kitchen area are used by clients or staff. The fire pit is surrounded by a low stone wall and has chairs for clients to sit outside. Down a small set of stairs from the patio, there is a pool, hot tub, and a tennis court further into the backyard. The pool and hot tub are covered by a netted cover and enclosed by a fence and gate with a self-latching closure. The tennis court is also surrounded by a fence with a self-latching gate. Next to the pool, there is a sitting area with hammocks, benches, and cushioned chairs for client leisure. The pool, hot tub, and sitting area are surrounded by a retaining wall and gate, and beyond this there is a landscaped area with cacti and trees that extends to the edge of the property, and is also enclosed by an iron fence.\n\nOn the far side of the sitting area, there is a self-latching gate which remains locked. Beyond this gate, there are two permitted sheds which are used as therapists offices, and beyond these are the air conditioning units and natural gas storage tanks, which are also beyond locked fences and remain inaccessible to clients. From this area, there is another gate that opens back out to the driveway, where there are two 2-car garages. The garage has been converted into a gym and art/recreation room for the clients to utilize during free time. LPA observed each client bedroom to be comfortably furnished with more than the required amount of space for each client to store personal belongings. In the hallway closet outside of the client bedrooms, LPA observed extra linens including bed sheets and towels. Through the front door of the home, there is a foyer which has a staff office, as well as a check-in station where visitors and staff can check their temperature and sign in. Also in this area, the facility license, accreditations, Medi-Cal certifications, floor plan, personal rights, grievance policy, emergency disaster plan, and all other required signage are posted on the wall above the check-in station. During this inspection, LPA Fremont reviewed 5 client files and 5 staff files. All files were complete with all required documentation. LPA inspected the nurse's station where client medications are stored, and observed a separate locked cabinet for each of the clients' medications. All psychotropic medications were accompanied by required documentation. The nurse's station is kept locked, and inaccessible to clients. First aid kits were observed in the kitchen, garage, and nurse's station. In the kitchen, LPA observed at least 2 days of perishable foods and at least 7 days of nonperishable foods. Facility menu was posted on the kitchen counter. Emergency food supply was observed in the kitchen pantry. Fire extinguishers were observed in the garage, kitchen, upstairs hallway, abnd backyard, and all were inspected and observed to be in working order.

The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the individualized safety plan and treatment plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom and LPM King observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Director Priscilla Hernandez.",

C1 made and received calls at the facility per her parent. Staff had discussion with youth that parent may want them to go to another facility, but there was no indication that staff misled youth. C1's parent indicated that she had sent a message to the youth the night before the discharge occurred and she didn't think she ever got it. There is a lack of evidence to make a determination as to whether a regulatory violation did occur.

    "narrative": "...CONTINUED Confidential interviews indicated that staff encourage clients to follow the program schedule but do not deny clients meals. Confidential interviews and record review of an incident report and C1\u2019s clinical notes indicated that C1 would become fixated on procedures around serving breakfast, and that C1 unfairly accused staff of violating C1\u2019s rights. CCL also received the allegation that staff (unnamed) denied minor (C1) a shower. It was reported that staff denied C1 access to their shower soap if C1 wanted to shower at night and as a result C1 was unable to shower for two weeks. Confidential interviews and a review of C1's treatment plan indicated that staff held soap for C1 and provided prescribed amounts to C1 in accordance with clinical recommendations. A confidential interview indicated that C1 was denied their shower soap when C1 wanted to shower at 9:00 PM because the scheduled time to shower is in the mornings. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that clients are provided shower soap in the morning and evening for scheduled hygiene times. Confidential interviews indicated that staff encourage clients to shower during the scheduled hygiene times that are established based upon the clinical team\u2019s recommendations, and that staff seek input from the clinical team if clients wish to shower at times outside of the established hygiene timeframes. Confidential interviews and a review of C1\u2019s clinical notes indicated that C1 would choose to not shower for multiple days and then demand soap when C1 decided to shower, which, at times, lead to staff enforcing the established schedule and C1 expressing discontent and accusations of rights violations. CCL also received the allegation that staff do not provide minor (C1) privacy when making personal calls. It was reported that C1 was unable to bypass the operator while attempting to contact CCL due to not having access to the physical phone during confidential calls and only being provided headphones. Confidential interviews indicated that facility policy requires staff to dial the phone for clients due to, upon placement, not being allowed by their parents to contact certain people. A review of the program statement and parent handbook indicated that this policy is not provided to clients prior to entering the program. Confidential interviews indicated that clients are provided privacy while using the headphones to speak on the phone. A confidential interview indicated that C1 was not comfortable contacting CCL due to staff knowing about C1 making a report. A conflicting confidential interview and review of an incident report indicated that C1 was vocal about reporting the facility staff as a result of the incidents described above and informed staff of their intention to report. CONTINUED...\n\n...CONTINUED Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegations that staff denied minors breakfast, staff denied minor a shower, and staff do not provide minor privacy when making personal calls are unsubstantiated. The allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

During the investigation, a review of pertinent records confirmed the incident that took place on August 5, 2024, in which C1 destroyed property, was a danger to themself, and walked out of the facility to hide on grounds. Confidential interviews revealed C1\u2019s behavior escalated, which prompted staff to assist in attempting to have C1 de-escalate by redirecting and talking to C1. Confidential interviews revealed that despite these attempts, C1 was unable to de-escalate and exited the facility, prompting staff to contact law enforcement. Confidential interviews and a review of records revealed staff followed C1 outside, and C1 hid in a bush until law enforcement responded. In response, C1 was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. A conflicting confidential interview revealed that staff did not respond in an appropriate manner and did not supervise C1 in a correct way allowing for C1 to obtain glass and exit the facility. A confidential interview, however, revealed the facility was not equipped to handle the level of intervention and supervision C1 required. Other confidential interviews revealed that the behaviors C1 experienced intensified throughout their stay in the facility, and a confidential interview revealed that C1 was admitted under a specific diagnosis that eventually was found not to be an accurate diagnosis for C1\u2019s condition. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegation staff did not provide adequate supervision to minor is unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On June 5, 2025, at 2:00 PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Abby Saeteurn met with Program Director Ellen Asquith to deliver a case management deficiencies report. According to a Special Incident Report (SIR) received by Community Care Licensing (CCL) on March 30, 2025, C1 was reported to have received the incorrect dose of a medication due to the facility\u2019s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) not being updated. Based on confidential interviews and records review, it was revealed that on March 29, 2025, S4 provided C1 with the incorrect dose of medication due to multiple electronic medical records being maintained. Confidential interviews revealed that on March 23, 2025, at 7:27 PM, C1 was prescribed two 50 mg capsules of a psychotropic medication by S5. Confidential interviews revealed that on March 28, 2025, at 3:08 PM, S1 made adjustments to C1\u2019s medications in an attempt to taper off C1 and lowered the dose to 1 capsule of 50 mg. At the time of the dosage adjustment, S1 did not discontinue the electronic medical record previously prescribed by S5, which led S4 to give C1 the incorrect dose on March 29, 2025. Confidential interviews revealed S2 was able to catch the discrepancy and notified S3 who ensured S1 removed the outdated electronic medical record on March 30, 2025, at 11:20 AM. Based on Interviews and record reviewed, the facility is being cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Section 84070 Children\u2019s Records (b)(16)(E) An exit interview was conducted with Program Director, Ellen Asquith.

It was also reported that the licensee contracts out for a cleaning service on the weekends, but it\u2019s not enough and the bathrooms don\u2019t get cleaned. It was alleged that the facility is not kept in clean, sanitary conditions for clients at all times. Consistent confidential interviews confirmed that the facility has an outside cleaning service that cleans the house two times a week. During the visit, LPA and LPM observed the cleaning service personnel present and cleaning the facility. The facility was observed to be clean and sanitary and confidential interviews did not corroborate that the facility is not kept clean. It was also alleged that staff do not ensure bathrooms are in good repair. Confidential interviews confirmed that one of the facility restrooms has been out of service for renovations for approximately two months. During the inspection, LPA and LPM observed that the bathroom was still out of service and that renovations were taking place during the visit. A confidential interview reported that one bathroom toilet was previously clogged, as a result of a client\u2019s diagnosis; however, the toilet was repaired the next day. During the visit, it was observed by LPA and LPM that the facility has four additional bathrooms, and the two bathrooms regularly used by clients were in good repair. Confidential interviews reported that there has not been a time when multiple restrooms were out of order. Based on confidential interviews and observations, the allegations that staff do not ensure facility is kept in clean, sanitary condition for youth at all times and staff do not ensure bathrooms are in good repair are unsubstantiated. The allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted with Maria Fernanda Herrera and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided. This is an amended version of the original report created on 07/10/2025.",

The incident of 4/11/22 where C1 engaged in an unsafe behavior needs further evaluation and LPA shall return to conclude the evaluation of this incident. LPA also requested case notes related to behaviors that lead to the decision to discharge C1 as Ms. Good states that there was more than the incident articulated in the 4/11/22 incident.

Staff then stepped away from youth again, knowing that C3 was not back to baseline and C3 punched the wall again, causing youth to fracture their hand and having to go to the emergency room for treatment.

LPA Hill also asked Ms. Bertolino to provide the proof of the Root Cause Analysis training for the three staff present related to the 2/25/23 incident as well.

Once S3 stepped out of the room, C2 then punched a wall inflicting injury to themselves. Ms. Bertolino states that there is one staff that has not completed their part of the documentation and that this will be provided upon completion as requested.

    "narrative": "Investigation showed that facility staff were aware that C1 and C2 were \"too friendly\" with one another and staff attempted to supervise the youth at all times but, given the staffing ratio of one staff to three clients, and the acuity of the youth in care, it was difficult at times to maintain supervision. Interviews with current and previous staff members indicated that C1 and C2 were \"overly friendly\" and \"sneaky\" in their relationship with one another, leading to a time when C1 and C2 left their respective rooms at least one time at night to \"meet up in the hallway\". Confidential interviews with staff failed to indicate any staff members being aware of any inappropriate touching or a romantic relationship between C1 and C2 and failing to intervene. LPA Hill was informed that there were some boundary violations between C2 and S1 in that S1 discussed their personal life with C2 and that C2 may have \"held that over [S1]\", indicating that C2 may have been granted privileges including not being supervised appropriately. LPA Hill found that no additional staff that could corroborate this allegation but another youth in care indicated that one of the youths would \"sneak into their room\" at night without staff knowing to \"make out\" with their roommate. LPA Hill attempted to reach out to C1 and C2 but neither youth would consent to an interview. Youths' respective parent/guardian relayed that, since their youth returned from care, they were concerned about the supervision of the youth in the facility due to this relationship developing and being allowed to \"blossom\", causing undue harm and further trauma since being in care. Regarding the allegation that staff sleep during their shift, confidential interviews revealed that there were numerous allegations made by youth about various staff but there was never any evidence to corroborate this allegation against any of the staff employed by the agency. Confidential interviews with staff indicate that Residential Supervisors and other staff did sporadic check-ins during the overnight shift to verify allegations as they surfaced but were unsuccessful. While the allegations continued to be made, investigation did not indicate a time when any staff were found to be asleep during that shift or any other shift despite the continued allegations. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, the allegations that staff are allowing minors to engage in inappropriate behavior(s) while in care, that staff do not provide adequate supervision to minors, and that staff sleep during shift(s) are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Exit interview was conducted to Ms. Saravia and documentation was provided.",

LPA Hill informed Ms. Good that the inspection today is to finalize an open case management inspection related to the 5/8/24 Case Management Inspection. The initial incident report dated 4/28/24 was related to an incident where in C1 (see LIC811 dated 6/21/24) felt uncomfortable with S1 being in the room with them during a doctor visit where C1 needed to change into an exam gown. LPA Hill conducted confidential interviews with C1 and S1 and did determine that while C1 felt uncomfortable about staff presence, there was no malicious intent on behalf of S1 by being in the room. S1 felt it prudent to be in the room with S1 as there were potentially dangerous items accessible to youth. S1 was formally counseled by the agency and has been trained that youth have rights to privacy during examinations and/or doctor visits and that unless youth explicitly request staff presence, staff cannot assume that they need to be present. This concludes the investigation into this incident. LPA Hill also informed Ms. Good that today's inspection is related to an incident report dated 6/10/24 indicating youth had joined a virtual meeting for their 12 Step Program via Zoom and, upon joining the meeting, realized it was compromised, exposing youth to inappropriate material. Ms. Good states that staff immediately shut down the meeting but not prior to youth seeing the inappropriate content. Due to this, the agency is making adjustments to their day to either ensure that there is adequate time to arrive at the physical meeting in time to attend or missing the meeting for the week. Ms. Good states that they will not be utilizing the platform of Zoom moving forward due to the apparent ability to hack this platform. No citations were issued and documentation was provided to Ms. Good. End of document.",

The first incident report dated 4/5/25 involved a disclosure made by C1 (see LIC811 dated 4/23/25) about being assaulted by a doctor. LPA Hill inquired about the incident and conducted interviews of staff. LPA Hill was informed no follow up occurred prior to C1's discharge on 4/9/25. No follow up is necessary at this time. The second incident report dated 4/8/25 involved an inappropriate sexual contact between C2 and C3 and was observed and reported by C4.LPA Hill learned that the agency conducted an internal investigationLPA Hill requested the agency provide the internal investigation. Additional follow up is necessary. Also discussed during the inspection was the closing of bedroom doors. LPA Hill advised that the closing of the doors when there are two clients in the room lends to issues of supervision, depending on the circumstances and specific incidents. LPA Hill advised that the clients do have a right to close the door but when there is more than one client in the room, closing the door could lend to supervision issues. Agency states that this was an issue with their Joint Commission. LPA Hill advised that this was not a fire inspection stipulation nor is this a licensing issue. LPA Hill did advise the agency that incident reports need to be timely in that the initial incident report should be provided within 24 hours and the follow up written reports need to be provided to the Department within the seven days as required by Title 22 Regulation.

LPA Hill informed NAME that the inspection is a follow up to an initial inspection conducted on 4/23/25, where it was discussed that C1 (see LIC811 dated 5/13/25) disclosed abuse to S1 on 4/5/25. In interviewing staff at the facility, it was discussed that while the disclosure was made to S1, direct care staff are not to question youth about the specifics when abuse is reported or disclosed, rather they are to provide the information for clinical staff to then have a meeting with youth to provide support for youth in a trauma informed manner and assist youth in processing the traumatic incident. LPA Hill was informed that the agency did not provide this follow up with C1 prior to C1 discharging from the facility. When asked why this was not done, it was noted that they did not have a valid reason. As a result of the agency not providing the follow up with C1 following the disclosure of a traumatic incident, the agency was cited for violation of Title 22 Regulation Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision as the agency did not provide the care necessary to assist a youth in dealing with the disclosure of the a traumatic event.

LPA was granted access to the facility by the Compliance Specialist (CS). On 8/2/22, the Department received information from the facility compliance manager, that the facility would need to address repairs to replace plumbing in the facility. The compliance manager further reported that the repairs would require all residents to be relocated to alternate site facilities while repair work was scheduled to be completed for approximately ten days. On 8/18/2022, during the time of inspection, LPA O'Connell toured the entire facility and inspected all bathrooms, bathtubs, toilets, and faucets to ensure that plumbing was in working condition. All faucets were measured and temperature was found to be within the required range (105 degrees to 120 degrees). The compliance specialist provided documentation reflecting repair work completed as well as attempts to address the matter at onset. Per Title 22, California Code of Regulations, there are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed with the Compliance Specialist and left at the facility.",

LPA conducted interviews with S1 at 9:25AM, S2 at 9:33AM, S3 at 9:40AM, S4 at 9:46AM, C1 at 9:55AM, and C2 at 10:01AM. All parties interviewed stated that AWOLs were not a common occurrence at this home. In interviews with S1 and S2, both staff stated they had never asked a client to remove their shoes to prevent AWOL, nor had they witnessed another staff requesting this from a client. In an interview with S3, S3 stated that when clients first come to the program, they are given sandals or slippers to prevent AWOLs in their first 72 hours. S4 reiterated this, saying that clients were asked to remove their shoes in their first 72 hours in the program. C1 stated that in their first 72 hours in the program they were asked to remove their shoes to prevent AWOL, and another client had given them slippers to wear. C2 stated they had never had their shoes taken away but had witnessed staff asking another client to remove their shoes to prevent AWOL. In a document titled \"Appendix B: 72-Hour Protocol\" sent to LPA Fremont on 08/14/2020 at 12:08PM, the following is stated: \"If clients are assessed upon admission as a high risk for elopement, they are to be given their sandals or clogs that they bring from home.\" It is also stated, \"These clients are provided their shoes for activities that require them such as equine or fitness.\" Upon review of C1 and C2's Needs and Services Plans from that time, neither C1 nor C2 had indications of AWOL behavior as a presenting problem or an ongoing behavioral issue. Based on the information gathered, including records review and interviews with staff and clients, there is a preponderance of evidence that clients were asked to remove their shoes to prevent elopement from the program. Therefore, the allegation \"Staff denied minor access to personal belongings\" is substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(6)(C) - Personal Rights. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. At this time, one deficiency is being cited. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided and discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Princess Garcia to be signed and returned no later than 5PM on Monday, 04/12/2021.",

Based on the evidence obtained while investigating the allegation(s) of, \u201cfacility does not have enough food\u201d and \u201cfacility does not have enough cleaning supplies\u201d, the findings are Unsubstantiated. The evidence for the allegation(s): \u201cfacility does not have enough food\u201d and \u201cfacility does not have enough cleaning supplies\u201d as follows; On April 20, 2020, LPA Raissi interviewed the Administrator (S1). During this interview, S1 explained to this LPA, that she is doing her best to find additional cleaning and food supplies. S1 reported that she started locking up some of the food and cleaning supplies to conserve, due to shortages in cleaning and food supplies because of COVID-19. Per S1, the Group Home is having difficulty like everyone else at this time; Due to COVID-19 stay at home orders, there was a lack of supplies at local grocery stores and supermarket chains during the month of April. S1 stated, I never received a message from the night shift staff, they are the ones who let me, or the House Manager (S3) know if we need more supplies. Per S1, there was a misunderstanding with the night shift staff. The night shift staff is supposed to tell management when they are running low on food and other supplies. (S1) and/or S3 were making deliveries to conserve supplies every two (2) days, as appose to before the supply shortage, management would make deliveries once (1) a week. The SJPD report, confirms that the Police Officer conducted a welfare check on April 16, 2020. The report indicates that there were food and cleaning supplies at the Group Home. On April 20, 2020, LPA Raissi toured the facility (via tele-visit) with the Administrator (S1). Based on observations conducted by this LPA; All food groups were incorporated. The facility had a sufficient amount of food and cleaning supplies; Therefore, the facility was not cited during the visit on April 20, 2020.\n\nBased on interviews with staff members (S2, S3, S4) and a Confidential Witness, all four (4) persons corroborated that there was a shortage of food and cleaning supplies during the month of April. The witnesses reported that subsequently after the police came, on April 16, 2020, S1 restock supplies back to normal levels. All four individuals indicated that the facility representatives rectified the situation by restocking supplies and that supplies are as they were before the COVID-19 food and supply shortage. The facility representatives had taken precautionary steps in order to conserve supplies due to the COVID- 19 stay at home orders. The supplies have been replenished to normal standards for the staff members at the Group Home. The welfare check conducted by the Police Officer reported that there were enough food and cleaning supplies at the Group Home. Therefore, the allegation, \u201cfacility does not have enough food\u201d and \u201cfacility does not have enough cleaning supplies\u201d is found to be Unsubstantiated. If any future incidences/information is provided to this Department regarding the lack of food and cleaning supplies, the complaint will be re-opened and further investigated. Based on LPA Raissi\u2019s observations, documents reviewed, and interviews that were conducted the allegation(s) of, \u201cfacility does not have enough food\u201d and \u201cfacility does not have enough cleaning supplies\u201d, is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. LIC 811 Confidential Names Form, dated September 21, 2020, was given to the Administrator. California Code Regulations, Title 22 Division 6 regulations are NOT being cited. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of the report was sent to the Administrator, Manjinder Nijjar.",

    "narrative": "However, there were conflicting statements regarding when C1 acquired the alcohol, some interviews suggested that C1 had hid the alcohol behind the Chevron gas station dumpster during a previous unauthorized absence on December 12, 2024. Another confidential interview reported that C1 stole the alcohol from the Chevron gas station on the day of the incident, December 15, 2024. Despite the allegations of lack of supervision, statements obtained by the Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) denied this claim. Multiple confidential interviews reported that, due to C1's history of elopements and unsafe behavior, safety precautions were in place, including increased supervision for C1. Additionally, it was noted that staff conducted regular room checks and did not permit clients to consume alcohol or leave the facility unattended. Witness statements also affirmed that staff adhered to the group home's emergency protocols to intervene and respond to situations safely. Furthermore, there were no disclosures that staff provided access to alcohol, tobacco, or other contraband items to the clients in care. Based on confidential interviews and records review, the allegation due to a lack of supervision, staff did not prevent a minor(C1) from having access to alcohol while in care is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted.

Further, confidential interviews consistently denied that staff provide C1 or any other clients in care with drugs, alcohol, or tobacco products. It was also reported that Oak Grove staff are aware that clients and day program students often find ways to obtain and sneak contraband onto the facility grounds. Nevertheless, staff are diligent in confiscating and destroying any items that are found.

    "narrative": "While it was confirmed that S1's employment at the group home coincided with C1's time in care, confidential interviews indicated that S1's interactions with C1 were minimal and always occurred in the presence of other group home staff. This is further supported by documented accounts of C1's history of inappropriate behaviors, which included poor boundaries with different clients and making sexual comments. Due to these behaviors, confidential interviews reported that C1 required increased supervision and was never left alone with staff or clients. Additionally, Investigator Gonzales obtained relevant documents that revealed inconsistencies in the disclosures regarding the alleged sexual abuse. Furthermore, Investigator Gonzales did not receive any evidence or witness statements indicating that S1 and C1 were never alone together. The Department received an allegation that staff member (S1) physically abused a minor (C1), who was in their care. Most confidential interviews consistently denied witnessing any physical abuse or mistreatment of C1 by S1 or other facility staff. A confidential witness reported seeing S1 being aggressive with C1 during a restraint. This witness was unable to provide the date of the alleged incident. LPA obtained the Special Incident Report submitted to the Department, which indicated that on September 21, 2024, S1 and other group home staff were involved in a restraint involving C1. Upon reviewing the incident report, no licensing violations were noted, and the report did not indicate any staff misconduct. In addition, while in care, C1 was not observed to have any visible marks or bruises indicating physical abuse, and there were no disclosures from C1 suggesting that S1 physically abused or had any inappropriate interactions with C1. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegations that staff (S1) sexually abused minor (C1) in care and staff (S1) physically abused minor (C1) in care are unsubstantiated.

Additionally, another client was unable to recall if anything consensual, or otherwise, occurred between C1 and C2. Further, the incident report and confidential interviews reported that group home staff acted accordingly and followed C1 and C2 while they were off grounds, until both clients were out of sight, indicating efforts were made to maintain supervision. The Department received an allegation that staff were not dispensing medication as prescribed. However, confidential interviews and a review of the facility's policy indicated that, for safety reasons, medications may be withheld for up to 24 hours based on medical or clinical direction. This can occur when there is concern that a client may have used substances, either on or off grounds, without staff supervision, which could lead to an adverse reaction to their prescribed medications. Additionally, clients have the right to refuse medication, and facility staff are required to document any refusals or missed medications in the client\u2019s medication records, as mandated by policy.

Specifically, it was reported S1 allowed C1 to leave the facility to meet with A1 who was known to participate in CSEC activities. Confidential interviews provided conflicting statements regarding the allegations. Confidential interviews reported that residents would often leave the facility without permission (AWOLing) and return to the facility prior to resident being considered AWOL according to facilities AWOL protocol of two hours which is when authorities would be notified. Confidential interviews reported staff would attempt to discourage this behavior by reminding residents of consequences of leaving without permission and the safety concerns staff had for the residents. Conflicting confidential interviews reported S1 allowed C1 to leave with A1 as long as C1 brought S1 food when C1 returned without considering C1 AWOL. Confidential interviews and record review could not confirm or dispute these allegations. Community Care Licensing (CCL) received an additional allegation alleging Staff (Staff #1 [S1]) assisted minors (Child #1 [C1] and other youth [youth\u2019s names unknown]) with purchasing illegal substances. Specifically, it was reported S1 had taken C1 and other youth at the facility to purchase illegal drugs and alcohol. Confidential interviews reported conflicting statements regarding the allegation. Confidential interviews and record review revealed S1 had been disciplined for taking residents on unapproved outings. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute these outings were to purchase illegal drugs and alcohol. Based on record review and confidential interviews the allegations alleging Staff (Staff #1 [S1]) did not prevent minor (Child #1 [C1]) from engaging in Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) activity, Staff (S1) allowed minor (C1) to visit with unauthorized adult (Adult #1 [A1]), and Staff (S1) assisted minors (C1 and other youth [youth\u2019s names unknown]) with purchasing illegal substances, may or may not have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by the evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report was provided along with appeal rights to Our House Administrator, Devin Baze.",

On July 27, 2022, at 4:00PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Val Wilson, initiated an unannounced visit with Shelter Manger, Joe Mendoza Jr. The purpose of the case management was to discuss information the Department received in a Law Enforcement Contact Report date July 7, 2022, regarding Client 1 (C1), Client 2 (C2) and Client 3 (C3) returning to the facility with law enforcement at 3:00AM after being away from the facility for an undetermined amount of time, using the facilities keys to steal the facility van without staff knowledge.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the following issues and concerns with the Licensee for both Our House and My Place facilities: Administrator qualifications and duties, lack of administrative oversight, staff training, plan of correction, lack of trauma informed care, personal rights, and lack of supervision concerning the Our House facility. The three areas of concern applicable to the My Place facility are lack of administrative oversight, Administrator qualifications and duties and Plan of correction. Administrator qualifications and duties - LPM Smith advised there are concerns regarding the Administrator\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding specific incidents that have occur in the facility, lack of knowledge of the clients in care and the needs and services of the clients in care, and Administrator referring (Continued on page 2)\n\nPg 2 (Continued from page 1) Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives to the Facility Manager, Joe Mendoza for information. The concerns cover the period of February 2022, when the Administrator of Our House was Darryl Evey until present. CEO stated that they are in the process of having facility administrators present at the facilities for 40 hours per week. They are also in the process of hiring a Director that will be overseeing the Administrators. Lack of oversight- LPM Smith advised there are concerns that the Administrator is not familiar with the regulations and there is a breakdown in communication amongst the staff. RM Cook stated there should be oversight by the Administrator and Board of Directors for all facility operations. CEO stated reports are emailed to CEO and he works on the outcome. Each month there is a board meeting and they go over special incident reports and Licensing reports. They also have a leadership meeting each week to go over pending issues. SBCCFS PRD Tracy Raymond shared improvements observed with Our House since the implementation of new youth and shelter protocols that San Bernardino county provides assist with, including CFTMs being initiated immediately, internal meetings every other week with FAP. The addition of Social Worker Julie Ann who comes from a trauma informed focus has been a strong positive influence over the last year. There are also supportive actions like peer advocates meeting with the youth to assist youth to adjust to being in a shelter. Tracy reported that Our House accepts placement for a broad spectrum of youth that are difficult to place and STRTP\u2019s are no longer willing to work with. If FAP calls the county emergency hotline, San Bernardino county representatives report to the facility and remove youth as necessary from placement to assist with de-escalation of emergency situations and crisis intervention. Tracy stated San Bernardino county is improving their practice and are helping FAP improve in their operations, working together as a partnership. Staff training- RM Cook advised there are concerns regarding a lack of staff training being reported from information gathered during complaint investigations and the annual inspections. CEO stated they began documenting the ongoing training a year ago when CCL brought this to their attention. Staff training is done every other Thursday, debriefing is done during staff meetings, along with scheduling staff, and outside agency training is provided. The process to onboard is four months and staff turnover averages at four months, leaving continued staffing issues as a primary struggle. As an incentive, the benefit of a half-paid day off has been implemented and additionally there are more outdoor activities which help the staff\u2019s mental health. (Continued to page 3)\n\nPg 3 (Continued from page 2) Representative from the Catalyst Center, Misty Berard shared they are available for support and shared the following links: mberard@catalyst-center.org; kmartinez@catalyst-center.org; https://catalyst-center.teachable.com/courses; https://catalystcenter.learnupon.com/store Plan of correction (POC)- LPM Smith advised that Joe from Our House and Fatima of My Place submit plan of corrections in a timely manner. There are concerns with the plan of correction from Nike of My Place and Devin of Our House not being submitted on time and verbally stating the plan of correction will be late. LPA Valerie Wilson has reminded them that the request for an extension for the plan of correction needs to be submitted and approved by CCL prior to the due date. LPM Smith advised if plan of correction is not received by the due date and there has not been an extension approved by CCL for the plan of correction due date the facility can be assessed civil penalties. CEO stated that Fatima's Administrator qualifications were turned in to CCL for My Place. Fatima will ensure that the plan of corrections are done properly. The current Administrator for Our House, Devin, will be separating employment from Our House at the end of the month and a new Administrator will be hired at Our House. The Board has done some interviews to fill the Administrator position. CEO complained that previous administrator packets took longs periods of time to approve and possibly Joe Mendoza can be designated during CCL's review of the administrator packet. RM Cook stated that the turnaround time for administrator qualifications review should be less than two weeks if the statement of qualification, and the correct documents are all provided in a timely manner to the LPA, and the candidate meets regulation requirements. If additional information is needed from the facility the turnaround time may be longer. Lack of trauma informed care- RM Cook advised that there have been substantiated complaints and case managements involving violations of personal rights that imply a lack of trauma informed care being provided by the facility staff. CEO stated their staff receive a lot of harm reduction and trauma informed care trainings. SOC Alicia Bernstein provided an overview of trauma informed care and provide resources. Child Trafficking Research and Policy Unit Analyst Leland Turner discussed harm reduction and provided resources and links for support. leeland.turner@dss.ca.gov , (Continued to page 4)\n\nPg 4 (Continued from page 3) https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/ACIN/2019/I-28_19.pdf?ver=2019-07-23-145815-020, ACIN I-28-19 (July 22, 2019) Harm Reduction Series - Social Worker, ACIN I-50-19 (July 29, 2019) Harm Reduction Series - Probation Officer, ACIN I-36-21 (June 22, 2021) Harm Reduction Series \u2013 Law Enforcement, ACIN I- 31-22 (April 8, 2022), Harm Reduction Series \u2013 Caregiver and ACIN I-59-18 (September 14, 2018) Introduction to the Harm Reduction Strategies Series Regarding Commercially Sexually Exploited Children. Personal rights and Lack of supervision\u2013 LPM Smith discussed several substantiated complaints regarding personal rights and lack of supervision from 2022 to present. LPM Smith summarized deficiencies cited. LPM Smith informed the Licensee of the Technical Support Program (TSP), stating it is a branch that can work with FAP in various areas they may need support in regarding facility operations. A referral can be made but it is voluntary. CEO stated their intention was never to work with foster youth, but there was a need and CFS asked the facility for support. CEO stated foster youth are much more difficult than the runaways and respond differently to the support, and support with crisis intervention would be appreciated. LPM Smith advised FAP to identify any areas they may need support to CCL and CCL will submit a TSP referral. Tracy Raymond stated the harm reduction training and resources provided by the Child Trafficking Research and Policy Unit is super informative for harm reduction and collaboration. Tracy also stated that San Bernardino county understands the responsibility they have in this situation and will continue to partner with the facility to help with compliance issues. CEO stated that he was not in agreement with CCL findings. RM Cook advised that FAP has the right to appeal and there are times the appeal is heard and findings are overturned. SBCCFS Deputy Director Nancy Satterwhite stated the county has looked at ways to collaborate and how to \"team\" placement combinations for youth in care. Peer family advocates are connected with the youth and it has been beneficial. San Bernardino county will also be hosting a mandated reporter training at Our House and looking at the contracts with the County for extra supports services that can be implemented. The CEO reported feeling better about the interaction with DCFS and how they are removing the clients to help the Program succeed along with the new contract that includes a new crisis intervention protocol. RM Cook reminded that regulatory enforcement and compliance is provided to protect the health and safety of youth in care and CCL hopes that the Licensee will take advantage of the assistance, collaboration, and all resources offered and provided by CCL and each department represented in the meeting. (Continued to page 5)\n\nPg 5 (Continued from page 4) The licensee is being requested to submit a Plan of Action for each of the focus areas above including the following: - How will the Board of Directors ensure appropriate administrative oversight is implemented? - Submit an updated LIC 500 for the hours that will be worked by the Administrator and facility staff -How will the Board review complaints, what information will be included in board meeting minutes, and how will the Board address issue client health and safety issues as they arise? - How will the facility ensure staff training is completed. - How will the facility ensure staff have knowledge of the program statement? - How will the facility ensure staff know how to implement appropriate crisis intervention? - How will the facility ensure the plan of corrections are completed and submitted to CCL by the due date? - How will the facility ensure trauma informed care is being provided? - How will the facility ensure the personal rights of clients are not being violated by staff? - How will the facility ensure that staff are adequately supervising the clients? The Plan of Action response will be submitted to CCL by August 29, 2023. If more time is needed to submit the plan of action or there are any questions, please contact LPA Valerie Wilson at valerie.wilson@dss.ca.gov or (951) 897-9155.

Regarding the allegation that S2 has engaged in an inappropriate relationship with C1, confidential interviews confirmed S2 brought C1 to their residence for a home cooked meal but documented a mall trip in the client file. Confidential interviews revealed that S2 never took C1 to the mall. Confidential interviews and documents reveal the community outing was approved for the mall and GH policy does not permit taking clients to an employee residence. Confidential interviews also revealed that S2 would only engage with the male clients, had danced in front male clients, and showed preferential treatment to C1. Regarding the allegation that S2 has spoken inappropriately to C1, confidential interviews confirmed S2 showed C1 favoritism and would call C1 handsome, cute or pretty eyes. Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegation that S2 has engaged in an inappropriate relationship with C1 and S2 has spoken inappropriately to C1 is supported and proven by evidence, therefore the allegations are substantiated at this time.

LPA met with Program Manager Yazeed Hamami and informed of the purpose of visit. Based on confidential observations, interviews, and record review, the authorized representative of a former client received a discharge notice after insurance denial and the representative confirming inability to pay. During the client's stay, their behavior escalated to the level of causing a safety risk, with behaviors including repeated verbally assaultive behaviors and verbal threats of violence against another client in care. The authorized representative was requested to pick up the client 3 days earlier due to this risk and refused. Child Protective Services were called and informed the facility the matter would warrant a call to the local police for child abandonment if the authorized representative did not show. The representative did ultimately pick up the client. Discharge paperwork was provided to representative at discharge, but representative reportedly did not wish to discuss the discharge. A discharge summary was mailed to representative.",

The facility has three shared client bedrooms with each room having two beds and containing the required bedding and furniture observed to be in good repair; sufficient storage/drawer space for clients' personal belongings was also observed. There is one common or shared full bathroom at the end of the hallway off of which all of the bedrooms are situated. There is an additional en suite full bathroom in one of the client bedrooms. All the bathrooms were in good repair, with toilets that flushed and fixtures that provided hot water that was within the required temperature range. There are multiple refrigerators and/or freezer units all observed to be in good working condition and provided temperatures within the required range for perishable items. There is also sufficient storage space for dried good or non-perishable items. Also observed within a secured staff office adjacent to the living room or common area were lockable cabinets for confidential files and medications. Potentially hazardous cleaning agents and chemicals were stored appropriately in a secured cabinet. The thermostat read a temperature that was within the required range. A fully stocked first aid kit was observed to be on the premises. There is a laundry area secured but accessible to clients as appropriate. There is a posting of the Foster Youth Bill of Rights at a conspicuous location. The backyard was found to not have any potentially hazardous areas or items; the pathways are unobstructed. There is an area of the fence that runs along the west side of the property close to the entrance and along the driveway that leads to the back of the premises that is in disrepair. The section is unstable, may fall over, and/or presents a potential safety hazard to clients in care--as a condition of licensure, this is to be repaired so that it is secured to the ground or the base of the fencing. A subsequent onsite inspection may be required to evaluate compliance. A copy of this report is being provided to Ms. Kuhn.",

This case management is being conducted based on communication between LPA Belfield, LPA Flynn and Administrator Nikkia Rojas. On 9/25/2020, LPAs Belfield and Flynn contacted Administrator Rojas and requested the Needs and Service Plans for the clients and case notes from Mr. Corey Young, the facility social worker. Follow up calls and emails were completed on 9/28/2020, 9/29/2020, and 10/8/2020 with Administrator Rojas to request the case notes by Mr. Young as previous information submitted was incomplete. It was stated by Administrator Rojas on 10/8/2020 that she would submit the case notes on 10/16/2020. Based on further communication with Administrator Rojas on 10/22/2020 and 10/26/2020, it was explained to Administrator Rojas by LPA Belfield that the requested documents were not received, and LPA Belfield had not been receiving responses to the communication being sent. Follow up communication from Administrator Rojas was sent on 11/2/2020 to LPA Belfield that stated she had not had any communication with Mr. Young in order to obtain his information regarding the clients. On 11/2/2020, LPA Belfield sent an email to Administrator Rojas asking about the status of the request for documentation as LPA Belfield had not received a response. LPA Belfield also gave Administrator Rojas until 11/9/2020 to submit the requested documents. In response, Administrator Rojas stated that she had not been able to contact Mr. Young to obtain any of his notes.\n\nAdministrator Rojas has informed LPA Belfield that Mr. Young is not in contact with Pennacle and has not provided his documentation to them. This documentation includes his case notes. Administrator Rojas acknowledged that Mr. Young was not meeting with clients regularly, nor in person due to COVID-19. Additionally, a client who had been in placement at the facility informed LPA Belfield that he had not met and did not know who Mr. Young was.

Section 80070(a), of the Title 22, California Code of Regulations, requires that client files are maintained with a complete record. Due to Mr. Young\u2019s failure to provide social work case notes and the facility\u2019s inability to obtain them from January 2020 through October 2020, the client files are incomplete. Section 80022(k), of Title 22, of the California Code of Regulations, requires a facility to operate in accordance with their plan of operation. Administrator Rojas acknowledges that their social worker was not providing one on one services to the clients as specified on the LIC 9106, dated 3/2/2020 within the program statement.

One was in the side yard by the side bushes, and one was on the driveway. During visit, LPA toured the facility grounds with Interim Administrator and Training Administrator. During the search, two more cigarette butts were found, for a total of four cigarette butts. Interim Administrator stated a search was done at the facility the previous evening, so these must have been between then and 10AM. All cigarette butts were removed immediately. Cigarette butts were observed at previous visits on 2/16/22 and 4/13/22, and citations were issued. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84087 Buildings and Grounds as well as an immediate civil penalty for repeat violation of $250.

LPA met with Interim Administrator Rizza Madlangbayan and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation at the facility, LPA conducted a record review and observed that the needs and services for a resident (see LIC 811) were not being updated every 6 months, and current plans were not maintained in the resident's file. On 8/4/22, LPA observed that the needs and services plan dated 11/21/20 in the file is blank and directs reader to refer to the Individualized Program Plan (IPP). LPA located the Regional Center of the East Bay IPP, dated 1/2/20, and Interim Administrator stated this is the most current record. However, the previous Interim Administrator provided LPA with two plans, one a behavior report dated 2/1/22 and signed by the behaviorists and one an Individualized Service Plan (ISP) dated 1/12/22 and signed by only the previous Interim Administrator. The file did not contain, and thus, does not reflect that care plans are being updated every 6 months. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Section 84068.3(a) and Section 84070(c). See attached LIC 809-Ds. Additionally, during visit LPA reviewed the medication records for the same resident and observed that psychotropic medications are not being documented on a separate log, including clonidine, divaloroex sodium, clobazam, lamotrigine, lorazepam (PRN), and sertraline. LPA previously advised the facility of this requirement on 8/19/21 and provided the correct form to use on 8/20/21. The current log also does not contain the prescription date nor the number of refills. LPA is issuing a citation of CCR, Title 22, Section 84070(b). See attached LIC 809-Ds. Lastly, a nursing assessment in the same resident's file, dated 2/10/22, indicated that the resident is bedridden, but the physician's report and capability assessment indicate the resident is nonambulatory. Interim Administrator stated that this resident is not bedridden and can transport self to a chair.\n\nRecords also show resident can walk with assistance. LPA advises, per CCR, Title 22, Section 80010, that the facility must operate in accordance with their license, which permits ambulatory and up to two nonambulatory residents but bedridden residents are not permitted. See attached LIC 9102.

LPA met with Interim Administrator Rizza Madlangbayan and informed of the purpose of the visit. The CARE Inspection Tool was used to conduct this inspection. The facility is clean, and kitchen and bathroom spaces are sanitary. Outdoor activity space is free of hazards, and all emergency exits are unobstructed. First aid kit was observed to be complete. The facility is maintained at a comfortable temperature within permitted range. Hot water was below range. See below. Kitchen was stocked with quality food within date and in enough quantity to meet the needs of residents in care. Medication records are complete and match prescriptions and medication counts. License, residents' personal rights, and an emergency and disaster plan are posted in the facility. During inspection, LPA observed that hot water measured 103.1 F at all sinks (both bathrooms and the kitchen), below the lower end of the permitted range of 105 F. LPA reviewed the hot water daily log going back to June and observed that hot water fluctuates to within and just below required range. LPA is issuing an advisory per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80088 Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment, and Supplies. See LIC 9102. A continuation visit will be conducted to complete the review of personnel records. No additional deficiencies were found and no citations are being issued today.

Per interviews, due to anticipating the hours would be cut, despite the hours still being in effect, no additional nurse staff was hired or sought. The resident at the sister facility was not being switched to the nasal medication due to the physician determining that this resident would need to remain on the rectal medication, and so their nursing hours were not anticipated to be cut. During record review, LPA nor Interim Administrator were able to locate documentation of the nursing hours currently in effect, and the care plans do not clearly state the specifics of the nursing hours that were in effect. As such, this aspect of the care and treatment services to be provided to both residents cannot be verified, and it cannot be confirmed that the facility is following the care plans as agreed upon by the care teams. Additionally, based on interviews, it was known to the facility that the nursing hours were still in effect for the resident formerly in placement at this facility and that this was still an agreed upon service to be provided to this resident. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated.

Additionally, when LPA requested the activity calendar, staff informed LPA that there was no current activity calendar and no planned activities. One resident was not taken to school due to another resident having a behavior and staff feeling it would not be an efficient use of time to transport the resident since they would get out of school soon. LPA is issuing a citation of California CCR, Title 22, Section 84079 Planned Activities. Lastly, at least one resident has aged out of the children's residential age range.

    "narrative": "However, this is why calling 911 immediately to seek timely medical attention is important. The facility has a history of admitting residents with seizures, so all staff should be trained on seizures. It was also learned that this resident had a seizure in 2019 which was not reported to the licensing agency or to the authorized representative. During a file review conducted today, LPA observed that there was no incident report for this in the file, despite the file containing reports from 2019. Additionally, based on observation and interview, staff were not aware of the activity calendar and confirmed it had not been implemented, including not doing holiday crafts on a holiday as written on the calendar due to there being no crafts provided and not knowing crafts to be planned. LPA observed in the month of December that the activity plan for October was still posted, and staff were unfamiliar with the November plan. Training on facility activities is required, as the activities being planned is meant to ensure residents are able to engage in enjoyable and skill-building activities, which will also enable staff to monitor resident behaviors and assess whether residents are meeting behavior goals laid out in the needs and services (behavior) plans. Further, during today's visit, LPA observed that the behavior tracker for a resident for whom the behavior plan requires staff to track behaviors had 9 missing full days and an additional 22 missing shifts. Lastly, on 8/4/22, a few days prior to receipt of the complaint, alleging resident records were not maintained at the facility, LPA observed the needs and services plans to not be updated and/or current plans not maintained in the file. A citation was issued. During today's visit, LPA inspected residents records and observed that all four files were missing the current needs and services (behavior report) plans prepared on a quarterly basis by the behaviorist, supplied to LPA by behaviorist and dated October to November 2022. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. LPA is issuing 6 citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84072 Personal Rights, Section 80065 Personnel Requirements, Section 80061 Reporting Requirements, Section 84079 Planned Activities, and Section 84070 Client Records.

Based on confidential interviews and record review, more than one staff reported seeing staff be aggressive toward residents, including pushing a resident on their bed, throwing a pillow at a resident's face, and yelling at residents to stop behaviors using a threatening or inappropriate tone. No injuries to the residents were observed, the facility reported the incidents appropriately, and none of the staff seen being aggressive, who had all been put on immediate suspensions, still work at the facility. Reports indicate no recent observations of staff aggression toward residents. Based on confidential interviews and record review, staff observed a resident laying down and shaking and called the administrator to confirm the observation before calling 911.

Based on interviews, though, there have been multiple occasions where the de-escalation plan could not be followed because there were not enough staff for a restraint.

On 5/26/23, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a case management visit. LPA met with Administrator Jose Guzman and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation at the facility, it was learned that, based confidential interviews, record review, and observation, two staff from one of licensee's other facilities who did not have necessary training to provide care and supervision to the residents of this facility were called to cover a night shift. The initial staff member was called by management staff, who was the on-call worker, and who did not answer later calls from the staff when they called for guidance and assistance during an escalated resident incident. The staff were unfamiliar with the facility, the residents, their needs, care plans, specific intervention protocols, and medication procedures, and were unable to access facility records, including medication records, due to not being able to locate the key to the locked storage.

LE stated C1 denied anyone hurting him or holding him down or scratching his arm and he didn\u2019t find anything suspicious. AD stated she sent C1\u2019s last incident on 10/22/20 to CPS. On this date LPA interviewed three clients. The clients did not provide any specific details about C1 being restrained or injured. Also, on this date LPA interviewed three staff. Staff S1 stated, \u201cC1 goes to visit his parents every Monday and he\u2019s very honest about his visits \u2026 he said his mom doesn\u2019t have any money and she wasn\u2019t going to their visit\u2026\u201d Staff S2 stated that C1 has not been in any restraints in the last 2 months. Staff S3 stated C1 has never had a restraint in the last three months since they started working at this facility. On 12/28/20 LPA interviewed client C1 and his Biological Father (BF). LPA asked C1 what happened when the administrator (AD) at People\u2019s Care restrained you. C1 stated, \u201cThey restrained me.\u201d When LPA asked for more details C1 was not able to give LPA specific details or a timeline. C1\u2019s speech was difficult to understand so LPA asked BF to interpret C1\u2019s speech. BF stated C1 was bruised from a big guy sitting on him and when AD was grabbing him by the arm and dragged him into the house and he was leaning against the bed that was when the big guy sat on him.\u201d Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. No title 22 regulations were cited during today\u2019s inspection. LPA provided the Summary Report to Pauletta Hendrix, Administrator upon completion by email with a request for signature and to scan this back to the LPA with their signature on this date.",

No other children were present in the area, and a direct-care staff witnessed the interaction and put a stop to it, immediately, by sending the clients to each of their rooms. There was no prior behavior exhibited by the children for the facility to have reasonably anticipated this incident; and no subsequent incident has taken place since. The children interviewed corroborated in describing the level of care and supervision they receive in the facility as more than sufficient. The assigned probation officer reported no concerns regarding the facility's ability to care for and properly supervise children.

LPAs reviewed nine staff files, one Administrator file, and four client files. LPAs also interviewed two clients. The other two clients were not able to communicate effectively to be interviewed. All client and staff files were accessible to LPAs. Board Meeting minutes were not provided, which were originally requested on 6/28/2022. Psychotropic medications were not separated on separate forms as required, and there were no psychotropic medication authorized representative consents for any of the minor clients. LPA reviewed the CCL Psychotropic Medication Administration Record with Administrator and offered it as an option for them to use, or they can ensure the pharmacy is informed of the changes they need to make to be in compliance. LPA found no evidence of clients having been to a dentist or a doctor as required for general check ups, although Administrator explained the clients' parents do take them, they just have not sent in any of the paperwork. There were also no records of TB tests for three out of four clients. LPA found that clients are not receiving allowances as required. This issue was brought up and cited at two other People's Care Homes - Shawmutt and Pleides previously. A POC was submitted by the Director of Quality Assurance and Development (DQAD) on 1/24/2022 which detailed how the facility would ensure clients received a certain amount of money each week. DQAD submitted that correction for this house, Kenneth, as well. The facility is not following this plan. LPA has advised the Administrator that this is a requirement for all of People's Care licensed children's residential facilities and advised upper management to correct this in all of their homes state-wide to prevent future citations.\n\nThe facility had a staff schedule as required, and had scheduled facility managers as required. Even though facility managers have received the required one hour training, there was no documented evidence of this. There were various other things missing or incorrect, which LPA detailed in the attached Technical Violation Advisory Notes, which are not citations.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced inspection on 3/16/23 at TIME for the purposes of conducting a case management inspection. At the time of LPA's arrival, staff Arizona Miller, Direct Support Staff was present and assisted with the inspection. LPA Hill informed Mr. Miller that the purpose of the inspection is to address concerns from the 2/16/23 inspection related to the 2/14/23 incident sent to Licensing detailing that C1 and C2 (see LIC811 dated 3/16/23) were unsupervised in C2's bedroom together resulting in C1 inappropriately touching C2. LPA Hill informed NAME that the incident has been investigated and the conclusion of that investigation shows that the facility did not have the proper supervision necessary to meet the needs of C1 and C2 in that C1 is to be staffed on a 1:1 and the facility did not staff to that need. At the time of the incident, the facility only had one staff present and working. S1 had gone over to the medication cabinet to get medications ready for administration, making it impossible to provide the supervision to C1 and C2 while completing this task. Following this incident, C1 left the facility and S1 could not follow as a result of being the only staff in the facility. As a result of both of these issues, the facility was cited for California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Regulation 84078(b) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. The facility failed to provide those services identified in each child's needs and services plan (Individualized Program Plan)...as necessary to meet the child's needs. Also discussed during the inspection was that the facility has not complied with the citation issued on 3/2/23 resulting from a complaint investigation. The plan of correction agreed upon on 3/2/23 indicates that the facility was to provide a weekly schedule to Licensing for the next 60 days indicating all the staff to be present at the facility on a weekly basis. The administrator has only provided LPA Hill with their own work schedule since this inspection. As a result, the facility was re-cited for California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Regulation 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and Regulation 84072(d) Personal Rights and given new due dates of 3/20/23 in which the facility shall provide weekly schedules to LPAs Hill and Roberts as requested.\n\nLPA Hill also discussed with Mr. Miller two of the citations issued during the annual inspections on 3/13/23 and 3/14/23, were either duplicative in nature or not applicable to this facility. LPA Hill explained that for one of the citations, while the citation number is not duplicated, the regulations themselves relate to the same issue and the intent is the same. Another one of the citations is related to a facility that is licensed for six or more clients and this facility is only licensed for four. As such, two of the LIC809Ds issued on 3/13/23 were amended to remove these citations. LPA Hill provided the facility with the updated documents to remove the discussed citations. Lastly, LPA Hill informed Mr. Miller that the case management inspection is being conducted today for the purposes of assessing civil penalties for three citations issued during the annual inspection on 3/13/23 and 3/14/23. The three identified repeat violations are 84070(b)(12) Children's Records as this citation is related to the facility not obtaining written authorization for psychotropic medication being administered to C1 and C2; 84070(b)(13) Children's Records as this citation is related to psychotropic medications needing a separate psychotropic medication administration record for each psychotropic medication prescribed to C1 and C2; and 84077(a)(2) Personal Services as the facility was not providing allowances to the clients in care. All of these repeat violations were previously cited on 7/6/22 during the annual inspection. LPA Hill informed NAME that the repeat violations assess are $250 per violation for the first day, and then $100 per violation, each day until the violation is corrected per Provider Information Notice 17-02-CCLD. LPA Hill observed that staff at the facility staff was preparing the Psychotropic Medication Administration Records (PMARs) for C1 and C2 on 3/14/23. As such, this civil penalty for 84070(b)(13) is assess for one day only, 3/13/23. The other two civil penalties will continue until the facility provides proof of correction as prescribed in the annual visitation reports for 3/13/23 and/or 3/14/23. When LPA Hill arrived at the facility on 3/16/23, it was observed that two staff were present but LPA Hill observed that S2 was sleeping in the living room area of the facility. LPA Hill contacted the Regional Director Abe Avila to inform him of what was found upon arrival at the facility. LPA also informed Mr. Avila that the facility will be cited for 84065.2(b)(1) Personnel Duties as the staff at the facility are required to perform duties including the supervision, protection and care of children individually and in groups at all times. LPA Hill informed Mr. Avila that this is not happening when staff are asleep while clients are present. Exit interview was conducted with Mr. Miller and Mr. Avila and documents were provided to the facility along with the appeal rights.",

    "narrative": "The allegation that the facility is not properly maintaining a record of C1's medications and medication orders, LPA Hill reviewed the medication binder at the facility containing the Centrally Stored Medication Log, Medication Administration Records (MAR) and prescriptions at the facility. LPA Hill discussed with Mr. Avila that the records do not include physician's orders for the medications as required. LPA Hill also discussed that the prescription numbers are not consistent with the MAR and the facility is not utilizing the required Psychotropic Medication Administration Record (PMAR) as required. LPA Hill informed Mr. Avila that the records have to also show when a prescription begins and when another ends. At this time, the way that the facility is documenting the administration of the medications is not clear about this. The allegation that a lack of supervision causes threat to a child in care is related to an incident that happened on 2/14/23 in which C1 may have touched C2 inappropriately in C2's bedroom. During this incident, investigation shows that the facility had only one staff working despite knowing and understanding that C1 is required to have a 1:1 staff person. The facility did not provide the 1:1 supervision necessary for C1 resulting in the inappropriate interaction. The 1:1 is clearly documented in the client's Individual Program Plan (IPP) maintained by Alta California Regional Center and all staff clearly understand the required supervision needs and reasons. As a result of the confidential interviews, investigation conducted and documentation received, the allegations that a child was left unsupervised, the facility is not properly maintaining medication administration records and that a lack of supervision causes threat to a child in care are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. Facility was cited for California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Regulation 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision.

LPA Hill interviewed staff, C1's (see LIC811 dated 3/2/23) regional center representative, biological mother to C1, and reviewed C1's documentation at the facility. Regarding the allegation that child was left unsupervised at the facility, Licensing received an incident report dated 2/2/23 detailing that C1's mother reached out to a facility representative about C1 being at the facility alone and without staff.

LPA observed that one staff, Arizona Miller, was leaving the premises as LPA Hill arrived as the staff and a client were going on a walk. LPA Hill spoke with the appointed administrator, Erinique Jones, via phone who stated that she was home sick today and unable to respond to the facility. LPA Hill informed Ms. Jones that the department is in receipt of the documentation provided for the administrator position and need additional documentation, including an LIC500 indicating the days and times that Ms. Jones would be physically present in the facility along with documentation that was submitted for the renewal of the group home administrator certificate as the current certificate expired 3/30/23. LPA Hill also advised Ms. Jones that the LIC501 that was submitted with the other documentation states that Ms. Jones resides approximately five hours from the facility and that this would prohibit her being the named administrator at this location. Ms. Jones states that she will consult with administrative staff about this and have them get back to Licensing about this. LPA Hill advised Ms. Jones that she was there to follow up on some of the previous citations issued during the annual inspections 3/13/23 and 3/14/23 and the case management inspection conducted 3/16/23. LPA Hill did provide some clearance documents for some of the citations issued.

    "narrative": "The allegation that the facility is using the incorrect medication log is related to the facility administering psychotropic medications to clients in care and not using a Psychotropic Medication Administration Record (PMAR), LIC622B, or similar form which contains all the information as required by Health and Safety Code Section 1507.6(b). The facility not using the appropriate PMAR was discovered and cited during an annual inspection conducted on 7/6/22 and again on 3/13/23 during another annual inspection. Civil penalties were assessed for repeat violation on 3/16/23, as a result of the facility still not using the required PMAR for administration of psychotropic medications. Facility has since implemented the use of the PMAR and have trained their staff on this. In addition, the facility did not have written authorization from the parent/guardian for administration of psychotropic medications. As a result of the investigation conducted by the Investigations Branch and observation(s) by LPA Hill, the allegations that facility does not maintain required ratios for high need clients and that the facility is using the incorrect medication log are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. Because these issues were recently observed, citations issued, and have since been corrected, the Department is not citing the facility at this time. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to the facility.\n\nno proof that C1 exchanged inappropriate photos with adults or other individual(s) online. Staff interviewed denied witnessing C1 in the chat room or witnessing C1 exchange any inappropriate photos while using the facility's computer. The facility's technology staff have since blocked access to cites that have been identified as inappropriate or unauthorized. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, the allegation that C1 exchanged inappropriate photos with an adults online and joined multiple adult pornographic sites is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. No citations were issued at this time. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to the facility.",

LPA Hill informed NAME that the investigation included an initial inspection on 2/16/23 followed by the Department's Investigations Branch complete investigation. The investigation was conducted by Investigator Andrew Murrow. The allegation that the facility does not maintain required ratios for high need clients is related to the facility acceping clients that need additional supervision or the one staff to one client ratio (1:1) and not providing the staffing to meet that need. Investigation showed that C1 (see LIC811 dated 5/17/23) required a 1:1 staff person supervising them and since there were two clients in the facility there should have been a minimum of two staff persons at all times but the facility did not provide that level of staffing as needed. This was observed and cited during a case management inspection to the facility on 3/16/23.",

From 02/10/2024 to present the Department has received an increased number of Incident Reports involving C1 vandalizing the neighbor's property (02/10, 02/12, 02/15, 02/16, 02/22 x 2, 02/27, 03/04 and 03/05) and Ring videos of C1\u2019s vandalism behaviors of the neighbor's property which has resulted in the client receiving two restraining orders and the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors involvement. The Department acknowledges that facility has since recognized the need to implement new plans and has made efforts to prevent C1 from vadalizing neighbor\u2019s property. However, when behaviors began week 1, seven Ring videos have captured C1 without staff present on neighbor\u2019s front porch. Based on the records reviewed, and staff interviews, LPA also learned that staff do not feel adequately trained to meet the needs of C1. The Department is requesting in writing a timeline to the Department in of what they have done and intend to do going forward. Additionally, the agency will provide a 3 day notice of C1's relocation due to clients needs exceeding plan of operation. The agency will submit this documentation to the Department on 03/11/2024. No deficiencies will be cited. Exit interview conducted at 03:15 PM. A copy of the report was provided by email to the Administrator . Continued on LIC809C",

Present from Peoples Care is: John O'Brien, NorCal District Manager, Michelle Mainez, Chief Operating Officer, Diane McGill, Program Administrator, and Quinisha Silva, Program Administrator. Present from Alta Regional Center is: Toby Golden, Client Services Manager. The purpose of the office meeting is to review the current status of Non-Compliance plan. The following NCC primary areas of concern were reviewed: supervision, staff to child ratio, training, reporting requirements, vape pen and board accountability. It was acknowledged that Peoples Care Quality Assurance created and implemented a training program and have continued to conduct ongoing training as requested. Incident reporting has increased. The compliance for each location: People's Care Shawmutt, People's Care Kenneth, and People's Care Pleides was reviewed for the time period of May 2023- May 2024. The following current existing concerns were discussed: staffing to meet the needs of clients in care, not utilizing the emergency intervention plan as identified in facility's plan of operation when required and board accountability. Based on record reviews, the Shawmutt and Pleides locations have not had one complaint opened in the last 12 months and the citations issued have decreased. As a result, these locations will be removed from the non-compliance plan. The Kenneth location has had increased complaints and increased citations and will remain on the NCC for an additional six months. Increased oversight will remain in effect through 11/08/2024. Continued on LIC809C\n\nThe Department requests a revision of the Emergency Intervention plan be submitted within thirty days with clear directives on each of the different techniques and when they will be utilized along with the verification that staff have been trained on the use of the techniques outlined based on defined behaviors.

During confidential interviews, two of two staff present with C1 at Urban Air Adventure Park corroborate that a male individual approached C1 and hit him while he was in line for an attraction.

However, C1 broke a laptop that belonged to the aggressor\u2019s niece before this incident occurred while staff were exiting the previous attraction line. Because the staff made the decision to participate in the zipline activity, line of site supervision was not maintained. Record review of video verifies the staff did not observe the property destruction and therefore, did not intervene prior which allowed for client to suffer an injury while in care.

The following statements were made, \u201cWhat can we do? This is a children\u2019s home,\u201d and \u201cWe can\u2019t put hands on them.\u201d The facility\u2019s Program Statement states in the Run Away/ Emergency Intervention Plan section \u201cIf a child is in imminent danger, physical containment according to CPI will be utilized.\u201d Record review of incident reports indicate that C1 ran in and out of traffic on busy streets, entered a body shop with hazards -cars hanging and stayed for over an hour and grabbed scissors and began threatening others. Staff called law enforcement for assistance. Staff did provide supervision to C1 but, did not follow their program statement when imminent danger occurred which made it inadequate supervision to meet the client\u2019s needs.

C1 denied being left at home alone. All staff interviewed corroborate that clients have not been left alone in the facility. However, confidential interviews reveal that C2 has been left alone at the facility due to staff being unaware of the minimum school day schedule on more than one occasion.

The staff, (S4) was placed on administrative leave on 05/14/2024 and terminated shortly thereafter.

    "narrative": "On 8/22/22 at 1:45PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a required annual inspection. LPA met with Interim Administrator Rizza Madlangbayan and informed of the purpose of the visit. LPA used the CARE Inspection Tool to conduct this inspection. LPA toured the facility and observed residents in care. There are four residents in care, and all are nonverbal. Residents were observed to be supervised and engaged by staff, and one resident had a therapy session with a behaviorist consultant whom facility staff provided assistance. Residents appear clean and dressed in clean, well-fitting clothes and all appeared content or playful. LPA conducted confidential interviews with two staff. Based on confidential interviews, observation, and record review, the facility is clean, bathrooms are sanitary, and activity spaces are free of hazards. Chemicals and knives are stored where inaccessible to residents. Medications are stored where inaccessible to residents, and medication administration records reflect administration is following prescriptions. There is enough food to meet the needs of residents in care. Room temperature is maintained at a comfortable temperature. Beds have clean linens, and bedrooms are kept organized and clean. The following deficiencies were observed. See LIC 809-D and LIC 9102s. 1) Administration of residents' psychotropic medications are not being logged on a separate log but instead are logged on one log. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84070. 2) The needs and services, or Individualized Program Plan (IPP), for two residents (See LIC 811) were not signed by authorized representative and only signed by the previous interim administrator. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84468.3. 3) The kitchen pantry had sticky food residue on two shelves. LPA advises that the facility clean these. 4) Hot water was measured at all three bathroom sinks at 100.4 F, which is below the required range (lower end is 105 F). LPA advises that hot water is too low. A continuation visit will be conducted to complete this inspection.

Per interviews, due to anticipating the hours would be cut, despite the hours still being in effect, no additional nurse staff was hired or sought. The resident in placement at this facility was not being switched to the nasal medication due to the physician determining that the resident would need to remain on the rectal medication, and so their nursing hours were not anticipated to be cut. During record review, neither LPA nor Interim Administrator were able to locate documentation of the nursing hours currently in effect, and the care plans do not clearly state the specifics of the nursing hours that were in effect. As such, this aspect of the care and treatment services to be provided to both residents cannot be verified, and it cannot be confirmed that the facility is following the care plans as agreed upon by the care teams. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated.

LPA was granted entry by LVN Anita Wilson and informed of the purpose of the visit. Interim Administrator Kylie LeBlanc arrived around 3PM. During visit, LPA toured the facility site, inspected facility files, observed four residents who are nonverbal, and conducted confidential interviews with 2 staff. LPA received a report from an agency overseeing the facility that the facility had painters on 12/7/22. During LPA's tour, LPA could smell the paint in the bedrooms through LPA's mask but there were not hazardous fumes. Based on interview with Interim Administrator, Interim Administrator is not sure if painters were here but stated that sometimes maintenance workers are sent and no notice given to Interim Administrator. Based on the report, the painters were painting a resident's room while all residents were at the facility, and the materials were accessible to residents, but it was not observed that residents touched any of the materials. Additionally, during LPA's tour today, LPA observed a tub of chemical cleaning wipes in an unlocked kitchen cabinet with a broken drawer above it, exposing the contents of the cabinet. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80087(g) Buildings and Grounds. Prior to Interim Administrator's arrival around 3PM, there were two staff on shift who identified themselves as not facility managers, while there were four residents present. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84065 Personnel Requirements. The facility was previously cited for this on 10/12/22. Due to the repeat violation, LPA is assessing a civil penalty of $250. See LIC 421. During visit, LPA observed that there were residents in care who had been planned to be moved to an appropriate adult placement due to aging out. The facility was previously cited on 10/12/22 with a plan to move the residents by 10/31/22. Additionally, based on observation and interview, one resident (See LIC...\n\n...811 Confidential Names for names and details) is not currently enrolled in an educational school or day program, and there is no activity schedule or plan being followed by care staff or current plan posted in the facility. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80010 Limitations on Capacity and Ambulatory Status and Section 84079 Planned Activities. Due to repeat violation of 80010, LPA is assessing a civil penalty of $250. See LIC 421. LPA observed multiple broken cabinets in the kitchen. Two cabinet doors were missing, and one drawer was missing. Based on interview, the doors and drawer have been missing for at least 5 days.

Second, based on record review and interview, the facility had not submitted all necessary documentation to verify interim administrator qualifications. In order to be qualified, an administrator must provide evidence of administrator certification. LPA requested the documents, providing a list of required documents, on 09/28/22, received an incomplete packet on 10/24/22, provided notice of missing items on 11/08/22, received confirmation on 11/17/22 that documents would be submitted, followed-up and re-requested resubmission on 12/06/22, received confirmation that documents would be resubmitted by 12/12/22, provided a reminder on 12/19/22, and LPA gave final notice to licensee under sister facility on 12/22/22. Documents have been received, and interim administrator requires an exception request for experience qualification and certification. Overall, documents were not submitted in a timely manner, and records reflect that the administrator is not fully qualified. Third, based on confidential interviews, a witness observed in December 2022 that there were four residents present and only two staff. When the witness arrived, one staff was on a break across the street for an unknown amount of time, ending only a few minutes after witness entered the facility. While that staff was outside, the facility was operating at a 1:4 ratio instead of it's required 1:2 ratio. Lastly, records reflect that medication was administered according to the prescription labels, but the prescription labels could not all be verified and/or there were issues with the prescription. One resident is prescribed medications, including psychotropic medications, by five doctors, but the facility could only verify four as doctors overseeing the resident. Additionally, of the resident's four doctors, two are an adult primary care physician and neurologist, and two are a pediatrician and a pediatric neurologist. The resident is not a minor but is currently being administered medications prescribed by two primary care physicians and two neurologists. Further, only one of the doctors is listed as the prescribing physician on the medication administration records (MARs). These issues combined indicate improper documentation, administration, and overall management of medications. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 80078, 84088, 84064, 80022, 84065.

During visit, LPA conducted two confidential staff interviews. Further investigation is needed. LPA is requesting the most current LIC 500, as the one posted in the facility does not reflect the new administrator. Additionally, LPA is requesting Interim Administrator's personnel records in order to verify qualifications. LPA sent a follow-up email at visit with a list of forms to submit for administrator approval. LPA is requesting that the above items be sent to LPA by 2/7/23 11:59PM. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report left with Interim Administrator, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "On 9/8/23, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a POC visit to follow up on a plan of correction (POC). LPA met with Interim Administrator Vanessa Baldwin and informed of the purpose of the visit. A POC was developed for a citation of 84065(d) issued on 8/8/23. See LIC 809 Annual/Required dated 8/8/23. The POC was due 8/31/23 and was to designate and train facility managers and submit the LIC 500 reflecting a facility manager (FM) on each shift, which is one of the terms of the March 2023 noncompliance conference. The POC submission was sent on time, but the following items were incomplete or missing: 1) No LIC 500 was submitted; 2) The designation forms, LIC 308 Designation of Facility Responsibility, were submitted but were completed incorrectly and are invalid. There are no names written on the designated staff lines, and the forms are not signed by the licensee designee (i.e. Administrator); 3) The FM training records for four staff were submitted, but the records do not reflect all required training topics, including appeal rights and interaction with law enforcement, neighbors, and family, which are required by the plan of operation and Title 22. LPA discussed the above with Interim Administrator and reviewed the LIC 500, LIC 308s, and training records. LPA observed that the LIC 500 needs to be updated to reflect the current FMs, and the LIC 308s need to be redone. Staff S1, hired in August 2023, is listed as a FM but no FM training was completed since hire at this facility and no documentation was in the file. Lastly, the FM training was confirmed to not include the topics listed above, and no training evaluation was completed. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, sections 84065(d)(3), 84065(k)(5), and 84065(k)(2)(E)(1). An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Interim Administrator Vanessa Baldwin, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Facility Manager Anita Wilson and informed of the purpose of the visit. During the visit, LPA observed that there were two staff working and two residents, who both require 1:1 supervision and support, per their individual service plans. LPA observed the staff be simultaneously responsible for meal preparation, cleaning, and administrative tasks, such as answering multiple phone calls and scheduling over the phone, as well as care and supervision. LPA also observed that the facility did not have a current license posted, which LPA previously provided to the Administrator. Lastly, LPA has advised that an exception request be submitted for the interim administrator to be approved as an administrator, due to them waiting for their administrator certification. However, no exception has been submitted, so the facility is currently out of compliance without a certified administrator nor approved exception. LPA is issuing three citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 84065.2, 84009, and 84064. Additionally, due to repeat violation within 12 months of section 84064(b), LPA is assessing a civil penalty of $250. See attached LIC 421FC.

Staff have valid first aid and CPI certifications, LVN staff have valid licenses, and facility managers have complete training covering the required topics. The facility is continuing to hire staff to maintain staff to client ratios. LPA observed staff interactions during inspection, including resident de-escalation, and observed staff to communicate well and understand the appropriate facility and de-escalation procedures to follow. The facility has designated an administrator to oversee only one facility. The facility also maintains communication with outside agencies, including Community Care Licensing, Regional Center, and resident schools. LPA observed the facility to be operating in compliance with the NCC terms. No deficiency citations were issued at today's visit, and there are no outstanding plans of correction (POCs).

LPA observed the job shadowing portion of the training to be missing indication of the time spent on each activity. Administrator stated over the phone that S3 completed additional training and the initial training, and LPA explained that all training needs to be documented and maintained in personnel records on site.

LPA met with Facility Manager Maria Gonzvales and informed of the purpose of the visit. On multiple dates since December 2023, the facility has not followed the required staff to resident ratios. Staff statements and record review indicate that on multiple occassions, a staff member has worked as the only staff on site with four residents present, including two residents (R1 and R2) who both require one to one supervision per their care plans. LPA observed that the health care plan for R1 has not been updated within 6 months, as it is dated April 2023. LPA reviewed the other care plans in the record and observed that the health care plan has not been combined with another care plan. LPA observed that seizure activity was noted in the shift notes on 2/3/24 for R1 but was not logged in the seizure log, as required by the resident's care plan. Additionally, nurse shift notes indicate that there was no nurse working on 2/3/24 PM when the seizure occurred nor 2/4/24 AM. The LIC 500 provided to LPA on 2/8/24 reflects that only one staff is scheduled to work from 6AM to 7AM, no staff is scheduled to work on Mondays from 6AM to 7AM, only one staff is scheduled to work on Mondays from 7AM to 9AM, no administrator or manager is scheduled to work on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 6AM to 9AM nor on Fridays from 6AM to 2PM. Staff statements do not confirm that these shifts were in fact uncovered. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and Section 84069.2 Individualized Health Care Plans for Specialized Group Homes. LPA also advises ensuring the LIC 500 reflects appropriate coverage for all hours.

R1 stated that Staff S2 was poking R1 in the head for no reason. R1 also stated that both staff S1 and S2 used \u201cbad words\u201d to him. During an interview, S1 admitted to taking R1 by the arm to get R1 off a chair. S1 stated that he took R1\u2019s wrist and placed it behind R1\u2019s back, and placed R1 on the floor in a restraint. S1 denied causing the injuries to R1, stating that R1 did it to themselves. S1 admitted to performing a one-person restraint on R1. S1 also stated that Staff S2 performed a single person restraint after R1 kicked S2 in the legs. S1 stated that R1 caused the injuries by scratching himself. S1 denied cursing at R1. During an interview, S2 stated that the restraint was a two-person restraint in which Staff S1 participated in. S2 stated that after the restraint, R1 got up and was observed to be rubbing his neck with his hand. However, S2 stated he was could not say for sure that R1 scratched himself. S2 admitted to cursing during this incident but stated it was directed more at the situation and not at R1. S2 could not recall what cuss words were used. In reviewing the facility\u2019s internal Investigation Report conducted by the facility\u2019s District Manager (DM), both Staff S1 and S2 had submitted written and signed statements, making consistent statements that a restraint was performed on the resident R1 after R1 had thrown a plate of food at staff. However, S1\u2019s statements detail S2 performing a one-person restraint first and then S1 performing a one-person restraint later. S2\u2019s written statement and verbal interview with the DM differed in that S2 stated to DM that they had performed a one-person hold on R1, placing R1\u2019s arm behind his back to hold R1 in place. In reviewing the Citrus Heights Police Department report, R1 stated that staff threw him down to the floor, causing injuries. The police report documents the following injuries on R1: R1 had slight swelling to right jaw. Approximate \u00bd\u201d abrasion or scrape above top lip beneath right nostril and area was slightly reddened in color. R1 showed his upper lip was swollen and had formed a small 1/4'\u201d round purple blood blister. Inside of R1\u2019s bottom lip also had dried blood across the back. There were a series of fresh, large scratches under his chin, at the top of his chest and at bottom of neck.

    "narrative": "Continued from LIC 9099... During interviews, six staff members explained they received adequate and extensive training from a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN), on how to maintain medication logs, use sterile procedures, and properly store medication. They also reported having job shadowed the process. The staff\u2019s descriptions of the training align with the program statement training procedures. One staff member, however, disclosed feeling uncomfortable administering medication because they had only job shadowed prior to being expected to administer themselves, which does not meet the expectations outlined in the facility program statement training procedures. This staff member, however, was initially hired and trained at the Kenneth, People\u2019s Care facility, which will be addressed separately. Based upon the comparison between the amount of staff members (5) interviewed who stated that staff do not raise their voice and the one staff who stated they do, as well as upon the evidence of non-violent crisis and de-escalation training taken, the allegation \u201cStaff yell at minors in care,\u201d cannot be proven true. Furthermore, based upon the amount of staff members interviewed (6) who stated they received adequate training for administering medication as well as upon the verification of medication provided by file review, the allegation \u201cUnqualified staff are passing out medication,\u201d cannot be proven true.

This report was provided to the facility as a complaint investigation report when this inspection should have been a case management. During the course of the complaint investigation #23-CR-20230215111337, LPA observed deficiencies during a physical plant inspection of the facility. A description of those observations are as follows: On 6/2/2023, two client IPPs were reviewed with the administrator. Client #1\u2019s IPP dated July 2022 states \u201cWhen Connor first moved to the care home he had 1 to 1 support but due to his aggressive behavior he was put on Health and Safety Waiver and currently has 2 to 1 support.\u201d Upon LPA\u2019s arrival to the home on this date, there was only one staff present, instead of the required three staff. As a result of this observation, facility was cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, Chapter 5, Regulation 84065.5(c): Staff Child Ratios. Record review and administrator\u2019s statement confirm that current IPP does not match the staffing that is in place in the home. On 6/2/2023, during the home inspection, an unsecured kitchen knife was discovered in a kitchen drawer. Program RN Zahrad Griffin secured the knife in the sharps container during LPA\u2019s visit. As a result of this observation, facility was also cited for the following violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1. Article 07 Physical Environment 80087 Buildings and Grounds (g) (1). Statement from RN confirms that knife was left in the silverware drawer unsecured. Due to these observations and deficiencies being erroneously provided on incorrect documents on 7/17/2023, the documentation and deficiencies are being reissued today, 8/17/2023 and have been cleared today. Exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report and appeal rights were left at the facility. End of report.",

Staff member Jamie Hicks and Adiyana Hughes arrived shortly after. Adminstrator Kourtney Hamilton arrived at 3:00 p.m. A tour of the home was conducted upon arrival.

LPA conducted a walk-through of the facility and observed: Two client bedrooms, one dining area, two living rooms, two bathrooms, the garage, the kitchen, the staff office, the backyard, and front yard. All ramps/passageways were clear, the water temperature on one of the clients' bathrooms measured 109.6 degrees Fahrenheit which is within the required range of 105 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. There was an adequate amount of perishable and non-perishable foods, which were stored correctly. One of the cabinet doors in the kitchen was broken. There was a Keurig coffee machine which delivered water that measured at 180 degrees Fahrenheit. There was a carbon monoxide detector in the house which was operable, and the two smoke detectors in the living room and dining area had their batteries popped out, making them ineffective. Staff popped the batteries back in during this inspection. The first aid kit was complete aside from missing tweezers. The clients' medications were locked. The emergency disaster plan posted in the office was out of date and had a staff on there who has not worked at the facility for some time. There was another emergency disaster plan posted in the living room which had that same staff, as well as multiple other staff that no longer work at the facility listed. The facility received an advisory note for this on 12/1/2022. During this inspection the Administrator updated the form.\n\nThe written Emergency Disaster and Mass Casualty plan was missing descriptions of the facility's shut off valves and how to use them, provisions for emergency power, and provisions for managing medication, including refrigerated medications, in the event of an emergency. The Administrator updated the plan to meet requirements on this date. Training on this plan has not been completed as the plan was not complete, however the facility will be having an all staff training on 11/21/2023, in which all staff will be trained on this plan. The facility has an outstanding annual bill of $454, due as of yesterday. During this inspection, that was paid. The facility is conducting fire and other emergency drills as required. Board Minutes are available for review and show the Board providing oversight of the facility. One client has incontinence and is supplied diapers as necessary. LPA reviewed two client files and found: Both clients in this children's residential facility are non-minors. Non-minors are allowed to stay in children's residential facilities until their 21st birthday, however when 100% of the facility's population are adults, discussions about transition plans need to be had. LPA issued a Technical Assistance Advisory Note, which is not a citation, advising the facility to communicate with CCL about their plans to transition one or both of the clients to another facility, such as an Adult Residential Facility, the facility transition into an Adult Residential Facility, OR some other solution agreeable to the facility and CCL, for example. As of 11/9/2023, the facility has halted use of restraints on clients due to training needs and plans to utilize other forms of physical intervention, such as Ukeru pads. The facility is not attempting to assist clients with developing the skills necessary for self-sufficiency, listed under section 84478(c) of the regulations, to the point that they may be able to understand. While the clients may not be able to comprehend these concepts, the facility still should be making attempts to share the information with the clients. This can be documented in the quarterly reports (Needs and Services Plans) or annual reports.\n\nThe facility administered one of the client's their afternoon medication early, when they got home at around 3:00 PM, but their medication was supposed to be given at 4:00 PM. FM explained that this is due to another medication being given to the client at 3:00 PM, and giving them to the client at the same time is less disruptive for the client. LPA and FM looked at the prescription and saw that the issuing time is 4:00 PM. LPA advised FM to contact the doctor to request to change it to 3:00 PM. LPA explained to FM that not following the times and still marking in the record that it was given at 4:00 PM, is inaccurate, and if changes need to be made for the benefit of the client, they need to take action to make the changes. FM called the doctor's office during this inspection, left a message, and emailed them as well. One client returned to the facility during LPA's inspection, however was having behaviors which were not conducive to LPA interviewing the client. LPA will interview the client on another date when they are in a better space. The other client returned to the facility later on. On this date the facility is being cited for violations of: California Code of Regulations, Tittle 22, Division 5, Section 80023(a); and the Non-Minor Dependent Interim Licensing Standards Sections 84470(b)(2)(F) and 84487(e)(2). LPA is issuing five technical violation advisory notes, which are not citations, for the following sections: 84468.3(f), 84478(c), HSC1565(d), HSC1565(b), and HSC1565(a), as well as two technical assistance advisory notes. LPA will return on another date to complete this inspection. An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report and appeal rights was left with her.",

LPA reviewed three staff files, the Facility Manager file, and the Administrator's file and found: All staff, facility managers, and Administrator are fingerprint cleared and associated to the facility as required. There is a staff schedule which is posted, however it was not fully accurate, and was missing staff titles, and time off. FM corrected this during the inspection. There are two qualified Facility Managers on the schedule currently, however there is no adequate Facility Manager coverage during night shifts, and sometimes during the weekend. One staff's CPR/1st Aid was expired by two days, however Administrator stated they have taken it, but the proof is in the staff's email, which they cannot yet access. CCL approved an exception request for Ashley Johnson on 11/8/2023 to temporarily act as Administrator over the Pleides house until FM Quinisha Silva can become the Administrator. The exception request was granted based on Ashley waiting to obtain the passed Administrator Certificate, as it just has not been issued yet. Upon further review of the requirements and files, neither Quinisha nor Ashley meet the education and experience requirements. LPA advised FM, Administrator, and District Manager (DM) John O'Brien that CCL will be discussing this matter and deciding the best way to move forward, working with the facility. New exception requests will likely need to be submitted.\n\nFiles showed that a Behaviorist meets monthly with the two clients as required and the facility maintains records of their consultation hours and type of services provided as required. Staff are generally unaware of the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standards (RPPS), and there is currently not an intentionally designated person per shift who will apply it to situations with the clients, per regulation. The Administrator is aware of RPPS, and when LPA explained what they are to FM, she knows what they are as well. FM stated this can be added to the all staff training being held on 11/21/2023. LPA also shared a link to more information about RPPS on the Department's website, with DM. LPA interviewed two clients and two staff. Based on interviews with clients, their needs are being met and they are being treated with dignity and respect. Based on interviews with staff, LPA found trainings on Mandated Reporting and the Emergency Intervention Plan need to be conducted to give staff a better understanding of them, otherwise, staff were knowledgeable about their job and the important aspects of the program. On this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 5, Section 84065(d). LPA is also issuing three advisory notes, which are not citations. An exit interview was conducted with staff Osman Bangura and a copy of this report and appeal rights were sent to Administrator and Facility Manager, who had to leave before the inspection was complete.",

Subsequent to the findings made on 7/17/2023, CCL received additional information. LPAs received facility T-Logs, Psychotropic Medication Administration Records (PMARs), Quarterly Reports, Behavior Consultant data, Staff Data Reports, Data Tracking Sheets, and another Facility Incident Report. Dates for this data provided was sporadic and varied due to admitted and observed record keeping failures by the facility. Based on the records reviewed, LPAs found many reportable incidents which were not reported to CCL as required. Due to the facility's insufficient record keeping, the following is only a partial summary. Incident Reports were not received: For client C1 (see confidential names list), in August 2022, an incident involving C1's physical aggression and property destruction. In September 2022, C1 was physically restrained due due physical aggression towards staff. In October of 2022, C1 was physically restrained for hitting another client. On 12/17/2022, C1 was placed on a 5150 hold. On 11/20/2022, C1 had escalated behaviors, including self-injurious behaviors (SIB) for close to six hours. In February 2022, the Staff Data Report shows there were 87 incidents of, \"Property Destruction,\" \"Self-Injury,\" and \"Aggression,\" from C1, however no incident reports were received in the month of February 2022.\n\nIn January 2022 on the Data Tracking Sheets, for C1, there were five incidents of SIB, three incidents of property destruction, and five incidents of aggression noted, however none of these incidents were reported to CCL. In February 2022 on the Data Tracking Sheets, for C1, there were 27 incidents of SIB, 18 incidents of property destruction, and 43 incidents of aggression noted, however, none of these incidents were reported to CCL. In March 2022 on the Data Tracking Sheets, for C1, there was one incident of SIB, three incidents of property destruction, and 15 incidents of aggression noted, however, none of these incidents were reported to CCL. In the Updated Summary of C1's Quarterly Report, there was one instance of high-intensity problem behavior; C1 gained access to the staff office, broke the TV off of the wall, and kicked a hole in the bathroom door. This incident was not reported to CCL. On this date the facility is receiving a citation for the violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Reporting Requirements, Section 80061(b)(1)(E), detailed on the D-Page. LPM and LPAs also discussed with People's Care the current Administrators' qualifications and exception requests for Kenneth and Pleides houses. LPM informed People's Care that CCL will approve the exception requests for Ashley Johnson (Kenneth) and Quinisha Silva (Pleides) for one year, with the condition that both will pursue a continuation of education to work towards meeting the regulatory requirements. An exit interview was conducted with all present, and a copy of this report, confidential names list, and appeal rights were issued to John O'Brien.",

The purpose of this inspection is to assess an Enhanced Civil Penalty regarding licensed Group Home, People\u2019s Care Pleides (PCP). On 7/17/2023, LPA Monica Roberts and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Jodean Hall delivered findings for the complaint investigation regarding the substantiated allegation that, \u201cfacility staff inappropriately medicated a client.\u201d On 12/12/2023, LPAs Burgess, Roberts, and Goldie, LPM Hall, and Regional Manager (RM) Margo Castaneda delivered an addendum to those findings to PCP, in-office. Over the course of the investigation, CCL found that the facility supplied marijuana, in the form of a THC vape pen, to a client under 21 years of age with an expired prescription, as well as permitted the client to use the vape pen exceeding the prescribed dosage. Additionally, CCL found that a former Administrator and staff simultaneously allowed the client dosing over what was prescribed and/or without a prescription in regard to the client's psychotropic medications, and that the Administrator procured additional psychotropic medications without the knowledge nor approval of the client\u2019s regular Psychiatrist. After consulting with our Department's Clinical Consultant, the case was evaluated and based on exhibited behaviors was determined to be a restraint, without a valid doctor's order to control the client's aggressive behaviors. On 7/17/2023 the facility was cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Section 84072(d), Personal Rights for this violation, which was then amended on 12/12/2023 and re-delivered to PCP.\n\nBased on confidential interviews and records review, the Department has determined that the Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted for the physical abuse of a client in care by way of a chemical restraint, defined in Welfare & Institutions Code (WIC) 15610.63(f), while in the care of PCP. Health & Safety Code (HSC) 1548(f)(1)(C)(i): For a violation that the department determines constitutes physical abuse, as defined in paragraph (2), or resulted in serious bodily injury, as defined in Section 243 of the Penal Code, to a person receiving care at a therapeutic day services facility, community treatment facility, transitional shelter care facility, transitional housing placement provider, small family home, crisis nursery, group home, enhanced behavioral supports home licensed as a group home, group home for children with special health care needs, or short-term residential therapeutic program, the civil penalty shall be assessed as follows: (i) Two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for a facility licensed to care for 40 or fewer children. On this date, the Department issuing an immediate Enhanced Civil Penalty of $2,500. An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided",

On this date, the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, 1. 80075(k)(6): Health Related Services. The following requirements shall apply to medications which are centrally stored: Each client's medication shall be stored in its originally received container (for medication M6 - see confidential names list dated 2/2/2024). 2. 84070(b)(13): Children's Records.

This deficiency was corrected during this inspection. LPA reviewed the Centrally Stored Medication and Destruction Records for C1's correct medications, and all prescription numbers match the current medications. On 2/2/2024 LPA found that two of C1's medications had incorrect prescription numbers on the Psychotropic Medication Administration Records (M1 & M3). LPA is writing an advisory note, which is not a citation, for these errors.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility and met with staff Kamaree Burton, Facility Manager Quinisha Silva, and Administrator Ashley Johnson, who assisted with the inspection. LPA reviewed client medications and Psychotropic Medication Administration Records (PMARs). Clients will be referred to as C1 and C2. LPA found: the facility's mail-order pharmacy sends bubble packs of pills to the facility around the middle of the month. However, the PMARs begin on the 1st of the month. There is no indication on the PMARs when a new bubble pack is started, and it is difficult to determine without staff's knowledge. LPA advised the facility to create a new PMAR anytime there is a new prescription number for the same medication. LPA also advised the facility to create a new PMAR when a new bubble pack is started, OR, clearly indicate on the PMAR the date the new bubble pack was started, and when it should end. See Confidential Names List: For C1, LPA found: Medication 1 (M1) had an incorrect prescription number in the PMAR; M2's prescription filled date is missing from the PMAR; M3 had an incorrect prescription number in the PMAR, however FM corrected it during the inspection. For M4 and M5, PMAR is missing Quantity Prescribed, Prescription Filled Date, # of Refills. For M6, the pills were split from the original box into two different boxes noted as AM and PM. The other box was just an old pill box with an old label. When LPA counted M6, there were 30 pills, and a full box is 60 pills. LPA asked FM what date did C2 start the pills. FM stated 1/11/2024. All time slots were marked as taken for M6, with none missed or refused. By that count, there would be a surplus of 14 pills.\n\nLater, FM found that it actually started on 1/19/2024, and the counts added up. LPA explained to FM that this is a good example to show the importance of creating a new PMAR when a new box is opened. LPA found the dosage for M7 in the bubble packs was twice than what was in the PMARs for M7. The PMARs stated M7 200MG is the dosage per two tablets, which are taken twice daily. However it should have been 400MG per two tablets, twice daily, for a total of 800MG/daily. FM called the Pharmacy to confirm the right medication was in the bubble packs, and the pharmacy confirmed. FM corrected the PMAR on this date to reflect the correct dosage. Additionally, the 5PM initial space for staff to indicate medication was issued, was blank for 2/1/2024 for M7, even though the medication was given. FM stated this was due to not including the 5PM time slot on the PMAR initially, so staff did not know to initial there. This was corrected on the PMAR. Beyond this medication review, CCL also received an incident report from the facility dated 12/28/2023, which details the following medication errors: Client C1 was given incorrect doses of one of their medications on 12/23/2023-12/27/2023 at 7am, 11am, 3pm, and 7pm; the 1MG dose was given instead of 2MG dose. The facility identified this was due to the facility using old medication that was set to be destroyed while awaiting a medication refill. This medication that was utilized was the incorrect dose. Refills were not obtained in advance as they should have been, and staff should have noticed this error immediately if they looked closely and completed the count protocol per their training. To prevent delays in getting refills, the facility will be switching over to a different pharmacy which can better serve their needs. LPA was unable to complete the inspection on this date, due to the time. LPA will return on a later date to complete the inspection. An exit interview was conducted with Admin and FM and a copy of this report and confidential names lists were provided to them.",

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Kyane and LPM Kim observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to the Facility District Manager John O'Brien and the Facility Administrator Quinisha Silva.",

Present from Peoples Care is: John O'Brien, NorCal District Manager, Michelle Mainez, Chief Operating Officer, Diane McGill, Program Administrator, and Quinisha Silva, Program Administrator. Present from Alta Regional Center is: Toby Golden, Client Services Manager. The purpose of the office meeting is to review the current status of Non-Compliance plan. The following NCC primary areas of concern were reviewed: supervision, staff to child ratio, training, reporting requirements, vape pen and board accountability. It was acknowledged that Peoples Care Quality Assurance created and implemented a training program and have continued to conduct ongoing training as requested. Incident reporting has increased. The compliance for each location: People's Care Shawmutt, People's Care Kenneth, and People's Care Pleides was reviewed for the time period of May 2023- May 2024. The following current existing concerns were discussed: staffing to meet the needs of clients in care, not utilizing the emergency intervention plan as identified in facility's plan of operation when required and board accountability. Based on record reviews, the Shawmutt and Pleides locations have not had one complaint opened in the last 12 months and the citations issued have decreased. As a result, these locations will be removed from the non-compliance plan. The Kenneth location has had increased complaints and increased citations and will remain on the NCC for an additional six months. Increased oversight will remain in effect through 11/08/2024. Continued on LIC809C\n\nThe Department requests a revision of the Emergency Intervention plan be submitted within thirty days with clear directives on each of the different techniques and when they will be utilized along with the verification that staff have been trained on the use of the techniques outlined based on defined behaviors. An Administrator Exception Request needs to be submitted to the Department immediately. A copy of this report was provided via email to John O'Brien, District Manager for signature.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility regarding a medication error reported to CCL on 5/23/2024. Present during this inspection was LVN Alex Jenkins and Administrator Diane McGill, who assisted LPA with the inspection. LVN was training new nursing staff Lillian Hull during this inspection. The incident report dated 5/23/2024 stated that one client, C1 (see Confidential Names List dated 5/31/2024), had been in the hospital from 4/28/2024 to 5/3/2024, returning with new medications that were to start on 5/7/2024. On the 7th, LVN and QA Specialist conducted a full medication audit. After the aduit, Administrator Quinisha Silva was instructed to create new Medication Administration Records (MARs) and to remove the old medication and put it in the destruction box for destruction. Admin affirmed this was understood. All old medications were placed in the destruction box and new MARs were created, with the exception of one medication, M1. Due to this, C1 was given both the old and new doses of M1 from 5/7/2024 - 5/21/2024, 15 additional doses. Once this was discovered, C1 was evaluated at the hospital for observation, with no issues. LVN audited the medications once again on 5/22/2024. An interview was conducted with Admin on 5/29/2024 regarding this incident. During that interview LPA was informed that it was Admin's mistake not to have removed the medication, however C1 was only given the extra doses of M1 for a maximum of four days. Admin had instructed the staff to put the old medication at the bottom of the medication cabinet, and to not give it out to C1.\n\nLPA requested the M1 MAR that was supposed to have been removed, and the new one, however when LVN looked for them, they appeared to have gone missing from where she put them in the binder. LVN believed it was likely destroyed. LPA observed the medication destruction area and found there to be a chemical solution in which the staff put the medications to dissolve, and another trunk where meds will sometimes go to be later destroyed in the bottom area of the medication cabinet. LPA reviewed C1's medications and MARs together with LVN. LPA found for M2 for MAR 5/2024, the fill date was incorrect as it stated it was filled on 12/19/2023, when it had actually been filled on 5/8/2024. On M2's MAR from 5/17/2024 - 5/21/2024, there were X's on the current MAR, and LVN stated there was another MAR where it was filled out for 5/17/2024 - 5/21/2024, however that MAR was unable to be located. M3 was started on 5/23/2024, the MAR showed this as well, given through today, there are 27 pills that have been taken. There are 39 left, which leaves an excess of one dose. After review it appears it might be an error on the pharmacy's initial count, however that is not certain. M1 for 5/22/2024 showed there was the same problem, one extra dose. The MAR showed 9 doses have been taken, and there are 13 left. However, there should have only been 21 total and based on counts, there is one extra dose. LVN called the pharmacy and found the pharmacy did make an error. The pharmacy asked LVN to check the rest and call back so any others can be corrected too. When LPA and LVN were done with the medication review, the pharmacy was out to lunch. When LPA returns to complete this case management, LVN will have obtained the corrected MARs and will have them, clearly understandable, at the facility for LPA's review. For M4, there are 13 daily doses left, the counts should add up to 28, which is what was filled. However, there were 3 different MARs for the same med, M4, with different numbers, different dates, which was indecipherable. It was filled at 42 pills, it started 5/23/2024 in the PM. 16 pills were marked as taken, 27 were left, totalling 43. Based on the MAR and physical medication, there is one extra pill (a half of a daily dose), which cannot be explained. CSMDR stated M6 was filled on 5/22/2024 60 pills (1 taken twice daily), MAR stated began 5/23/2024. There were 43 left, and 17 taken, which was accurate. For M7,\n\nthe CSMDR stated 80 pills of M7 was destroyed on 5/23/2024. However, M7 is still present and being administered. LVN could not explain what happened. There are 54 M7 left, so 58 were supposedly given, however the MAR only stated 38 were given. For M8, it was filled on 5/22/2024, it was started on 5/23/2024. There were 28 left, and 16 given, so they added up accurately. M9 was accurate. M10 is a PRN. LPA collected copies of MARs and CSMDRs. After conferring with LPA's supervisor, LPA will be returning on a later date to address the multiple medication errors found during this inspection, and the medication error of the incident report for which the case management was started. Administrator and LVN conducted a medication training, which was pre-scheduled, with all staff during this inspection. Administrator and LVN expressed the severe importance of medication accuracy. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report was provided to her.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Jodean Hall made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility for the purpose of addressing the deficiencies found at the facility on 5/31/2024 and for the case management opened that day. Based on the incident report submitted to CCL by the facility and statements from the Administrator, LPA confirmed the facility did administer an extra dose of C1's M1 (refer to Confidential Names List dated 5/31/2024) from 5/7/2024 - 5/21/2024, 15 additional doses, due to the facility not destroying the old medication as required, and not replacing the MAR as required. Additionally, revealed on 5/31/2024 during LPA and LVN's medication review for C1, LPA found the following: 1. The old MAR for the overdosed M1 was missing and believed by LVN and District Manager to have been destroyed, so LPA could not review it. 2. On M2's MAR from 5/17/2024 - 5/21/2024, there were X's on the current MAR, and LVN stated there was another MAR where it was filled out for 5/17/2024 - 5/21/2024, however that MAR was unable to be located. 3. For M2 the fill date was incorrect as it stated it was filled on 12/19/2023, when it had actually been filled on 5/8/2024. 4. M3 was started on 5/23/2024, the MAR showed this as well, given through today, there are 27 pills that have been taken. There are 39 left, which leaves an excess of one dose. 5.

However, there should have only been 21 total and based on counts, there is one extra dose.\n\n6. For M4, there are 13 daily doses left, the counts should add up to 28, which is what was filled. However, there were 3 different MARs for the same med, M4, with different numbers, different dates, which was indecipherable. It was filled at 42 pills, it started 5/23/2024 in the PM. 16 pills were marked as taken, 27 were left, totalling 43. Based on the MAR and physical medication, there is one extra pill (a half of a daily dose), which cannot be explained. 7. For M7, the CSMDR stated 80 pills of M7 was destroyed on 5/23/2024. However, M7 is still present and being administered. LVN could not explain what happened. There are 54 M7 left, so 58 were supposedly given, however the MAR only stated 38 were given. The two medication errors for M3 and M1 with the counts being off by one, the LVN was to have called the pharmacy to obtain the correct records for this, however on this date during this inspection, that had not yet been completed. Administrator informed LPA that LVN is working on it right now. LVN called Admin and informed LPA that for both M1 and M3, the MAR should have started on 5/23/2024, so staff started it a day earlier. The facility had to switch the medication packs, so the new tray came on the 23rd. The MARs were incorrect, instead of starting the MAR on the 23rd, they continued on the old MAR. On 5/31/2024, LPA did not have access to the facility safe, in which client funds and financial records are kept. LPA was informed that since 5/24/2024, the facility has not had access. Administrator informed LPA that they have been working to get it open and she has been in contact with HR. Administrator forwarded LPA the email chain discussing this. On this date, there was still no access to the facility safe. LPA and LPM spoke with District Manager John O'Brien on this date, who called a person to come open it today. On this date, the facility is being cited for repeated violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Section 80075(l) Health Related Services, and Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision, and Section 84070(b)(13) (third repeat citation in one year) Children's Records, and a repeat civil penalty in the amount of $250 for each will be assessed. For each day the deficiencies go uncorrected, an additional $100 per citation, per day, will be assessed.\n\nOn this date, LPM requested copies of the 15-Minute Checks for C1's medication for May. LPM was informed that most of them were shredded, however four of them for May 2024 were left. There were no medication names on any of them to determine which checks were done for which medications, so the documentation was not useful. The facility is also being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Inspection Authority of the Department of Licensing Agency, Sections 84044(b), and 80044(c). An exit interview was conducted with DM and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to him.",

Other interviews indicated that C1 has aggressive tendencies toward staff including charging at them, spraying water and soap on the kitchen floor causing the floor to be slippery so staff would fall if attempting to follow C1 throughout the facility and outside. In addition, C1's additional behaviors include punching holes in wall(s), causing property damage throughout the facility, self harm, including banging their head on walls, door frames, and scratching themselves, to name a few. Interviews with other staff members present during the alleged incident denied seeing S1 be aggressive towards C1 or strike C1 in any way. All individuals present indicated that C1 had sprayed water and soap on the kitchen floor causing it to be slippery, resulting in C1 falling several times during the alleged incident, hitting their face and body, sustaining the described injuries. Staff interviewed also indicated that the facility is \"hands off\" meaning their protocol is to evade client aggression and to not engage in restraints for their safety and the safety of clients in care. Facility staff are currently being trained in a different behavior intervention program but will continue to not restrain clients in care. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted, and documentation reviewed, the allegation that staff physically assaulted client (C1) which resulted in injuries is UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "On 7/24/2024, when LPA was inspecting the client's room, a staff was in their bathroom mopping. When LPA entered the bathroom, a strong scent of marijuana was present. When LPA interviewed that staff, he denied being high and denied smoking at the facility. The staff stated the smell is probably from their jacket, when they smoked in their own free time. During interviews with staff, LPA was informed by the two staff who were smoking in front of the client the day of the picture being taken, that it was only a nicotine vape, that sometimes the client is out there with them, but they try to have the client go inside. The other staff that was in the picture initially denied anyone smoking in front of the client, but when showed the picture and asked about it, stated that on a rare occasion the client will be out there, but not usually. All three staff denied smoking marijuana at the facility, or staff being high while working. The staffs' stories were corroborative in that two staff share a nicotine vape, and since the job is stressful, they will take a puff on the nicotine vape outside. LPA also learned through interviews with staff that one of their neighbors makes frequent unreasonable complaints about the facility. LPA was informed by staff that when they would go out front to smoke, the neighbor would complain, so they did it in the backyard instead. One staff showed LPA the vape he uses and it is a disposable nicotine vape. The staff demonstrated to LPA the puff from the vape and it had no scent of marijuana, only flavoring, like a nicotine vape. During an interview with a staff, LPA learned that the client's marijuana vape pen smells of marijuana when smoked. Due to staff smoking on facility property and in the presence of a client, the facility is being cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Buildings and Grounds, 84087(c). Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

CCL received two incident reports dated 8/23/2024 and 9/15/2024 which detailed medication errors made with client C1's medication. 8/23/2024: QA confirmed that C1 had a missed dose of M1 (see Confidential Names List dated 10/15/2024). QA reviewed the medication packs and found the M1 bubble packs started on different days, and staff informed QA that it was because there was a single pill left over from the pharmacy pill bottle. QA followed up with facility nurse and staff present on that day. It is unclear whether it was an AM or PM dose which was missed. Corrective action will be given to the staff and retraining will occur. Staff will send pictures of every medication pass to QA before it is taken by the resident. 9/15/2024: During a medication audit conducted on 9/16/2024 by the facility nurse, it was discovered that one dose of M1. QA staff followed up with staff via conversation and text messaged pictures from staff, and in speaking with the staff on 9/17/2024 it was confirmed that the dose was not administered. Corrective action will be given to the staff and a retraining will occur. Staff will send pictures of every medication pass to QA staff to confirm the correct quantity is being administered. The facility was previously cited for medication dosing errors on 2/9/2024 and 6/3/2024.\n\nIn a corrective action plan submitted to CCL by People's Care on 6/3/2024 for multiple medications violations cited on that date (See 809 dated 6/3/2024), part of the submitted plan stated: \"Implementation of the \u201cRed Apron\u201d Protocol in conjunction with photos of each and every medication pass will be the new standard at the Pleides Group Home for the foreseeable future. The \u201cRed Apron\u201d Protocol will be a permanent addition to the Pleides medication protocol. This new level of focused attention to detail is to ensure that the person wearing the red apron is not to be engaged by staff or the Residents while administering medications. Distractions is often the cause for errors, and we want to set our staff up for success and do everything within our power to keep our Residents safe. The photos of the medication passes will be on-going and reevaluated at a later date.\" Based on the two further medication errors occurring, this plan was either not implemented, is not being followed up on as required, or is ineffective. On this date, the facility is being cited for a repeat violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (third repeat citation in one year), and assessed a repeat citation civil penalty in the amount of $250. For each day the deficiency goes uncorrected, an additional $100 per day will be assessed.

    "narrative": "During an interview with C1\u2019s parent (W1), LPAs were informed that W1 has been paying the facility via Cashapp to reimburse their spending on C1\u2019s THC vape pens up until June 2024, and provided screenshots of these transactions. Based on a review of C1\u2019s cash resource records by the facility for April, May, and June 2024, there were no recordings of any vape purchases or reimbursements completed by the facility. LPA Goldie reviewed C1\u2019s July 2024 cash resources log in-facility on 8/13/2024, and then again in-facility on 8/28/2024 which showed that seven more entries were added to the log after 8/13/2024. This included four entries for \u201creimbursements,\u201d which indicated the facility reimbursed themselves for past vape purchases. Two of those noted vape reimbursements on 7/6/2024 did not correlate to any receipts, and amounted to $60. In addition to this, noted on 7/22/2024 there were three entries for \u201cstate fair\u201d: $39, $20, and $8 for which there were no receipts. C1 had been receiving checks from Social Security in their name. Beginning in January 2024 the checks began to accumulate at the facility. On 6/3/2024, LPA received photos of the checks that were present in the facility which were for 1/2024, 2/2024, 3/2024 4/2024, and two checks for 5/2024, totalling $7,480. Interviews with Administrator and Program Director informed LPA that the facility did not know what they were for. During LPA Goldie\u2019s inspection at the facility on 8/28/2024 she observed checks for 2/2024, 3/2024, 4/2024, two checks for 5/2024, and a check for 8/2024. There were three missing checks: 1/2024, 6/2024, and 7/2024. Based on records review, the facility cashed the 1/2024 check, and either the 6/2024 or 7/2024 check. Two checks were cashed; however, three checks were missing with one unaccounted for. On 7/9/2024 and 7/18/2024, C1 was taken to a check cashing business and was charged $23.76 each time to cash the checks. Based on LPAs\u2019 interview with W1 and review of the conservatorship paperwork, W1 is the limited conservator for C1. However, W1 informed LPAs that they were never made aware that C1 had money, that the facility cashed any of C1\u2019s checks, that the facility had spent any of C1\u2019s money, and was unaware that the facility was using C1\u2019s money to pay for the THC vapes.\n\nDuring LPA\u2019s interview with SC, LPA was informed that SC had been requesting a doctor\u2019s certification form that C1 needed to enlist W1 as the payee due to C1 not being able to manage their own money, from the facility for, \u201ca long time... at least the beginning of this year.\u201d It was not until C1\u2019s day of discharge on 9/23/2024 that the visit was completed and the form was signed. SC also informed LPA that at the beginning of the year, the Administrator at the time missed an SSI appointment to get it set up, and then when the subsequent Administrator took over, they failed to complete this as well. SC also informed LPA that the facility failed to bill for P&I moneys for C1, which C1 could have been utilizing during the length of C1\u2019s placement. Interviews with the current Administrator and Program Director informed LPA that W1 was unresponsive to them which made it difficult for them to cash the checks and attain an ID for C1. However, LPAs were informed by W1 that they visited the facility about monthly, and called the facility every Wednesday; in which case the facility would have had many opportunities to communicate with W1. Upon review of facility visitor logs for 2023 and 2024, W1 signed in on four dates: 8/12/2023, 10/21/2023, 1/13/2024, and 3/15/2024. W1 informed LPA Goldie that W1 did not sign in every time. Additionally, W1 has been highly responsive to LPAs and SC, so it is unclear if W1 was truly unresponsive to the facility. Based on LPAs\u2019 records reviewed and conducted interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Sections 80078(a) and 80022(k) are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.

The purpose of this Case Management is to address facility staff not providing factual information to employees of the Department. 1. On 5/31/2024 LPA interviewed Administrator Diane McGill for the complaint dated 5/29/2024. During the interview LPA asked Administrator if she offered to cash a client's check(s) through her personal bank account and she denied it. However, during an interview with Program Director, he admitted that Administrator did offer to do this, as did the Reporting Party of the complaint. 2. On 7/29/2024 LPA interviewed a staff (S1) for the complaint dated 7/23/2024 regarding staff smoking in the presence of client(s). During the interview, the staff denied to LPA that staff smoked in front of the client, and did not admit that it was true until presented with photographic evidence. 3. On 8/13/2024 LPA Connie Goldie was present in the facility with the Department's Investigations Branch Investigator Austin Blatnik during an interview in which S1 denied that he was pulled over by police in the People's Care company vehicle. It was not until the investigator communicated with S1 that there was police report about it, that S1 admitted it was true.\n\nIn addition, for complaint dated 7/23/2024, LPA found that Administrator Diane McGill did not inform the Program Director that it was true that staff had been found smoking in front of a client, and on facility property when LPA presented Administrator with photographic evidence of such on 7/29/2024. On 8/13/2024 when LPA delivered those findings, Program Director informed LPA that Administrator did not inform him. As a result, the problem had not been addressed immediately as Administrator informed LPA it would be on 7/29/2024. On this date the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Section 84064(f)(4), and the California Health and Safety Code, Section 1558(a)(2) on the attached D-Page.

Confidential interviews denied lack of supervision resulted in C2 engaging in inappropriate interactions with C1 however, it was reported C2 walked into C1\u2019s room while S1 was in the living room and it was unclear if sexual interactions occurred due to C1 being non-verbal. Confidential interviews denied S1 failed to report suspected abuse in timely manner and stated S1 reported to S1\u2019s supervisor immediately when the incident occurred at 1:00am however, there are conflicting statements on whether the need to contact law enforcement for possible sexual abuse was delayed until the afternoon. Confidential interviews stated S1 did not witness C1\u2019s clothing tampered with however it was stated S1 found C2 in C1\u2019s bedroom without a shirt and C2\u2019s reasoning for being in C1\u2019s room was unclear. Confidential interviews stated conflicting statements regarding staff addressing C2's inappropriate behaviors and whether staff acted timely however S1 stated S1 re-directed C2, C2\u2019s room was changed and supervision was increased by adding 1:1 supervision staff including hallway staff monitoring for night supervision resulting from the incident. Other conflicting interview stated the facility should have provided increased supervision for C1 prior to the incident. Confidential interviews stated conflicting statements on whether the facility acted appropriately by waiting until the afternoon to take C1 to the hospital for medical attention, however it was stated there were no signs of abuse witnessed by S1 at the time of the incident and it was later recommended by law enforcement that C1 be taken to get medical attention. Confidential interviews stated a law enforcement report was made and C1 was seen by a medical professional however it was considered more traumatic for C1 to be evaluated for possible sexual abuse and was advised to be monitored by staff. Based on conflicting confidential interviews, the allegation that lack of supervision resulted in client#2 (C2) engaging in inappropriate interaction with client #1(C1), S1 did not report suspected abuse in timely manner, staff are not addressing resident's inappropriate behaviors, and facility did not obtain medical attention in a timely manner, however not supported or proven by evidence.

It was reported that the school contacted the facility multiple times to obtain a medication authorization form for clients to have medication stored and administered while at school. It was reported that C1 did not have clothes that fit and were too small. Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements. Confidential interviews revealed permission slips were sent to the facility on three dates and communication was not provided for C1 and C2 being able to attend a swimming field trip during Summer School, therefore, C1 and C2 did not attend the swimming field trip. Conflicting interviews revealed the permission slips were signed off; however, a staff name could not be verified, and it was revealed swim diapers were not found in C1 and C2\u2019s sizes, however, confidential interviews revealed other stores were not checked to see if swim diapers were in stock in C1 and C2\u2019s size. Regarding the allegation that facility staff does not respond to school request for information, confidential interviews revealed that the school requested authorization for C1 and C2\u2019s medication to be changed to 12:00pm, be stored, and administered at the school. Confidential interviews revealed emails and phone calls were made to the facility and the facility did not obtain the medication authorization form until school started in August 2022. Conflicting interviews revealed the school desired the medication to be changed and the physician\u2019s name and the number was provided to the school to communicate the medication changes and obtain authorization. Conflicting interviews and records revealed the school found C2\u2019s medication authorization form was previously signed and the facility obtained the medication authorization form for C1 that was signed by the physician two weeks after school started and the form was given to the school. Lastly, for the allegations that clients are not provided with adequate clothing, there is conflicting information. Confidential interviews revealed that clients receive monthly funds for clothing and incidentals. Confidential interviews reveal that staff completed a monthly inventory and purchased clothing and shoes, as needed for the clients. Conflicting interviews revealed observations that C1 and C2 appear to wear clothing that is too small for them. Records reviewed indicated C1 and C2 had clothing purchased in August 2022.

Record review disclosed video footage of C1 placed in a restraint in which C1 was observed to be face down with staff holding C1\u2019s hands behind their back.

On 6/17/2020, IB Investigator Barajas and Investigator Boyal conducted separate confidential interviews with the following: Attempted interviews with youths in care C1, C2, and C3. C1 and C2 were unresponsive to questions and C3 refused the interview. On 6/17/20, both investigators also interviewed Staff S1, S2, S3, S4, and S4. On 6/24/20, Investigator Barajas conducted separate interviews with a Registered Nurse (RN) and one physician (DR1). On 6/25/20, Investigator Barajas interviewed a second physician (DR2). On 7/14/20, Investigator Barajas interviewed one Service Coordinator (SC) from the Alta Regional Center and also conducted a separate interview with the Administrator (AD) of this facility Group Home. In interviews with physicians and a physician\u2019s representative, consistent statements were made that there was no issued order for the minor in care, C1, to wear or helmet. There was no concern regarding the level of care that C1 was receiving from the facility. In interviews with staff, S1 stated they had been present in the living room cleaning next to the couch where C1 was sitting on, when C1 fell. S1 stated C1 attempted to stand up and fell. S1 stated the fall was an accident but added that had they been closer to C1, they weren\u2019t sure if they could have stopped C1 in time from falling and injuring themselves. Staff S2 stated they were present in the facility but did not witness the event as they had been in another room cleaning. Upon hearing Staff S1 yell for help, S2 came out to the living room and observed that S1 had C1 in their arms. S1 placed C1 on the couch and S2 began to perform CPR until C1 regained consciousness. Confidential interviews with staff members were inconsistent in terms of whether the minor C1 was required to wear a helmet. One staff indicated that C1 only wears the helmet when displaying Serious Injurious Behavior and the last time C1 wore it was a week ago before this interview date. This same staff reported that the previous time C1 wore the helmet was about six months ago and according to C1\u2019s doctor a couple months back, C1 no longer needed to wear a helmet. A second staff stated that C1 will wear a helmet from time to time to protect their head but hasn\u2019t worn one since possibly May of 2019. This staff stated they were not aware of the policy on C1 having to wear a helmet but believes that a doctor ordered C1 to wear one. There was a third staff who stated C1 has a helmet they wear from time to time, but this staff was not sure if there was a written order on when C1 should wear the helmet. CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C\n\nBased on interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur.

The security guards and the hospital staff tried to de-escalate the client but C1 was out of control. The hospital staff brought out a gurney and admitted C1 to the hospital at 8:30 PM. Due to C1 being so assaultive and uncontrollable, the nurses administered an intramuscular shot with sedative medications to calm C1 down. The Administrator stayed with client during her stay while she recuperated and to see if the client was going to remain at the hospital and for support. The Doctor, however, discharged C1 from the hospital because C1 did not need to stay at the hospital any longer and was discharged at 10 PM.

The Administrator and nurse attempted to de-escalate C1 but she continued to be aggressive and assaultive. The nurses, Administrator and staff jointly put C1 in the facility van. The administrator sat in the van to transport (the care was not turned on) the client but C1 continued her aggression. The staff was sitting by client in the van also tried to de-escalate C1.

S1 stated that C2 missed 2 dental appointments and an additional court request had to be made as a result. S5 stated, \u201cAppointments were cancelled due to scheduling issues and lack of communication.\u201d Quarterly Review of IPP corroborates that there was a lapse in medical appointments for C1. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Regarding the allegation that documentation has not been provided, based on interview, IPP- Needs and Services Plan was not provided to authorized representative during the latter part of 2022 by previous administrator. 1 staff of 5 stated that documentation requested by authorized representatives is provided if requested but, could not provide verification. 4 of 5 staff were unaware if documentation was provided. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Regarding the allegation that incontinent needs are not being met, statements made by three of five staff corroborate that facility has run out of diapers for clients and a staff had to purchase at Walmart. 2 staff state the facility has not run out.

Regional Center staff stated they were aware of client running out of incontinent supplies and informed facility to use P and I to purchase diapers for the client. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Continued on LIC9099C\n\nRegarding the allegation that staff ratio is not being adhered to, 3 of 5 staff state that at times the facility is out of ratio. S3 stated facility was out of ratio two times a week. LPA verified by record review of schedules that the facility was out of ratio.

Additionally, on 03/07/2023, LPA observed only 2 staff present with four clients, 2 of which require 1:1 supervision. Based on LPAs observations and interviews which were conducted and record review(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. The facility is being cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5 Personal Rights 84072 (d) to receive medical care, Personal Rights 84702 (d) (4) Communication with authorized representative, 80077.4 (b) (8)Care for Clients with Incontinence 80077.4 (b) (8) and 84065.5 (c) Staff/ Child Ratios.

Two staff of five interviewed stated clients have mental health appointments but, documentation of the appointments was unable to be located by the facility. Three of five staff did not know how often clients had mental health appointments. Evidence provided does not support or disprove this allegation. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. Exit interview was conducted with name , title and a copy of this report along with appeal rights were discussed and provided to facility.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews were conducted with the Administrator, Lead Staff and seven staff members. Combined with reviewing time sheets against actual hours worked, it was discovered staff was at times not in proper ratio to cover two 1:1 clients in the home including 4/4/23 a.m. shift, 4/8/23 a.m. shift, and 4/14/23 a.m. shift. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that Staff do not provide adequate supervision to minors in care is substantiated meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The allegation states that Minor\u2019s medication records are not properly maintained by facility staff. Confidential interviews were conducted with the Administrator, Lead Staff and seven staff members. All staff interviewed confirmed that the medication key was kept unsecured in the staff office where an untrained staff or client could access it at any time to unlock the medication cabinet. A medication audit was conducted by LPA Roberts on 6/22/2023. During this audit, there were inconsistencies found on the client MARS including: a client medication being listed twice and therefore being double signed for, a discontinued medication remaining on the MAR and a medication listed with the wrong mg to be given. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that medication records are not properly maintained by facility staff is substantiated meaning that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6 Staff/Child Ratios 84065.5 (c) The facility was cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6 Health Related Services 80075 (k)(1) Diane McGill, administrator authorized Tazjinae Sims, DSP to sign in her absence. A copy of this report and appeal rights was left at the facility. End of report.\n\nConfidential interviews were conducted with the Reporting Party, Administrator, Lead Staff and seven staff members. Review of the facilities refrigerators, freezers, perishable and non-perishable foods, menus and grocery receipts were conducted. An interview was also conducted with Client #1. There was at least 3 days of perishable food and a week\u2019s worth of non-perishable food present on various unannounced visits conducted on 5/5/2023, 5/15/2023, 5/18/2023, 5/26/2023, 6/6/2023, 6/14/2023 and 6/22/2023 and the food in the home matched that noted on the menu for the week. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that Minors in care are not provided proper food service and that grocery shopping is delayed days at a time leaving the fridge and cabinets almost bare is unsubstantiated meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. The allegation states that staff are not properly trained and asked to sign for training that was not received. Confidential interviews were conducted with the Administrator, Lead Staff and seven staff members. Staff 1 through 7 reported that they were supervised and signed after training was completed. Staff #1-7 stated they were trained by multiple members of the management team. Staff 1 through 7 felt sufficiently trained for their roles. Review of training documents were conducted. Staff 1 through 7 had proper training documentation in employee files. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that staff are not properly trained is unsubstantiated meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. Diane McGill, Administrator, authorized Tazjinae Sims, DSP to sign in her absence. A copy of this report and appeal rights was left at the facility. End of report.",

It was acknowledged that Peoples Care Quality Assurance created and implemented a training program and have continued to conduct ongoing training as requested. Incident reporting has increased. The compliance for each location: People's Care Shawmutt, People's Care Kenneth, and People's Care Pleides was reviewed for the time period of May 2023- May 2024. The following current existing concerns were discussed: staffing to meet the needs of clients in care, not utilizing the emergency intervention plan as identified in facility's plan of operation when required and board accountability. Based on record reviews, the Shawmutt and Pleides locations have not had one complaint opened in the last 12 months and the citations issued have decreased. As a result, these locations will be removed from the non-compliance plan. The Kenneth location has had increased complaints and increased citations and will remain on the NCC for an additional six months. Increased oversight will remain in effect through 11/08/2024. Continued on LIC809C\n\nThe Department requests a revision of the Emergency Intervention plan be submitted within thirty days with clear directives on each of the different techniques and when they will be utilized along with the verification that staff have been trained on the use of the techniques outlined based on defined behaviors. An Administrator Exception Request needs to be submitted to the Department immediately. A copy of this report was provided via email to John O'Brien, District Manager for signature.",

    "narrative": "Allegations related to C1's medical condition and attending medical appointments include C1 has had and/or needed referral(s) to specialty medical services, including a pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) doctor, podiatry, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor, that the licensee/administrator has not scheduled and/or taken C1 to. In review of the documentation obtained, there are notes indicating that C1 was referred to GI specialty services due to an elevated lab report on 8/8/24, but this was not completed. LPA Hill interviewed the administrator about this on 10/31/24, and the administrator stated that this is no longer necessary, but was unable to provide proof or documentation attesting to this. As of the date of the writing of this document, C1 has not seen this specialist. This same documentation states that C1 was to return for a follow up \"in about 4 weeks\" but C1 did not see this doctor again until 11/27/24. When interviewed about missing appointments or needing to reschedule appointments, the administrator states that they do not document the change in appointments but \"it is written on the whiteboard\". C1's parent/guardian, school, and doctor's office have communicated various concerns including but not limited to C1 being excessively sleepy, weight gain, rectal bleeding, and elevated blood levels but the facility has no documentation about how these concerns were being addressed. The facility failed to provide documentation on what is being done to manage them. In the documentation obtained, it was noted that on 8/27/24, the school reported rectal bleeding when toileting, but there is no documentation indicating that C1 was taken to a hospital or doctor contacted as a result. Other documentation obtained indicates that C1 has \"gained almost 100 lbs since 3/2023\" but there is documentation about the facility reaching out to a doctor for further evaluations and/or referrals for medical professionals to assist the facility in managing this. The documentation shows that the facility was advised to increase C1's exercise in the facility, but there is no documentation that this has been done. As a result of the investigation including interviews conducted, documents reviewed, and information obtained, the allegations that staff do not address C1's change in medical condition and that staff do ensure a minor attends scheduled medical appointments are SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility is cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision as it relates to C1's medical condition, including weight gain, elevated blood levels, and/or bleeding, and medical appointments needed including to be seen by specialty doctors as prescribed by doctors when referrals are made and this not being completed or managed.\n\nThe allegation that staff are not ensuring C1 sleeps appropriately is related C1 being notably sleepy upon arrival at school and needing additional time in the mornings to sleep at school prior to engaging in the school programming. Interviews conducted with school personnel indicate that this was happening frequently but in review of documentation provided, it appears that there are notes indicating this was happening almost daily from 8/9/24 to 9/25/24. The facility's documentation notes that C1 was sleeping from 10 to 11 hours a day during this same time period without disruption. It is also noted that C1 had a medication change that could have contributed to the change(s) noted as well. There were no notes indicating that the noted sleepiness went beyond these dates provided during the investigation. As a result of the information obtained, documentation obtained, and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff are not ensuring C1 sleeps appropriately is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted and documents provided.",

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the Individual Service Plans, and quarterly assessments, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Latricia Rogers observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

Knives were in the closet under lock and key, but there was a pizza cutter that was not under lock and key, which was present with other non-sharp kitchen utensils. The first aid kit was reviewed and requires adhesive tape. The fire place was observed, but was not covered and/or inaccessible to clients in care. During an interview with the administrator, LPA Palmer was informed that it was a gas fire place and is always turned off. There were no paper towels in bathroom #1 or 2 to dry your hands after hand washing. Both medicine cabinets in both bathrooms appeared to have chipped paint and rust on the inside surface. LPA observed one client dry their hands using a towel from the cabinet outside of the bathroom and place it back into the cabinet for someone else to use. When LPA Palmer informed the administrator, he appeared to be okay with the process and stated the client was used to those procedures. LPA observed the 2nd sink in bathroom number 1 was not in good repair.\n\nBathroom 1 has chipping paint in the shower and bathroom 2 has a shower door that is in need of repair; as the door is hard to open and close and is coming off of the hinges and appears not to be secure at both the top and bottom hinges. Several windows do not have window screens. LPA Palmer observed the backyard. The outdoor backyard porch ceiling is chipping and appears to have plywood exposed. Per the administrator, the clients do not go in the backyard because clients can jump the fence, so instead they are taken to the park.

    "narrative": "This is an amended report to the report dated 7/28/2023. Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carrie Palmer conducted a Case Management - Annual Continuation visit to the above facility on 7/28/2023 at 11:00 AM for the purpose of conducting a required annual inspection. LPA met with Administrator, Arturo Gonzalez. There are 3 clients in care. Physical Plant (continued): Kitchen drawers are missing knobs, there is a hole in the wall of the counter top, no lid on the trash can and the freezer handle on the door is not in good repair. Operational Requirements (continued): The licensee was able to provide a schedule of indoor and outdoor activities to include karaoke and outings at the park. However, during and interview with the staff and the client, the scheduled of activities is not implemented often. Board meeting minutes were not provided by the licensee; as the staff reports the board meeting minutes are at the CEOs home office. Disaster Preparedness: Fire drills are being conducted once a month, but there was no Mass Casualty Plan of Action in place to ensure staff understand how to prepare, plan and practice keeping staff and clients safe in the event of an emergency or disaster. The administrator was able to provide individual treatment plans for every child, a medication list for all children in care and 3 sets of keys that shall be used in the event of an emergency. While the licensee was able to show the provisions of some training's, the licensee was unable to show that staff were being trained annually on disaster preparedness and therefore does not meet the training requirement.\n\nEmergency Intervention: Upon interviewing the administrator, LPA Palmer was informed that staff implement CPI only when children are a danger to themselves and others. However, the staff was unable to show a system in place to capture the restraint occurrence in the event staff would need to implement restraint methods. Staff Records: Upon the review of staff records and staff associations, it was determined that one staff was not associated with PTS 5, but was present and working at the facility on the day of the review. The staff was associated with PTS 1 and a transfer request was present in the staffs file, but was not processed. During the review of job descriptions, it was determined that the facility designated a House Manager to provide oversight. During an interview with the administrator, it was determined that the staff has been a House Manager for 6 months, and has worked with the company for approximately 3 years. There was no evidence of a job description in the staffs file and while the administrator states the staff was trained on how to be a House Manager, the Administrator was unable to provide evidence of the training. During an initial interview with the staff designated to be the House Manager, it was determined that she was unaware of her position. During a 2nd interview with the staff, the staff stated she was the House Manager. Staff was unable to provide transcripts for the House Manager to ensure qualifications were met to hold the position. No training on the understanding of a House Manager to the staff was presented during the review. All other job descriptions were present. Staff exemptions were reviewed. The facility has two administrators. One certification expires on 8/3/23 and the administrator is in the process of taking the class to renew the certification. The other certification expired in 2015. A renewal application has been submitted in March of 2023 and all renewal classes have been completed evidenced by a completion certificate. Educational backgrounds of administrators were reviewed. LPA was able to review the staff schedule. There was no position titles or days off listed. The Page 2 of 3 (Cont 809c)\n\nadministrator wrote in the position titles during the inspection. There were no performance evaluations for any staff at the facility. The staff stated that the performance evaluations are kept at the CEOs home office. During an observation with staff and clients, it was determined that effective communication was lacking and staff are in need of training. LPA recommends all staff and administrators be trained on how to communicate and listen to clients in care. Additionally, there was no evidence of training in the staff files regarding Care and Supervision to include communication, Early Signs of Illness and the Need for Professional Assistance, Availability of Community Services and Resources. There was no evidence of a written plan for facility managers. During and interview with the staff, some children see their doctors monthly and some children see their doctors quarterly. Children are required to meet with their doctors monthly; therefore staff will need to consult with the doctors and/or regional center to ensure compliance. Client Records: The needs and services plan does not have to be completed by the facility social worker or administrator since children are placed by the regional center. Staff Interviews: LPA was able to interview 2 staff. During the interview, it was determined that some staff were familiar with reporting in the case of child abuse or neglect, but may need training on emergency preparedness. Client interviews: LPA was able to interview one client. The client stated he was very happy with the program. And is excited about his upcoming day program. The client was able to explain the phone policy and expressed that the staff understands him and his needs. LPA was unable to interview the other clients; as they were non-verbal. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of the LIC 809, 809C, 809Ds was provided to the facility representative.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that C1 suffered a bruise on the right thigh due to neglect and lack of supervision by the facility staff. S1, S2, and S3 denied the alleged allegation further indicating that there are two to three staff members present at the facility depending on the needs of the facility. Staff further indicated that one of the staff works one on one with C1 while the other staff member supervises the other two clients. S3 indicated that on October 16, 2022, while getting C1 ready for school no marks or bruising was observed on C1\u2019s body, and therefore a body check chart was not completed. Information obtained from S1 indicated while helping C1 off the school bus she was informed by the bus driver (name not known) that three staff members needed to help get C1 on the bus due to C1 continuously dropping to the floor. S1 indicated that no marks were observed due to the type of clothing that C1 was wearing at the time C1 was dropped off from school. S1 further disclosed that two to three hours later while assisting C1 with their hygiene needs she observed a bruise greenish/blueish in color the size of an adult\u2019s closed fist and immediately reported it to the facility Administrator (S2). S2 indicated that once she received the call and observed the bruise S2 advised S1 to get C1 ready to transport C1 to Urgent Care to be further medically evaluated for any internal injuries. S2 indicated that X-rays were taken of C1\u2019s right hip and no signs of internal injuries. S2 indicated that a SIR was completed and all the appropriate agencies were notified in a timely manner. Information obtained from the Kern County Regional case worker TC, revealed that C1 has been diagnosed with anemia and therefore will bruise easily. TC indicated that C1 also has a habit of hitting herself in the hip area with the base of the palm which has also caused bruising in the past just not as severe. Furthermore, C1\u2019s support team has approved for C1 to wear protective pants and a padded vest (both non-restrictive) to help protect C1 and reduce future injuries. In addition to protective clothing, C1\u2019s school has agreed to keep a daily log of C1\u2019s behavior and communicate with the facility and the Regional Center to help deter some of the self-harming behaviors. TC further indicated that the Regional Center staff found no wrongdoing by the facility staff and indicated that the staff has done an exceptional job providing care for C1 and being in communication with C1\u2019s support team. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Facility Administrator. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the Facility Administrator.",

FC1 is legally blind and child\u2019s hearing may be impaired as well. FC1 is a non-ambulatory child. Also, FC1 is not toilet trained and requires full assistance with toileting and wears diapers. Staff 1 stated that FC1 has very sensitive skin and bruises easily. S1 stated that FC1 wears pull up diapers and is changed every hour and a half or sooner depending on the amount of liquids consumed. S1 stated that FC1 rides the school bus to and from the facility and tthe ride is approximately 30 minutes long. During the bus ride FC1 must wear a harness for protection that covers his upper body. S1 stated that diaper rashes are common due to child\u2019s sensitive skin. Also, FC1 likes to ride and sit on small toys. S1 and S2 have witnessed FC1 on top of small toys and this causes bruising on the child\u2019s body. S1 and S2 redirect FC1 when child is on top of any small toy to prevent further bruising on the child\u2019s body. Due to FC1 being diagnosed with autism and blindness child is easily injured or bruised. S1 and S2 keep a daily log of the child\u2019s bruises, clusters, rashes or any other mark on the child\u2019s body (Continuous Notes & Body Chart 12/02/21). S1 stated that on 12/02/21 it was disclosed to the child\u2019s school via a note about the bruising near the anus and the diaper rash so that ointments can be applied to FC1 at school. S1 and S2 stated that due to the long bus ride and protective harness, FC1 is prone to bruising and diaper rashes. S1 and S2 stated that FC1 has returned from school with a soiled diaper and even a diaper rash. S1 and S2 do their best at maintaining the school informed of any accidental bruising or diaper rashes. LPA interviewed Director and stated that the staff sends notes to school regarding any bruising or rashes to the child\u2019s body. This is a common practice and the staff keeps a log of this information as well. LPA attempted to interview FC1, FC2 and FC3 but was unable because all three children are non-verbal. LPA observed the facility clean and the children seemed comfortable around the staff. After reviewing medical records, FC1 is prone to accidental bruising due to blindness, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Other interviews didn\u2019t provide any information regarding this allegation. For the allegation regarding the youth accessing to dangerous objects, a confidential statement indicated that the youth accessed a scissor during C1\u2019s visitation at C1\u2019s biological parents\u2019 home. GH staff was not unable to find or locate the scissor until C1 cut his hair in the GHs\u2019 bathroom. A confidential witness reported that the incident was immediately reported to them and they returned to GH to get the scissors back. The confidential witness stated that C1 got the scissors at C1\u2019s sibling\u2019s room while visiting. A plan was established to ensure C1 will not access any sharp objects while visiting with biological parents. Other interviews stipulated that all sharp objects including razors were always locked at the group home and C1 had attempted to access razors. Based on interviews conducted, the allegations that the facility staff were not properly supervising C1 and C1 had access to dangerous objects may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were emailed to Jerry Parchejo for original signature. Original signed report will be placed in facility file.",
