The purpose of the inspection was to deliver the findings for the above complaint allegation. During Investigation, confidential interviews were conducted, and incident reports reveal that C1 (Please refer to LIC811) had a rash near his genital area. Maxim staff who is employed as a third party at the facility, first noticed the rash and notified C1\u2019s mom and the S1. C1\u2019s mom notified S1 that she will be scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and asked for the facilities availability. S1 suggested that 6/24/22 would be a good day to take C1 for the appointment. S1 did not hear back until 6/28/22 when C1\u2019s mom called S1 and explained that he had a conversation with the Doctor regarding the injury near the genital rash and sent a photo to the Doctor. The Doctor advised C1's mom to put Vaseline. C1's mom said that Vaseline might irritate C1 more. On that same day, a nurse consultant came to the facility to assess the rash. The nurse consultant instructed staff to keep doing body checks and to put Vaseline on the rash. C1\u2019s mom told S1 that there is no need for the appointment and to notify her if it happens again so C1\u2019s mom can decide if an appointment should be made. During confidential interviews, all parties deny seeing all four clients in the bathroom together. The facility allows clients to independently walk around in the facility. If clients are fighting or get too close, staff will redirect them immediately. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that facility staff did not seek client medical attention and facility staff are not adequately supervising clients, therefore the above allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy was sent to Irene Lakandula, Administrator.",

Minor adjusted the thermostat anyway and became verbally and physically aggressive to staff. Staff redirected minor and denied engaging in a physical altercation. Staff denied causing any injury to minor. Minor then went to the kitchen, took some juice and went back to the bedroom. Staff reminded minor that juice is not allowed that late but offered minor water instead, which minor declined.

FA further reported that the staff was counseled on the correct procedure but was not willing to comply with corrective action plan and was not receptive to additional training. This led to the facility management team deciding to terminate S1\u2019s employment with the facility effective 3/2/23. LPA requested a copy of the medication administration policy and asked about procedures for staff to ensure accuracy of med distribution. FA reviewed policy and acknowledged that S1 did not follow policy and procedure.

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed on Friday, February 3, 2023, school personnel notified facility staff of Client #1\u2019s (C1) illness symptoms and advised that C1 be picked up to be sent home. Statements revealed that although facility staff members were aware C1 was ill since February 3, 2023, when notified by the school, the facility staff neither obtained medical attention for C1 nor kept C1 home from school on the following Monday, February 6, 2023. On Monday February 6, 2023, C1 was sent to school and observed appearing in worse condition than the prior Friday. School personnel again called the facility to pick up C1 due to illness. On the morning of February 7, 2023, C1 was discovered by staff, laying on the floor in their room. C1 was transported to the hospital by ambulance from the facility with confusion and shortness of breath. C1 was placed into intensive care and intubated in critical health. C1\u2019s condition continued to de-escalate over time and on March 1, 2023, C1 succumbed to death due to medical complications. During the week proceeding C1\u2019s hospitalization, C1 had been observed exhibiting symptoms of not feeling well while at school. Documentary evidence determined that C1 died from illnesses that were contracted while in the care of the facility. Based on confidential interviews, review of documentary evidence and medical reports, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The Department has determined substantiated findings that staff did not provide medical attention in a timely manner contributed to C1\u2019s death. This poses an immediate health, safety, and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. The facility is issued a citation in accordance with the California Department of Regulations, Title 22 Chapter 5, Division 6, 84078(b) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and 84064(f)(4) Administrator Qualifications. The Department has concluded an analysis and determined that an enhanced civil penalty of $7,500 is warranted under Health and Safety Code 1548(e). The Department has issued an immediate Civil Penalty Assessment of $7,500.

It was reported that, on 12/27/21, at 3:20 PM, a disabled client (C1), slipped and fell due to spilled water on the kitchen laminate floor. C1 had escalated. C1 then stood up and limped to their room. Staff checked on C1 after they went to bed. At that time, C1 got out of bed, and continued limping more on their left leg. C1 was given Acetaminophen for soreness and they slept through the night. The client is non-verbal. In the morning, 12/28/21, C1 would not get out of bed and would scream when staff prompted them to. 911 was then called, and an ambulance transported C1 to Mercy Medical Center in Redding, Ca, where it was discovered C1 had broken their hip. C1 was flown to UC Davis in Sacramento, Ca for surgery. C.M. told LPA a nine hour surgery was performed on client's hip at UC Davis, on 12/29/21 . The client had a pre-existing condition with tendons in his feet, which was diagnosed during placement at the facility. This condition caused him to walk on his tip-toes. C.M. will be providing documentation of pre-existing condition, of hip injury from Mercy, and of hip surgery from UC Davis. LPA conducted interviews with the two staff members present during the incident, as well as a Supervisor who met the client at the hospital. There are no citations being given at this time.

The address is 3191 Churn Creek Rd. Redding CA, 96002. LPA investigated the incident-conducted interviews with three staff members, in addition to Facility Program Manager (C.M.). The two staff members, S1 and S2, present at the time of the incident, stated C1 was initially limping after falling and hurting his hip, and that the limp progressively worsened throughout the evening. S1 and S2 stated they had to lift C1 to help him to his room after dinner. The two staff told LPA they intended to take C1 to the doctor in the morning, which they shared with S3, the night staff member, when he arrived. S3 told LPA that C1 was whaling in pain all night long and that S3 did not call 911 because S1 and S2 had told him not to when they debriefed S3. S1 and S2 told LPA they did not seek emergency medical attention because they hoped C1 had only bruised his hip. The three staff told LPA that C1 could not get out of bed in the morning and that C1 was covered in feces and urine. Based on staff neglecting to seek emergency medical attention for a non-verbal client displaying signs of pain for fourteen hours due to an injury resulting in multiple surgeries, LPA is citing facility for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division and Chapter Six Interim Licensing Standards 80075 Health Related Services: (a) The licensee shall ensure that each client receives necessary first aid and other needed medical or dental service services, including arrangement for and/or provision of transportation to the nearest available.

Menus and grocery lists were detailed, containing nutritious meals for the clients. LPM observed snacks left out for clients that had not been finished, by the client\u2019s own choosing. Interviews were consistent that one client had a diagnosis of PICA, which means the client tends to eat items off the ground or out of the garbage. Interviews indicate this behavior rarely exists at the facility, with the high level of supervision provided, but the behavior is more evident at the school. Interviews were consistent that the clients do not require diapers during the day, but do use diapers or Pull-Ups at night. Facility staff report consistently cleaning the clients when a toileting accident occurs. There was insufficient evidence to determine if the client\u2019s diapers are not changed timely. Based on LPM and LPA\u2019s observations, interviews conducted, and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur.

    "narrative": "An allegation was made that a staff hit a minor in care, based on the minor\u2019s behavior and verbalizations. Interviews and records reviewed were consistent that a staff spanked a minor four times with a wooden spatula on 11/02/24. The facility submitted a 24-hour Incident Report (IR) on 11/02/24, indicating inappropriate discipline (spanking) by the staff, which was witnessed by two other staff. The staff who spanked the minor was suspended from work the same day and terminated from employment on 11/06/24. The facility arranged for the remaining staff to attend a training on 11/13/24 to review Professional Boundaries and Appropriate Crisis Intervention. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. One citation is being issued due to violating Title 22, Division 6, Section 84072 (d)(19). A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and LIC-9099D were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted. Appeal rights were provided.\n\nDuring interviews and records reviewed, it was reported that a minor in care sustained an unexplained injury. One service provider reported that the minor had a scratch on their torso. Three staff reported the minor sustained an injury while playing with a plunger in the shower, causing a circular bruise on their chest. The bruise from the plunger occurred on 10/12/24 and an internal incident report was documented. The scratch was reported within two days, 10/24/24 of the incident. There was conflicting information in the interviews regarding whether the injury was a scratch or bruise. Based on verbalizations by the minor containing swear words, it was alleged that staff speak to the minor in an inappropriate manner, and the minor learned the words from staff. The minor was unable to report what exactly staff said to them. When interviewed, all staff reported that they do not use inappropriate or foul language with the clients. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegations may have happened, or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violations did, or did not, occur.

    "narrative": "Interviews were consistent regarding the allegation, Minor sustained unexplained injuries while in care. 10 out of 10 staff interviewed all reported that a minor was playing on a hammock, which broke, causing the minor to fall, resulting in a scratch on the back. All interviewed reported that they did not witness the fall and only assumed the scratch on the minor was from the fall. An internal incident report was documented regarding the scratch on the minor\u2019s back, but it was not submitted to the Department . No staff were present to supervise the minor outside at the time of the reported fall and injury. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. One citation is being issued for violating Interim Licensing Standards version 6, 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (a)The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and LIC 9099D and appeal rights were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.\n\nOn or about 3/16/2025, one minor was complaining about an injury on their backside. All staff interviews believed the injury was from a fall off a hammock. However, there were no witnesses to the fall. Two confidential interviews reported the minors were speaking inappropriately, leading to concerns of sexually inappropriate behavior within the facility. Staff Interviews were consistent that they do not speak to the minors inappropriately. Facility records indicated one minor learned inappropriate words from a family member on the phone and has been repeating the words within the facility, leading other minors to also use the words. The minor was unable to report what exactly the family member said to them. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.",

The facility manager (FM) reiterated AD\u2019s statement and added that she helped S1 clean the cut and applied a first aid bandage in which C1 removed the bandage immediately. S1 stated that she met AD and C1 at the door and she noticed that C1\u2019s foot was bleeding and looked fresh, therefore, she cleaned and applied bandage. Other confidential interviews didn\u2019t witness the incident. For the allegation that staff refused to seek appropriate medical attention, the AD expressed that applying first aid treatment was appropriate at that time. AD denied that the facility refused to seek medical attention. AD mentioned that she took C1 to the doctor when it was reported that C1\u2019s foot was infected. AD added that the doctor ruled out an infection and recommended to keep the injury clean and dry. S1 stated that the cut was not deep and when she cleaned the injury, the bleeding stopped. S1 stated that applying first aid was appropriate and it was not necessary to take C1 to urgent care. S1 reported that C1 was continuously picking at the injury making it difficult to heal. S1 mentioned that she worked during the weekend, and she was unable to keep C1 from picking at the injury. A confidential interview stated they observed C1 picking at the injury and that might have contributed to the injury looking unpleasant. The out of home investigator (OHI) believed that C1 should have been treated by a medical professional. For the allegation regarding facility was not providing adequate hygiene supplies, AD indicated that this was a lie and she was sending three to four diapers to school daily. The AD stated that she added the extra diapers due to having a feedback from C1\u2019s teacher. The AD denied that the facility was not providing adequate hygiene supplies. FM stated that she also went to drop off additional hygiene supplies to the school to ensure that C1 had sufficient daily hygiene supplies. LPA verified that the GH had a stock of hygiene supplies for all residents. Based on the confidential interviews, the Department determined there was not a sufficient information to determine if C1\u2019s injury was unexplained, staff refused to seek appropriate medical attention for C1 and facility did not provide C1 with adequate hygiene supplies. Although the allegations may have happened or may be valid, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the allegation. The Department\u2019s finding is that these allegations were unsubstantiated.",

AD stated that she held C1\u2019s hand to escort C1 to the GH where the staff (S1) observed that C1\u2019s toe was bleeding, and they immediately cleaned with alcohol and wrapped it.",

Confidential interviews also revealed that client did not remember when they were hit but that the hit hurt. Confidential interviews also revealed that bruises were visible but could have come from injections while in the hospital or client being self-injurious. It was also revealed during confidential interviews that there are no other complaints of staff hitting clients. During interviews A2 revealed that C1 disclosed that C1 was being physically abused by staff. It was also revealed during interviews with A2 that C1 reported that staff at the group home hit C1 in the back. LPA Rogers also learned during interviews with A2 that C1 had visited the hospital on numerous occasions and injuries were visible. During interviews with staff it was revealed that C1 would do self-harm to themselves if requests to speak to mother were denied. It was also revealed from interviews with staff that C1 would often AWOL from the facility and injure themselves by laying in the middle of the street and bang their head on the concrete. It was also revealed from staff that the facility is a hands-off facility and staff would often verbally redirect C1 when becoming elevated. It was revealed during interviews with A1 that C1 has had a hard time adjusting to living in the facility. A1 also revealed during interviews that C1 has been in the hospital for numerous 5150 holds. A1 also revealed that C1 has had bruises on C1\u2019s back and arms but attributes the bruises from injections at the hospital. A1 also revealed to LPA Rogers that C1 has lied numerous occasions and elaborates on stories to make them more believable. ADM revealed during interviews there is no discipline policy used at the facility and that clients are redirected when needed. ADM also revealed that local police have had to be called for C1 on numerous occasions. ADM also revealed that C1 sustained several bruises to C1 head and arms while banging their head in the street and on bedroom walls. ADM also revealed that C1 had been placed on numerous 5150 holds since placement into the facility. ADM revealed to LPA Rogers that C1 would do daily harm to themselves and would accelerate in harmful behaviors until they got their way. Based on interviews, the allegation that staff hit C1 on back while in care, may have occurred, however, is not supported by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted via video conference and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights will be emailed to Lena Rush, Administrator for signature.

    "narrative": "During the course of this investigation, LPA Xiong conducted confidential interviews with four staff S1-S4, one client (Y2), and the CEO/Administrator (CA). LPA reviewed Medication Administration Records and facility documents for New Employee Orientation and the Onboarding/ New Hire Training Checklist. In reviewing the Medication Record for one client (Y1), LPA noted a total of seven dates/times where there were no initials indicating medication was administered nor any indications of why medication was not administered. These seven dates/times were highlighted but no documentation was found for the highlights and blank spots. During confidential staff interviews, Staff S1 and S4 made consistent statements that highlights are done to indicate where staff had forgotten to initial or fill out when administering medications. Based on records reviewed and interviews conducted, the allegation that Medications are not properly documented is found to be Substantiated. During confidential staff interviews, three out of the four staff made consistent statements that CPR/First Aide training certificates had expired, and the facility was not providing training. One out of the four staff stated that due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the facility has had trouble scheduling training for all employees but is currently in the process of ensuring all staff is up to date with required training. In obtaining copies of staff training logs on 09/22/20, LPA observed that all staff members had current and up to date CPR/First Aid certificates that were completed during the dates of September 15, 2020 \u2013 September 28, 2020. CPR/First Aid training was not provided and completed until after the complaint allegations were received. Based on records reviewed and interviews conducted, the allegation that Staff are not CPR certified is found to be Substantiated. Three out of the four staff interviewed made consistent statements that medication training for new employees is done verbally through job shadowing of whichever staff is scheduled for that day. Two Staff made consistent statements that there is no formal written procedure to follow when administering medications. One staff stated that the facility ensures staff are trained in Medication Administration by using the employee \u201cOnboarding\u201d checklist. In reviewing the copy of an \u201cOnboarding/New Hire Training Checklist\u201d sent in by the facility, LPA did not observe any topics listed on the form pertaining to Medication or Medication Administration. Based on records reviewed and interviews conducted, the allegation that Staff are not properly trained is found to be Substantiated.

Exit interview conducted. A copy of this report along with Appeal Rights was emailed to the CEO/Administrator, Krista Fiser.\n\nDuring the course of this investigation, LPA Xiong conducted confidential interviews with four staff S1-S4, one client (Y2), and the CEO/Administrator (CA). LPA also reviewed Medication Administration Records and facility documents for New Employee Orientation and the Onboarding/ New Hire Training Checklist. LPA investigated the allegation that Medications are not administered properly. During confidential interviews with staff, one staff stated that medications are administered properly but that some staff are not documenting correctly and are lacking in training. A second staff stated it is all staff\u2019s responsibility to review all client\u2019s intake forms daily or on a regular basis to know which client takes medication and the medication being administered. A third staff stated their training included documenting on the Client\u2019s MAR, making sure it\u2019s the right medication, the right date, the right time, and the right dose being given. This third staff shared that there was a prior incident in which a staff gave a client two pills/dose but client only took one. However, due to no disclosure of names for client and staff involved, LPA was unable to verify this incident. In a confidential interview with client (Y2), they stated that they thought staff were properly trained. Y2 stated they took medication during their stay at the facility and staff would remind Y2 when it was time for their medications and ensure that Y2 swallowed their medications. However, Y2 could not recall all the steps staff took in administering medication, including if staff documented the administration of medications. LPA also investigated the allegations that Staff serving foods that are not nutritional and Staff serving expired food to minors. During a confidential interview with Staff S1, they stated that they considered most meals served to be nutritional as there are always fruits or veggies to choose from. Staff S1 denied that expired food is being served in the facility and stated that food being served \u201calways looks good and tasty.\u201d Staff S4 stated that food was not nutritional, giving the example of tortilla chips being served with processed cheese. S4 also stated that there were times staff would go to cook meals, but the meat would be expired, having a rancid smell. Staff S3 staff stated that the facility provides meals that are inadequate as children are still hungry. CONTINUED ON LIC9099-C\n\nWhen asked by LPA if clients have access to snacks or food in the facility if they are still hungry, S3 stated they should have access but is unsure if clients do. When asked by LPA if staff had the option to cook additional meals or food items for clients in care when hungry, S3 stated they did not know. Staff S3 stated they have observed bread or breakfast buns in the facility with expired dates. When asked by LPA if these items were served to clients, this second staff stated no, but that these food items were placed in the open where clients could have access. During an interview, Client Y2 stated that they liked the food being served at the facility and denied seeing food being served that was moldy or expired. When asked for example of food items Y2 ate or that Y2 observed being served at the facility, they named Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, and Green Beans. Y2 also stated there were fruits and vegetables such as apples and carrots. During a physical inspection of the facility, LPA observed both perishable and non-perishable food items that were not past it\u2019s expiration or best use by date. LPA also observed fresh fruits, vegetables, and a snack bowl that was accessible to clients in care. Based on LPA\u2019s observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that a facility staff did not seek medical attention for a facility client. The investigation revealed several occasions whereby a facility staff, Reference #1, failed to seek medical attention for a client. On one occasion, a facility client sustained a laceration to the back of her head while she was in the bathroom. Reference #1 stated that the client asked him for food while she was in the bathroom and when he declined, he heard a loud thud. Reference #1 checked on the client in bathroom, but he did not check her for any injuries. Reference #1 stated that he did not notice any blood in the bathroom. Reference #1 stated that the client cried for about 10 seconds then went to bed. Another staff member who relieved Reference #1\u2019s shift observed a lump and a cut on the client\u2019s head and took FC to the hospital. On another occasion, Reference #1 accidentally struck the facility client on the head when he slipped on her urine. The facility client was sitting on the floor by the urine when she was struck by Reference #1 as he slipped. Reference #1 stated that he did not seek medical attention for the client even though the incident left a shoe print on the client\u2019s head. On another occasion, the client also complained of having teeth and foot pains to Reference #1. Reference #1 admitted that the client complained of pain, but he did not seek medical attention for her as he attributed her complaints as part of her behavior. Based on the information gathered, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was met, therefore the allegation is substantiated per California Code of Regulations Title 22 \u2013 refer to LIC9099-D for deficiencies. Per the new Civil Penalty laws, Health and Safety (H&S) Code section 1548(d), a civil penalty determination is pending due to the substantiated allegation concerning the injury sustained by the facility client. A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form, LIC 9099-D for deficiency and Appeal Rights were provided to the agency representative.\n\nIt was alleged that a facility client sustained a broken finger caused by a staff, two facility staff pulled a facility client's hair, facility staff pushed a facility client, and facility staff neglected a facility client's toileting needs. The investigation revealed the following: With regards to the allegation of the facility client sustaining a broken finger caused by a facility staff, the facility client provided inconsistent statements on who caused the injury to her as information was obtained whereby the client indicated that a specific staff caused her injury, but that staff was on vacation at the time the injury was found. The client was taken to receive medical attention once staff observed the injury, and it is unclear how the client sustained the injury. With regards to the allegation of two facility staff pulled a facility client's hair, both of the staff who allegedly pulled the facility client's hair denied the allegation. There were no witnesses to the allegation, and the facility client refused to provide a statement to Investigator Lomeli regarding the incident. With regards to the allegation of facility staff pushed a facility client, the staff who allegedly pushed the facility client denied the allegation. Another staff who allegedly witnessed the incident denied the allegation. With regards to the allegation of facility staff neglecting a facility client's toileting needs, statements obtained from facility staff denied the allegation and none of the staff interviewed has ever witnessed other staff neglecting the toileting needs of clients at the facility. Based on the information gathered, although the allegations may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations was not met, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form and Appeal Rights were provided to the facility representative.",

Staff denied having hazardous items accessible to clients further indicating that all chemicals were stored in a locked cabinet in the garage. Staff denied the facility being in disrepair and further indicating that when items were damaged by clients said items would be discarded and replaced by upper management. As to the allegations of staff not meeting minors\u2019 dietary needs and staff storing expired food, staff indicated that meals plans were followed, however C2 refused the meals and would have a tantrum until C2 was given what they wanted. Staff indicated that the facility had plenty of perishable and non-perishable foods that would be purchased on a weekly basis. Staff indicated that they would periodically go through the food and discard the expired items. As to the allegations of clients bedding being unsanitary and not providing clients adequate bedding, staff stated that the facility had an ample amount of bedding and were continuously doing laundry due to client\u2019s medical issues. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated.

The facility had a staffing shortage that night with another facility requiring the staff scheduled to be at this facility to cover for another staff who did not show up and did not notify facility management. The facility provided an additional worker at this facility during this incident to cover for the staff shortage. The facility also implemented disciplinary actions for the facility staff and provided re-training regarding proper staffing ratios, consumer rights and emergency contact protocols.

A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form, LIC 9099-D for deficiency and Appeal Rights were provided to the agency representative.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the two clients at the facility played with a water hose in the backyard resulting in the clients being drenched with water. It was alleged that staff forced clients to undress due to their clothes being wet and entering the facility. Confidential statements obtained during the investigation were unable to corroborate the allegations as details obtained provided inconsistencies which did not support the allegations. One facility client who allegedly undressed in front of the staff stated that they did not change their clothes in front of staff but instead changed their clothes in the bathroom once staff provided them with a bath towel. The other facility client insisted that the other client changed their clothes in front of the staff. Confidential statements obtained regarding staff providing inadequate meals were also inconsistent as one client indicated that food was always readily available and accessible while another client maintained that staff did not provide him with a meal upon request. Facility staff denied the allegations altogether stating that they did not require the clients to change their clothes in their presence and denied withholding meals to the clients. Other facility staff denied witnessing other staff neglect providing meals to clients. In addition, the facility was stocked with food and snacks during an unannounced facility inspection.

The purpose of the inspection is to follow-up Emergency Response Referral Information as well as Special Incident Report (SIR) received by the Department on 09/17/2024 that triggered Emergency Response Referral. The incident was not processed as a complaint, therefore LPA is conducting a case management. The SIR indicated on 09/14/2024 S1 received a call from S2 that C1 was exhibiting aggressive behavior due to leaving her toy behind at the family visit and after multiple verbal redirection were unsuccessful, S3 and S2 implemented a CPI support hold. After a few minutes C1 attempted to pull S3 hair, scratch and spit on her. While S2 was trying to remind C1 she will be able to pick the toys she had left at the family visit if she calms down, S3 took C1 to her room and threw her on the bed. S2 was monitoring C1 during the rest of the S2 shift and C1 appeared to be in good health and took a nap. LPA requested to review staff Personal Rights, Preventing abuse and CPI training. LPA reviewed the training.

    "narrative": "An allegation has been made regarding the staff's failure to supervise clients adequately at the STRTP mentioned previously. These allegations claim that as a result, one of the clients suffered unexplained injuries. The staff members, S1 and S2, involved in the incident have denied the allegations, and they have stated that they adhere to the Interim Licensing standards, which maintain a staff-to-client ratio of 1:4. However, S2 reported an incident on the morning of January 19, 2024, around 2:00 AM. S2 heard a commotion coming from one of the client's (C2) bedrooms and found two clients (C1 and C2) lying in the same bed with an iPad next to them. S2 removed the iPad, and no further issues occurred. S2 reported that later that morning while getting C1 and C2 ready for school, S2 noticed some superficial scratches on C1's cheek, ear, and hand. S2 recorded what they observed in C1's behavior log and informed the facility administrator about it. Both clients have a history of scratching and picking at their skin when frustrated or worried. This could have made the scratches on C1 stand out more while at school, according to staff. The CSW and the Paternal Grandmother provided information that the siblings tend to kick, scratch, and bite each other over toys or when feeling frustrated since they are non-verbal. Additionally, it was revealed that C1 has a habit of picking at scabs or skin when nervous or in a new environment such as the case with the subject facility. Both the CWS and Paternal Grandmother confirmed that they have no issue with the care and supervision provided by the staff to the children. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Foster Family Agency. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time.

The investigation included confidential interviews that consisted of, but were not limited to: Administrator and client (see Confidential Names, LIC 811 Ref. #1 dated August 4, 2021) at the facility on July 22, 2021. Client Ref. #2 declined to be interviewed. The LPA was unable to interview Staff Ref. #3, because Ref. #3 resigned as of July 3, 2021 and moved out of state. The LPA reviewed Needs and Services Plans, and facility Status Change Form including a Resignation Letter. The investigation revealed that Ref. #1 admitted to attempting to discipline Ref. #3. Based upon statements Ref. #3 told Ref. #1 to stop and get off of Ref. #2. The LPA was unable to corroborate the statement. The investigation revealed that there is no documentation regarding a physical incident between Ref. #1 and #2. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that an alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding these allegations. A copy of this complaint was provided to Ms. Jones.",

Remote \"tele-inspection\" of facilities is a part of Community Care Licensing Division\u2019s emergency response to the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). LPA spoke with Ty Scherer, Facility Administrator. The purpose of the tele-inspection was to follow up on an unusual incident that occurred on January 23, 2021 involving C1. On January 25, 2021, the facility submitted a Special Incident Report (SIR) to the Department reporting that on January 23, 2021, C1 died from choking on food at the facility. The facility reported that on January 23, 2021 at approximately 1:42 PM, C1's one-on-one staff (S1) exited the restroom and observed C1 on the floor unresponsive in the facility office/den. S1 also observed food coming out of C1's mouth. S1 immediately contacted 911 and performed chest compressions on C1 as instructed by the dispatcher. Bakersfield Fire Department, Bakersfield Police Department and Hall Ambulance Service arrived within minutes. Paramedics took over and performed CPR on the resident. C1 was then taken by ambulance to Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield. On January 23, 2021 at approximately 3:00 PM, the Administrator was notified by C1's father that C1 passed away. During the tele-inspection, LPA conducted a virtual tour of the facility, interviewed Mr. Scherer and requested the following records: facility sketch; client roster; staff roster or LIC 500; food menu (last week); C1's most current IPP/Needs and Services Plan; C1's diagnosis; C1's medication log for the month of January; any related incident reports; C1's clothing and property inventory.

Client was agitated at the time and was running and yelling inside the facility. Client attempted to grab some items from a drawer but struggled. As client pulled the drawer with force, part of it came off and struck client in the face. It was noted that client sustained redness and bruising by the eye area, but client refused to allow staff to apply first aid. LPA followed up on first aid refusal by client with staff. Staff explained that whenever client refuses first aid, client is closely monitored and taken to Urgent Care or ER, if needed. Staff do not recall client needing medical care after the incident. Based on information obtained, there is insufficient evidence found to support the allegation, so the allegation is unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names Form and Appeal Rights forms were provided to the facility representative at the conclusion of the tele inspection.\n\nClothing and bed linens were in disarray in one client\u2019s bedroom and the extra bedroom. No bath linens were observed. LPA observed almost empty containers of shampoo, body wash and other hygiene items in two plastic organizer caddies. There were no additional hygiene products observed. Based on the above information, there is sufficient evidence found so the allegations are substantiated. LPA discussed the finding of the allegations and a plan of correction with the facility representative.

Facility staff were aware of the requirements of proper care for the client, including one on one supervision. Based on this evidence, the complaint was substantiated, and the facility was cited on 9/8/21 under California Code of Regulations 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and supervision. continued\n\nThe Department has concluded an analysis and determined that an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) is warranted.

Confidential interview indicated C1 was new to the facility and went out of area with S1 following. According to confidential interview, C1 and S1 walked a couple blocks from the facility, and S1 didn\u2019t intervene due to C1 not showing unsafe behaviors. Confidential interview indicated C1 crossed in the middle of the street and was advised by S1 to use a crosswalk next time. Confidential interview indicated S2 and S3 arrived for support and took over to process with C1.

Confidential interview indicated S1 engaged in an unapproved one person hold by grabbing C1 by the collar of C1\u2019s shirt and walking C1 backwards onto the sidewalk. Confidential interview indicated C1 became aggressive towards S1, and, in an effort to keep C1 safe, S1 bent over and picked up one of C1\u2019s legs causing C1 to fall on the ground and S1 to fall as well. Confidential interview indicated S1 locked legs with C1 while on the ground, and S1 held on to C1 by one of their ankles, to prevent C1 from running into oncoming traffic, until law enforcement arrived.

Confidential interviews indicated that C1 jumped down from the gate and began to make homicidal statements and lunged toward staff. Confidential interview indicated staff initially attempted to put C1 in a two-person hold, during which C1 was kicking their legs and pushing back. Confidential interview indicated that staff subsequently initiated several other restraint techniques, including two-arm control, three-person assist-to-floor, seated floor restraint, and a supine restraint, during which C1 continued to kick staff, make homicidal threats, and attempt to get out of the restraint holds. Confidential interview indicated that, following the incident, staff observed that C1\u2019s ankle was swelling and advised that C1 needed to be sent out for evaluation. Records reviewed indicated that C1 left the area of their living unit and continued to make homicidal statements. Records reviewed indicated that C1 was placed in another restraint and subsequently transported to a local hospital. A review of records indicated that C1 was diagnosed with an ankle fracture. Confidential interviews produced conflicting statements regarding use of excessive force during restraint holds. Records review and confidential interviews gave no indication that staff were not properly trained or that inappropriate restraint techniques were used during the reported incident involving C1. The investigation did not produce corroborating evidence that the injury sustained by C1 was caused by staff not following the facility\u2019s approved restraint techniques, and there is no video surveillance that captured the incident. Based on confidential interviews and review of pertinent documents, the allegations that staff used inappropriate restraint techniques on minor in care and staff caused injury to minor in care may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

    "narrative": ".... CONTINUED During the investigation, LPA Saeteurn interviewed clients (C1 -C9), staff (S2-S6), one witness (W1) and reviewed pertinent facility records. Confidential interviews revealed that staff at the facility are instructed to perform walk troughs of the homes to ensure everything is in operating condition. Confidential interviews indicated that on September 9, 2024, S3 was performing a walk through of the facility to ensure that everything was in proper working order and if any repairs or maintenance were needed. Confidential interviews revealed that S3 was checking on the condition of the restroom located next to C1\u2019s room when S3 observed a candle and burnt matches on the restroom sink area. Confidential interviews revealed that when S3 found the candle inside the restroom, S3 called S4 to inquire who the candles belonged to. Confidential interviews revealed that staff were unaware who the candle and matches in the restroom belonged to, but staff also found two candles in C1\u2019s bedroom. Confidential interviews revealed that the candles that belonged to C1 were located on a dresser/vanity that is placed next to the restroom door and were found in plain sight. A walk through inspection of the facility performed by LPA Saeteurn revealed that in order to access the restroom where the candle and matches were found by S3, the restroom would need to be accessed from entrances located inside client rooms. The restroom can be accessed through an entrance located in front of C1\u2019s bedroom area. A review of pertinent records show that students are notified through their student handbook that staff are to \u201cvisually inspect student rooms to ensure student safety and cleanliness.\u201d The handbook also details that \u201cstaff do not conduct invasive inspections of student\u2019s personal items without reasonable cause, but staff have the right to clean and organize a student\u2019s bedroom in order to meet state guidelines and regulations\u201d. Confidential Interviews confirmed that staff are instructed to check minor\u2019s rooms daily to ensure they are \u201cclean\u201d and free of debris or hazards. Confidential Interviews indicated that after the candles were found in C1\u2019s room, S3 had a conversation with S4 and requested that staff remind C1 and all other minors in care that burning candles in the facility is not allowed for safety reasons.\n\nCONTINUED... Confidential interviews revealed the candles were left where they were found and S3 disposed of the matches. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 was informed that lighting candles in the facility is not allowed, but a conflicting confidential interview disclosed that only C1 was asked to stop lighting candles. A confidential interview revealed staff did not discuss the matter with other clients in the facility. Due to refusal of interviews from clients, LPA was unable to confirm if S4 discussed the information with any other minors other than C1. Based on LPA observation and confidential interviews conducted, the allegations that facility staff unreasonably searched a minor\u2019s personal belongings and staff were not treating the minor with dignity are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. An exit interview was conducted with Richard Boyer, Program Director. A copy of this report and appeal rights were provided and reviewed with Richard Boyer, Program Director, whose signatures on this report confirm receipt of these documents.",

Confidential interviews revealed that during the summer, clients participated in a summer pool event in which both clients and staff were present. Confidential interviews confirmed S1 was present and supervising clients when S1 jumped into the pool while clients were swimming.

A confidential interview with S1 confirmed their presence in the pool with clients. A confidential interview revealed that staff are allowed to swim with clients at the facility however, other confidential interviews reveal that there is no set policy. Confidential interviews revealed that the facility does not have a policy regarding staff entering the pool to swim with clients, but some confidential interviews reveal that staff do not believe it is allowed. During the process of the investigation confidential interviews also revealed that both S2 and S4 have supervised clients while at the pool, however contradicting confidential interviews revealed that there have been no situations in which clients reported feeling uncomfortable with other staff while at the pool. A confidential interview revealed that S2 once transported C1 and made an uncomfortable comment stating \u201cI save the best for last\u201d while transporting the client in care.

Confidential interviews revealed that when S5 arrived at the school it was not communicated to them that C1 needed to be signed out of school.

Confidential interviews revealed S5 was going to transport C1 to the interview but C1 declined to go due to the time delays. Confidential interviews and a review of facility records revealed that facility residents are instructed to submit a form to request transportation. Confidential interviews indicate that the transportation form must be submitted on the Wednesday prior to the date of transportation to ensure arrangements are made and to prevent any issues.

Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that staff often come much later, around 30 minutes to an hour late, to pick clients up from school. Confidential interviews and a review of text messages with staff indicated that the delays in picking up clients is due to staff forgetting to pick up clients. Conflicting interviews and observations indicated that student pickups are planned ahead of time with pre-assigned staff. Confidential interviews also indicated that clients are picked up late from school due to understaffing, as well as some staff not being willing to conduct transports. Confidential interviews indicated that late pick-ups from school have become less frequent than when the complaint was received in 2024, but late pick-ups are still occurring. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that staff did not pick up minor from school in a timely manner is substantiated because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met.

Additional confidential interviews reported that some staff can be disrespectful and belittling to youth. On at least one occasion, staff were mocking students about their interest in non-enrolled youth sneaking onto campus. Staff was reported as saying \u201cthey are getting excited over nothing.\u201d Other confidential interview revealed that staff want to have power over the youth. Students do not appreciate this and are becoming tired. Confidential interviews were conflicting and did not provide consistent information to conclude that staff do not treat minors with dignity or respect. Regarding the allegation that staff do not provide adequate food service to minors, specifically, it was reported that the food is bland, and staff only serve processed food. Confidential interviews reported that the students are provided with a caf\u00e9 while on campus, and when in their dorms, they have a kitchenette, refrigerator, cabinets of food, and access to a stove. Confidential interviews reported that the caf\u00e9 offers options such as fruits, vegetables, and salads if the main entr\u00e9e is not wanted. Other confidential interviews reported that on Mondays through Fridays the caf\u00e9 serves adequate food. On the weekends, food is available in the dorms, but staff may or may not cook. If there is a lack of food available, the students can go to another dorm and eat there. Additional confidential interviews revealed that breakfast can range from bacon and eggs to French toast, sausage, cereal, or fruit.

    "narrative": "...CONTINUED Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that on two occasions, C1 slept for multiple days on the couch in another unit following altercations with peers in their own cottage, with the most recent instance lasting for approximately one week, until a bedroom in the temporary unit became available. Confidential interviews indicated C1 was instructed by management to sleep on the couch due to ongoing conflict with their roommate and was not offered alternative sleeping arrangements. Conflicting confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that C1 was initially relocated to the couch for safety reasons and was subsequently offered several alternatives which C1 declined, including a bedroom in another living unit, mediation with their roommate, and changing room assignments in their original living unit. Confidential interviews indicated that accommodations were not made for C1 while they were staying on the couch, such as being able to shower. Conflicting confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated that accommodations were made for C1 from the time C1 moved out of their room, including allowing C1 to shower in a separate unit kept for program alumni after C1 refused other shower accommodations for multiple days. LPA observations indicated that the shower in the alumni unit was clean and working properly, and that the couch C1 slept on was in good condition. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that staff did not prevent a minor from sleeping in a common area is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted with Dana Centanni, Administrator and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided.",

During investigations, confidential interviews disclosed that staff did not take C1 to the hospital for medical attention after C1 punched the door and injured C1\u2019s hand. Another confidential interview reported that the reason for not transporting C1 to the hospital was that staff didn\u2019t want to wait at the hospital. A confidential interview disclosed that it took the facility approximately one hour to locate a staff member available to transport C1. By the time transportation was arranged, C1 reportedly no longer wanted to go. Confidential interviews further disclosed that C1 declined medical attention multiple times following the incident but provided ice and over-the-counter pain medication. Additionally, one confidential interview indicated that C1 didn\u2019t report wanting to see a doctor to their social worker. LPA received conflicting information. Based on interviews, the allegation staff did not seek medical attention to C1 while in care in a timely manner may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violation, therefore, this allegation is unsubstantiated at this time.

It was specifically reported that C2 assaulted C1 at the facility. The assault involved strangling, punching, choking, and biting, which resulted in C1 losing consciousness and sustaining multiple bruises to various parts of the body.During investigation, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that staff did not intervene until the altercation was already in progress. Confidential interviews further revealed that S3 was the only staff member in the facility at the time of the altercation, however, staff was not present when the events leading up to the altercation occurred. As a result, staff were unable to prevent or de-escalate the situation before it escalated to violence. Additionally, multiple interviews confirmed that there was only one staff member present for six to seven clients. S3 reported calling for backup during the incident; however, they were unable to intervene effectively and manage the safety of the other clients while the fights continued. Based on interview and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the Department has determined that due to lack of care and supervision C2 physically engaged inappropriately with C1 while in care. Therefore, the allegation is substantiated.

C1 then left the house to return to the front office. It was reported that when C1 arrived at the office, PSW did not see C1. Therefore, C1 was out of staff sight for more than 30 minutes and was unaccounted for over an hour after expressing suicidal thoughts. During investigation, the information gathered showed inconsistencies regarding C1\u2019s whereabouts and level of supervision. While other confidential interviews reported that C1 was unsupervised and unaccounted for after expressing suicidal ideation, other confidential interviews stated that the issue was primarily due to miscommunication and that C1 was not considered missing. LPA received conflicting information. It was alleged that staff failed to report an incident involving C1 while in care. Specifically, it was reported that C1 was encountered for over an hour after expressing suicidal ideations, but no incident report was completed. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 was not missing which is why C1 was not formally encountered for. However, it was confirmed that C1 did express suicidal ideations. Another confidential interview disclosed that C1 was not missing for a significant amount of time, however, conflicting information was provided regarding whether an incident report should have been generated, given C1\u2019s disclosure of suicidal thought despite not being missing. LPA received conflicting information. Based on interviews, the allegations that staff did not adequately supervise C1 in care and staff did not report an incident involving C1 in care as necessary may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations, therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

However, it was revealed that at the time of the incident, C1 was using illegal drugs at a friend\u2019s house and not at the facility (Serenity House). Confidential statements obtained revealed clients denied using or bringing drugs into the facility other than marijuana. Statements revealed facility staff members conduct random room checks on an ongoing routine basis. It was also revealed that staff members further check clients upon their return from an unauthorized absence. Information obtained found that staff follow facility protocols and procedures for AWOLs upon occurrence. Statements obtained produced a lack of corroborating evidence to prove clients use illegal drugs while in the facility or that staff fail to prevent clients from leaving the facility without permission. Therefore, based on all information obtained during the investigation, the allegation is deemed unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On February 9, 2023 at 12:15 AM, Associate Governmental Program Analyst (AGPA) Kim Robinson met with the group home (GH) program director, Dr. Evelyn Vasquez, in order to assess an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP). Administrator, Tiffany Mileda, attended the meeting via Teams. On June 1, 2022, the Department concluded a complaint investigation alleging that Staff #1 (S1) engaged in sexual acts with a child, resulting with sexual assault of seventeen-year-old client #1 (C1). These allegations were determined substantiated, and the GH was cited for Personal Rights from the Title 22, California Code of Regulations Section 84072 (d)(11). See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated February 9, 2023. Based on the analysis of the interviews, medical reports and findings from the San Diego Sheriff report the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for the sexual abuse of C1. The Penal Code Section 11165.1 defines sexual conduct with a minor as physical abuse. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health & Safety Code section 1548 (f)(1)(C), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,500.00. An exit interview was completed and appeal rights discussed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List, and a Civil Penalty Assessment - Serious Bodily Injury/Physical Abuse (Form 421-D) were provided to the program director. The signed copy will be retained in the facility file.",

    "narrative": "On February 16, 2021, CCL received an allegation that staff (Staff #1 [S1]) neglected a minor (Child #1 [C1]) resulting in a death. Specifically, it was reported C1 was found hanging in C1\u2019s bedroom closet by group home social worker [S1]. Record review revealed S1 was the only staff at the facility at the time of the incident with three residents. A record review and information obtained from confidential interviews revealed S1 remained in the staff office the majority of S1\u2019s shift only exiting the office at 8:28 am to assist C1 with breakfast and at 9:29 am to assist C3 with retrieving paper towels from the garage and to assist with medication disbursement. Record review revealed at 12:37pm C2 called for S1 due to not being able to locate C1 and it was at that time S1 left the staff office and found C1 hanging in the closet. Observation of video footage provided by the facility confirms timeline noted in record review. Record review of the needs and services plan for C1 notes that safety checks are done every 15-30 minutes. Confidential interviews report that safety checks consist of opening the resident\u2019s bedroom doors and placing eyes on the resident. Confidential interviews report on the date of the incident S1 did not conduct the safety checks as required by the needs and services plan for C1. Based on record review, observation of video footage, and confidential interviews the allegation that staff (Staff #1 [S1]) neglected a minor (Child #1 [C1]) resulting in a death is substantiated. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met. Facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards(ILS), Regulation 87078(b) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (b) The licensee shall provide those services identified in each child\u2019s or nonminor dependent\u2019s needs and services plan, or Transitional Independent Living Plan, as necessary to meet the child\u2019s or nonminor dependent\u2019s needs.

Authorized representative statements confirm that Regional Center did not receive notice of there being no newly hired administrator to replace the former administrator nor that licensee was the sole caretaker at that point and was taking over the role of administrator and caretaker. Further, CCL was not notified of the change of administrator when licensee took over the administrator role. Additionally, per the program plan and the program's LIC 9106 Group Home Program Statement, the facility is to maintain at minimum a 1:6 childcare worker to resident ratio. The program plan includes in the program description a discussion of the consumer notes binder and lists as a section to be maintained \"Overnight visits away from the facility.\" The program plan also lists under the job description for licensee that licensee is to \"employ staff as necessary to ensure provision of care and supervision to meet consumers' needs.\" Licensee stated that there were staff available to hire but that she did not hire them because she was able to care for R1 on her own due to R1 having manageable behaviors. While licensee was the sole caretaker, the consumer shift notes were not completed, the home visit was not documented and filed in R1's binder, and discharge paperwork was not completed. As a result, LPA needed to verify dates of R1's home visit and R1's discharge with licensee's personal calendar, R1's parents, and the licensee of R1's new placement. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. LPA is issuing two citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 84061 Reporting Requirements and 80022 Plan of Operation. See attached LIC 9099-D.

During investigation, LPA conducted confidential interviews with licensee and authorized representatives of resident R1 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names, dated 4/13/22). Based on record review and interviews, the licensee was first notified of former administrator Maria Lourdes Bicomong's resignation on 11/18/21 when Maria emailed her resignation letter to licensee and forwarded that email to LPA Hawkins and two (2) Regional Center workers, Ashley Henderson and Amy Shwartz, on 11/19/21. LPA followed-up with licensee on 11/23/21 to ensure licensee had the checklist for having a new administrator approved. LPA reviewed licensee's phone record, submitted by licensee, and found it to reflect that the earliest call to Regional Center Case Manager Ashley Henderson was on 12/20/21, and shift notes and licensee statements confirm that Maria's last day, as well as the only direct care staff member's last day, was on 12/12/21.",

Upon entering the home, LPA met with Maria Tan, Facility Manager, and informed her of the reason for the visit. LPA reviewed the outstanding POC issued on 04/03/2025 regarding the requirement to maintain records of emergency drills at the facility. The Facility Manager provided documentation confirming that the last drill was conducted in February 2025, which falls within the current quarter and meets regulatory requirements. LPA verified the documentation and cleared the POC. LPA also amended the POC issued on 04/30/2025 and extended the due date to 05/19/2025. The extension was granted due to unclear language in the original deficiency, which did not specify that the licensee may submit a request to update the facility\u2019s Program Statement to serve clients outside of the currently approved population. The facility is currently licensed to serve developmentally disabled clients; however, record review revealed that one client does not meet the criteria for this population. During the visit, the Facility Manager stated an interest in also serving non-ambulatory clients in the future. LPA reminded the Facility Manager that, prior to accepting any clients outside the current approved parameters, the following must be submitted and approved by the Department: Continues on LIC809-C\n\nA revised Program Statement reflecting the proposed changes, Supplemental documents of approval from the placing agency (e.g., county or regional center), social worker, or legal guardian, A detailed plan outlining how the client\u2019s needs will be accommodated, and An updated and approved fire clearance from the local fire authority.

The facility is licensed to serve up to six clients. At the time of the inspection, one client, two staff members, and the Licensee were present. The client declined to be interviewed. At approximately 11:00 AM, LPA Medina began a physical inspection of the home using the CARES Inspection Tool. The facility has five bedrooms, one of which is designated for double occupancy. Currently, one client resides in the double-occupancy room. All bedrooms were observed to be clean, well-maintained, and equipped with adequate storage space. At approximately 11:15 AM, during an inspection of the laundry room, LPA observed an unsecured bucket of laundry detergent. LPA informed the DSP that leaving the detergent unsecured is a violation of Title 22 regulations. As a result, a Type A deficiency will be cited. Please refer to LIC 809-D for details. At approximately 11:20 AM, LPA inspected the backyard and observed that a section of the fence was broken. The Licensee discussed a plan to repair the fence.

A confidential interview indicated that while C1 was still a minor in care, S1 made a comment to C1 regarding a future romantic relationship together, that S1 and C1\u2019s relationship became sexual while C1 was still a minor and attending a career training program, and that S1 would secretly sign C1 out of their program over the weekends to stay with S1. A review of photographs and text messages indicated an intimate relationship between S1 and C1 had developed at some point, and that S1 asked C1 to lie to Storefront staff to conceal the nature of their relationship after C1 was no longer a minor. An additional confidential interview indicated that S1 and C1\u2019s relationship was close\u2014consisting of hugs, kisses on the cheek, and spending time together after hours\u2014but denied that it was sexual. Records reviewed indicated that S1 signed C1 out of their career training program while C1 was still a minor, although C1 was no longer a Storefront client.

    "narrative": "...CONTINUED Confidential interviews and records revealed that S1 remained C1\u2019s case manager for the duration of C1\u2019s stays at the facility despite being admonished for having an inappropriate relationship, crossing professional boundaries, and spending too much time with C1. A review of photographs and text messages indicated an intimate relationship had developed between S1 and C1 at some point, and that S1 asked C1 to lie to Storefront staff to conceal the nature of their relationship after C1 was no longer a minor. A confidential interview indicated that S1 made a comment to C1 while they were still a minor client regarding a future romantic relationship together, that their relationship became sexual while C1 was still a minor and attending a career training program, and that S1 would secretly sign C1 out of their program over the weekends to stay with S1; however, no witnesses to these incidents were named during the interview. A conflicting confidential interview indicated that S1 and C1\u2019s relationship was close\u2014consisting of hugs, kisses on the cheek, and spending time together after hours\u2014but denied that it was sexual; however, the interviewee could not explain the previously mentioned photographs. Records reviewed indicated that S1 signed C1 out of their career training program, as previously reported, while C1 was still a minor but not while C1 was a Storefront client. Although S1\u2019s interactions with C1 were inappropriate, the investigation did not yield sufficient evidence to conclude that the relationship was sexual. Based on conflicting confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that staff engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a minor while in care may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred, therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted with Renatta Escobedo, Administrator and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided.",

It was also reported that S1 had previously been admonished by Storefront management for spending excessive time with C1 and showing favoritism, including an incident where staff observed S1 and C1 \u201chuddled together\u201d during a case-management session and separating quickly when others entered the room.

    "narrative": "When interviewed, S1 admitted to the conversation about \"black people being so black they are blue\" and about \"Mexicans being referred to as beaners\". When asked why S1 would have that type of conversation with the clients in care, S1 stated that S1 has black and Mexican family members and that it was S1's intent to have an informational conversation only. S1 stated that the clients in the facility did bring up anal sex and did ask if S1 engaged in this with S1's spouse but S1 states that they shut the conversation down and would not engage with the clients. Other staff members acknowledged S1's inappropriate conversations and have had conversations with S1 about appropriate conversations around clients and with clients. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff made inappropriate comments to clients is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard has been met. The facility was cited for violation of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Section 84072 Personal Rights. The facility did not ensure that the clients were afforded dignity in their personal relationships with staff in that staff had inappropriate conversations around clients in care. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documents were provided along with appeal rights.\n\nmedications not being returned from a home visit. Of the other seven medication errors, there is not a pattern of staff making the medication errors. As a result of this information, the allegation that medications are not being administered as required is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that the facility is not following safety protocols is related to the facility being short staffed and not having enough staff to ensure the safety of the youth in care. When interviewed, staff indicated that there is never a time when the facility did not meet the one staff to three clients ratio. The facility acknowledged that it is always their goal to have one staff to two clients as a safety measure but that that is not always possible. Since the facility is meeting or exceeding the requirement of one staff per ten clients in care, the allegation that the facility is not following safety protocols is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

LPA Hill discussed an incident report dated 4/2/23 where Pioneer house had combined houses with another house due to staffing issues and Pioneer youth were sent to the other location for the weekend. C1 had returned to the alternate location and was asked to sleep in the recreation room on a couch as it was not appropriate to place C1 in a bed(room) occupied by a youth of a different sex/identity. LPA Hill cautioned the facility on this as it may be a violation of personal rights by having the youth sleep in that area and/or it may have been a better plan for the youth to transition back to their own residences knowing that C1 was returning on this date. The agency acknowledges that this was poor planning on behalf of the agency and states that they should not have the same issues moving forward as they are fully staffed and can meet the full staffing levels needed without combining houses. LPA Hill discussed medication incident reports received since January 1, 2023, detailing medication errors due to medications not being picked up, staff forgetting to administer at time(s) prescribed by doctors or other staff/facility errors. LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that the Department is not concerned for medication errors due to pharmacy not having medications but errors that are within the control of Summitview and staff, are of concern. LPA Hill asked Ms. Randle how the facility has addressed or is planning to address this issue to ensure that there are no medication errors due to staffing and/or Summitview not having the prescribed medications on site? Ms. Randle states that medication training was conducted with all residential staff and the agency has begun to track for medication patterns and staff responsible for any medication errors moving forward will be retrained immediately and/or corrective actions conducted with said staff.\n\nIn addition, Summitview's Health Services has met with transporters to ensure that refills and notifications are sent to transporters a minimum of seven to ten days prior to medications running out and refill requests are completed. Controlled medications are counted daily and other medications are counted twice weekly. When these counts happen, staff are to notify Health Services for refill of medications a minimum of ten days prior to the medications running out in an effort to prevent the facility from running out of medications. LPA Hill requested a written policy that would indicate how all of these things will be defined and/or put into place shall be provided to Licensing by 5/1/23. LPA Hill also discussed a serious incident of injury that took place on 3/13/23 for C2. The report indicates that the incident involved C2 gaining access to the roof at the nonpublic school site and C2 jumping or falling from the roof causing serious injury. LPA Hill requested written statements from all individuals listed on the incident report and/or present or involved to indicate what was seen, what the staff persons' part in the incident were. LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that this incident may need further investigation and requested that the written statements be provided to LPA by 4/21/23. Exit interview conducted and documentation was provided to Ms. Randle. No citations were issued during this inspection.",

LPA Hill toured the facility inside and out and observed that the facility was clean and sanitary. LPA Hill observed that the client bedrooms had the required furniture and storage requirements for the clients in care and had the appropriate beds and bedding as required by the regulations. LPA Hill observed that the smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors were functioning as required. LPA Hill observed that the fire extinguishers were present, charged and inspected as required. LPA Hill observed that the facility had the required amount of perishable and nonperishable food in the facility. LPA Hill did check expiration dates on the foods in the pantry and did not observe any expired foods. LPA Hill observed hot water in both bathrooms and showers, toilets and sinks all functioned as required. LPA Hill observed that the kitchen had all of the required cooking items and cutlery required for the clients in care. LPA Hill asked about the large sharps trash bin that is located in the back yard and how the facility could better secure it to ensure youth do not have access. This bin is as big as the normal trash containers and has an opening on top where, if youth tip it upside down, the items would/could fall out, easily giving access to what is inside. LPA Hill did not observe any violations at the facility during the physical plant inspection. File review was conducted at Golden Plaza for the remainder of the post licensing inspection. Exit interview conducted with Mr. Navarrete.",

LPA Hill conducted this case management inspection to review files for staff and clients. LPA Hill did note that while conducting the physical plant inspection at the facility, there is naloxone which is an over the counter medication which rapidly reverses an opioid overdose should a client in care be experiencing one. LPA Hill did advise the facility that per Provider Information Notice (PIN) 21-12-CRP, the facility is required to obtain a waiver to have/use this medication when/if a client is experiencing any signs or symptoms of an opioid overdose. Ms. Randle states that she will ensure that the waiver is submitted to Licensing as soon as possible as they do keep this in the first aid kit. In addition, the facility shall ensure that it is addressed with the primary physician in that it needs to be specified in the clients' PRN medication list maintained in the individual client files. LPA Hill did remind the facility that they are to keep at the facility, all licensing reports for a minimum of three years per Health and Safety Code, Section 1538.5(a)(3). LPA Hill reviewed staff and client files and did not issue any violations during the inspection but did issue three technical violations during the inspection for discharge policies, psychotropic medication logs that require date of the prescription rather than date medication is filled, and the requirement to maintain a list of individual(s) allowed to visit with youth while in care are all required.

LPA Hill conducted this inspection to review staff and client records, emergency intervention records, staff training records, and other records as it pertains to the annual inspection. LPA Hill also interviewed one staff during the inspection. LPA Hill was unable to use the electronic inspection tool during this inspection as it was not available and/or inaccessible during the inspection. LPA Hill utilized a manual care tool document. LPA Hill observed that none of the youth in this facility have the parent/guardian written authorization for administration of psychotropic medication as required and LPA Hill did issue a citation related to this requirement. LPA Hill cited the facility per 84070(b)(12) Children's Records which requires a written authorization of the child's parent or guardian, for each psychotropic medication as four out of four youth lack this document in their files. During the inspection of the records, LPA Hill observed that the facility does not have a separate discipline policy for parent/guardian to sign when youth are admitted to the facility. LPA Hill did issue an Technical Violation for this requirement during the inspection. In addition, during the review of facility records, LPA Hill observed that the restraint log does not indicate a duration of the restraint which is required by regulation. LPA Hill did issue an Technical Violation for this as the facility did not have this on the restraint log for this facility.

Confidential interviews indicated that nobody really saw a hit happen but all staff and clients did see the horse play happening. Interviews and camera review indicate that following the horse play, client and staff remained in the common area for a while, engaged and talking and there were no signs of distress.

LPA Hill discussed the following incidents with Mr. Navarrete: 6/27/24 - LPA Hill discussed the incident involving youth in the home. The incident report details the events of the incident, including staff's ability to \"keep [C3 and C2] separated\" and \"in different spaces of the house. The report goes on to say that while separated, S1 went out to call law enforcement. LPA Hill advised that contacting law enforcement should only be when there is an immediate threat (see Technical Violation given dated 7/18/24). Mr. Navarrete states that the agency trainer sent out a reminder about how/when to contact law enforcement. This document dated 7/11/24 was sent by the agency trainer, Richard Kartchner. LPA Hill obtained a copy of this document and it meets Community Care Licensing's standards for contacting law enforcement protocol. Combining Houses. LPA Hill in general spoke to Anna Gleason, CEO about combining houses and when the agency is doing this. Ms. Gleason states that when census is low, due to youth going home on home passes on the weekend, they combine the houses in an effort to alleviate staffing issues that they experience on weekends. Ms. Gleason states they do notifications to placing agency when any youth is to be moved and get permission prior to proceeding. In addition, Ms. Gleason states that they do compatibility assessments of the youth to ensure youth will get along. In addition, no child welfare youth is ever placed in one of the agency's group home(s). LPA Hill informed that CCL is never provided an incident report about the houses combining and that this is necessary to ensure CCL knows where youth are and when houses are not operating during any length of time. Ms. Gleason states that moving incident reports will be provided. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided.",

When interviewed, parents stated while they were not sure if they received the documents upon their child's admission, they were emotional and more focused on getting C1 out of their previous high-level placement than the signing of paperwork. Both parents indicated Summitview has been very transparent since their child has been in the facility and they receive frequent communication about what their child is doing while at the facility. Based on the investigation, observation, records reviewed, and interviews conducted, the complaint allegation that staff did not provide a copy of facility discipline policies to youth upon admission are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The Department has investigated the complaint allegation that staff did not ensure individual privacy was provided to youth in the restroom. Confidential interviews indicate that while on \u201cSafety Watch\u201d the restroom door must be left open a crack and staff are to guard the door when youth are in the restroom to ensure the safety of youth. It was reported that staff left their watch at the door which violated C1\u2019s privacy because other youths could see C1 while using the restroom. Staff interviews indicate while youth are on Safety Watch, staff are required to be positioned outside the restroom door to ensure youth privacy as part of the Safety Watch requirement. Staff further indicated that there is never a reason for staff to leave the door unattended with a youth who is on Safety Watch inside the restroom. Staff, as well the Director of Youth Residential Programs, stated the door is only cracked to ensure youth's privacy in the restroom. Staff indicated that if a youth is to be placed on Safety Watch by their therapist, this is discussed with the youth to ensure they understand the need for supervision and safety. LPA Shelton obtained a copy of C1\u2019s Safety Watch that outlines the door being cracked for the safety of the client. Staff interviewed could not recall a time when staff left the restroom door unattended while a client was on a safety watch and using the restroom. Based on the investigation, observation, records reviewed, and interviews conducted, the complaint allegation that staff did not ensure individual privacy was provided to youth in the restroom is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

The full report does not have details about what transpired or what was observed as to why the alcohol bottle was not searched for, was youth taken to a medical center for medical clearance for being under the influence, etc. LPA Hill requested that the additional information be added to the report and the report be resubmitted to Licensing.\n\nAnother report discussed during the case management inspection was a report dated 3/6/23 for C4 where C4 was found to have written a \"poem\" while in school indicating a plan to \"shoot up\" the nonpublic school location and/or \"spray kids with mace\".

LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that the Department is not concerned for medication errors due to pharmacy not having medications but errors that are within the control of Summitview and staff, are of concern. LPA Hill asked Ms. Randle how the facility has addressed this issue to ensure that there are no medication errors due to staffing and/or Summitview not having the prescribed medications on site. Ms. Randle states that medication training was conducted with all residential staff and the Department has begun to track for medication patterns and any staff responsible for medication errors will be retrained immediately and/or corrective actions conducted with said staff. Health services have met with transporters to ensure that refills and notifications are sent to transporters a minimum of seven to ten days prior to medications running out and refill requests are completed. Controlled medications are counted daily and other medications are counted twice weekly. When these counts happen, staff are to notify Health Services for refill of medications in an effort to prevent the facility from running out medications.

Ms. Randle states that she will ensure that the waiver is submitted to Licensing as soon as possible as they do keep this in the first aid kit. In addition, the facility shall ensure that it is addressed with the primary physician in that it needs to be specified in the clients' PRN medication list maintained in the individual client files. LPA Hill did remind the facility that they are to keep at the facility, all licensing reports for a minimum of three years per Health and Safety Code, Section 1538.5(a)(3).

LPA Hill asked that the incident report be updated to include C3's information as required. According to the incident report received and via video review conducted by Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs, the cameras were reviewed from the evening of 5/6/24 indicating that C1 and C2 were seated close to one another and an inappropriate interaction does appear to happen between C1 and C2 while seated on the couch despite the youths' denials. Staff were not working during the inspection so staff could not be interviewed. LPA Hill did interview C1, C2, and C3 while at the agency. LPA Hill learned that C2 was moved to another house to ensure the health and safety for C1 and C2. LPA Hill informed Mr. Navarrete that further investigation is needed at this time.

The age exceptions for the other two residents have expired or will expire soon. One expired in August 2022, and one was extended until the end of May 2023. The licensee initially planned to acquire a new property for the ARF but has since determined the better plan is to transition this facility into an ARF. The licensee has provided evidence of support from GGRC for their plans to open an ARF and agrees to provide the licensing agency with the following: 1) By Friday 6/30/23, the licensee will submit their ARF application to the CCLD Adult & Senior Care Program Centralized Application Bureau. 2) Following submission of the ARF application, the licensee will let send LPA the assigned license number for the ARF application. 3) The licensee will continue to provide periodic updates until the ARF has been licensed. A copy of this report was provided to Administrator Anne Marie Soler, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Administrator Juvy Golub and Facility Manager Rahanat Abubakar and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation at the facility, LPA conducted confidential interviews of currently employed staff. During the interviews, LPA observed that multiple staff were aware of their mandated reporter status and what that meant but were unfamiliar with their responsibility to report to outside agencies such as CPS, adult protective services, and the police directly if they observe abuse or neglect. Review of personnel records reflected that all staff had received recent training on mandated reporting and had signed an acknoweldgement of requirement to report child abuse. LPA is issuing an advisory to advise that staff be retrained during an in-house training where staff demonstrate their knowledge of reporting protocols. Additionally, during an investigation at the facility, LPA learned that 2 reportable incidents were not reported to the appropriate agencies, including the licensing agency. Interviews with administrator and facility manager indicate that the former facility manager was recently terminated due to not following reporting procedures. Based on LPA's discussion with Administrator and Facility Manager, both are familiar with the reporting requirements. LPA is issuing an advisory to advise that written incident reports for the reportable incidents discussed at today's visit, including the incident in which a resident was physically assaulted by a staff member and the incident in which a resident fell from their bed and sustained bruising, are sent to the licensing agency and authorized representative (Regional Center) within 7 days of today's visit.

A copy of this report and the licensee's appeal rights were provided at the end of the visit.\n\nRegarding the allegation that the facility did not provide care and supervision, based on confidential observations, interviews, and record review, the facility and/or licensee allegedly did not attend a client's individualized education plan (IEP) meeting at which the client's transportation arrangements were to be discussed due to the client's increased behaviors preventing safe transportation. Based on interviews and record review, the licensee questioned in written correspondence if it was their responsibility to ensure transportation to school when there is a written agreement for third party school transportation and the facility does not have education rights for the client. The IEP meeting was specifically called to revise the transportation agreement due to the school district facing repeated challenges preventing the safe transportation of the client. However, other members of the care team did not attend due to the meeting being short-notice and/or not being invited, and the facility staff member who would have attended reportedly ended up being unable to attend due to demands at the facility. The arrangement discussion continued via email correspondence. Regarding the allegation that the facility did not accord personal rights, based on confidential observations, interviews, and record review, the facility and/or licensee allegedly did not communicate appropriately or effectively with members of a client's care team about the client's care and their care needs. Based on interviews and record review, multiple parties reported and provided written documentation of facility representative(s) being reportedly uncooperative. Facility staff deny the interactions went as reported. The documented correspondence reflects challenges in communication. However, the correspondence reflects facility representatives' repeated attempts at communication with the care team. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur.

Further, the evidence does not support the allegation that the incident was falsely reported nor that a discharge process was initiated on the basis of a false report.

Administrator and Teresita stated that Teresita went out of the country and was in the Phillipines from January 2019 to July 2019, then again from November 5, 2019 to November 17, 2019. Administrator confirmed that they did not notify Licensing of the change of administrator and showed LPA a LIC 308 designating Paolo Reyes and Richelle Solsoloy, per Administrator, as facility managers. Administrator and Teresita believed that they were co-administrators because Teresita was previously the administrator.

However, the alcohol was visible to staff S2, so it is unclear if S1 was drinking while working and if the alcohol was accessible to residents. Additionally, it was reported that staff may be having sexual activity with other staff members at the facility site, but based on interviews, this could be neither proved nor disproved.

    "narrative": "On 9/25/2019, staff S1 (See LIC 811) noticed a bruise on R1's upper right shoulder blade, which was described in the facility incident report as measuring 6 inches wide and 3 inches long. Staff were unaware of how the bruise was sustained, and R1 was not seen by a medical professional for the injury. Staff were unable to be interviewed, as all staff were terminated due to all clients being removed on 11/15/2019 by Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC). According to R1's Individual Program Plan (IPP), R1 is to have one-on-one supervision while at the facility. Additionally, GGRC has authorized additional funding for the facility to provide staffing to meet R1's needs. Further, neither of the above injuries to R1 were reported or written reports sent to GGRC or to Community Care Licensing (CCL). The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. The facility is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and 80061 Reporting Requirements. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Administrator Maria Reyes, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA.\n\nAlthough staff reported to medical personnel that they were unaware of the bruise prior to 4/10/2019, the incident report indicates they observed the bruise on 4/2/2019 and that it was the result of an interaction with staff. Interviews with staff and R1 were attempted, but staff were unable to be interviewed as all staff were terminated due to clients being removed from care on 11/15/2019 by Golden Gate Regional Center, and R1 was unable to be interviewed due to being nonverbal. Although the allegation may have happened and/or is valid, based on the observations, record review, and IB\u2019s investigation findings, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies cited. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Administrator Maria Reyes, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA.",

According to an incident report, on 4/2/2019, R1 was in an altercation with an unknown staff member and a bruise was observed on R1's left hip. R1 was not seen by a doctor until 4/10/2019, which is when R1 was diagnosed with a hematoma to R1's left flank. While in the emergency room, facility staff reported the bruise was the result of an unwitnessed fall and that they heard a \"thump.\" Staff stated they did not see the bruise prior to 4/2/2019, but the incident report was written on 4/2/2019.",

    "narrative": "An office meeting was held on 11/10/2020 to discuss a substantiated allegation of physical abuse. The meeting was conducted as a conference call due to pandemic COVID-19 safety orders. Present on the call from Tipperary Home were Administrator Maria Reyes, Assistant Administrator Teresita Go, and Consultant Ann Ratto. Present from CDSS were Regional Manager Nelson Martinez, Licensing Program Manager Zaid Hakim, Licensing Program Analyst Mariah Hawkins, and Attorney Joel Kim. On 11/13/2019, the Department received a complaint (Control #14-CR-20191113143056) alleging minor sustained serious injuries while in care, staff did not seek medical treatment for minor, and staff did not notify minor's authorized representative. The investigation was referred to and conducted by the Investigations Branch (IB). The investigation revealed that child R1 (Refer to LIC 811 Confidential Names), who is developmentally delayed and nonverbal, sustained a fracture, bruising, and abrasions while in care. The fracture was a right humerus, upper arm bone fracture near the shoulder and dislocation. It was an oblique fracture with a break that was almost straight across with a little angle, and it required surgery. Staff S1 (Refer to LIC 811) stated she witnessed an incident on 11/10/2019 in which R1 fell and hit R1's wrist. S1 stated that she did not see any injury or abrasions. The facility did not notify the authorized representative of the injury and did not take the victim to the hospital until two days after the fall, on 11/12/2019. IB's investigation included interviews with multiple medical professionals and an abuse expert. Casey Brown, M.D., Medical Professional and Child Abuse Expert, determined that that the injuries were not consistent with a fall as described by S1. R1 would have hit multiple hard surfaces in the fall, been held down with R1's shoulder flattened, or fallen hard on a flexible object. Due to R1's small stature, Dr. Casey Brown determined that the injuries were high-force injuries, and it would have been hard for R1 to self-inflict the injuries R1 sustained. R1 was diagnosed with early Rickets due to Vitamin D deficiency, but the fracture was so severe that it caused a blood clot at the fracture site, meaning Rickets alone would not explain the injuries. Additionally, R1 presented at the hospital with visible abrasions and clear signs of injury and discomfort.\n\nDr. Brown determined that R1 would have been immediately and persistently symptomatic with the fracture and would have had significant pain with every dressing and diaper change. Further, during the investigation, IB Investigator measured the distance between the wall and tile near the toilet and found it to not match the spacing of the abrasions on R1's shoulder, meaning the fall as S1 described does not match the injuries noted in the medical exam. Dr. Brown discredited S1's narrative of the cause of R1's injuries. On July 14, 2020, the Department issued substantiated findings for the 11/13/2019 Complaint (Control #14-CR-20191113143056). The allegation that minor sustained serious injuries while in care was substantiated as physical abuse, and a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, Section 84072(d)(11) Personal Rights was issued. The Department has concluded an analysis and has determined that an Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted for serious bodily injury. The Penal Code \u00a7243 defines serious bodily injury as \u201ca serious impairment of physical condition, including, but not limited to, the following: loss of consciousness; concussion; bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ; a wound requiring extensive suturing; and serious disfigurement.\u201d Health and Safety Code \u00a71548(f)(1)(C) reads: \u201cFor a violation that the department determines constitutes physical abuse, as defined in paragraph (2), or resulted in serious bodily injury, as defined in Section 243 of the Penal Code, to a person receiving care at a therapeutic day services facility, community treatment facility, transitional shelter care facility, transitional housing placement provider, small family home, crisis nursery, group home, enhanced behavior supports home licensed as a group home, or short-term residential therapeutic program, the civil penalty shall be assessed as follows: (f) Two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for a facility licensed to care for 40 or fewer children.\u201d Today, 11/10/2020, the Department will be issuing a Civil Penalty per Health and Safety Code \u00a71548(f)(1)(C) for $2,500. The above was reviewed during the meeting, and appeal rights were provided. This report was sent via email to Administrator Maria Reyes, who agreed to sign the report and email back to LPA Hawkins.",

Lastly, 7 confidential interviews corroborated that the staff do not yell at the clients in care; however, LPA Carmona was unable to interview 2 clients and qualify 1 client in care during the investigation process. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are Unsubstantiated.

Minutes from the board of directors\u2019 meetings related to the facility\u2019s incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service plans, quarterly assessments, and emergency intervention plans, the licensee uses evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Michelle P. Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a youth or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to administrator Pushpinder K. Toor.",

    "narrative": "The investigation included review of facility file history, review of staff and client files, staff training, physical plant observations and review of related photographs. Investigators conducted multiple confidential interviews of six clients (current and former), nine staff members (current and former) and facility Administrator. Confidential interviews detailed occurrences of client\u2019s observations and/or experiences while in care involving staff\u2019s treatment towards clients. Interviews described that staff (S1 and S2), pulled resident\u2019s hair, pulled resident\u2019s ears, grabbed residents by the neck, choked residents with their sweatshirt hoodie, choked resident with their hands, and dragged residents on the floor. It was further revealed that clients have sustained bruises, scratches, and ripped shirts because of the abuse (LIC811, dated 9/5/2024). During this investigation it was also disclosed that staff members (S1 and S2) and possibly other staff, used an outdoor water hose on client (C1) while in the shower. Statements revealed admission of clients and staff hearing or witnessing the abuse towards C1. Witness accounts described hearing C1 screaming, C1\u2019s skin cold after the shower and no fog or condensation observed in the bathroom after the shower. Witness further confirmed C1 was fed aggressively by S2. The investigation further revealed that on or around 10/31/2022, S1 screwed the windows shut in client\u2019s (C2) bedroom reportedly to prevent C2 from eloping from the facility. After learning this incident, facility Administrator instructed staff to remove the screws from the window days later. Staff members were aware of staff\u2019s actions; however, this incident was not reported to CCL. Based on the confidential interviews and documentary evidence, the Department has determined that there is a preponderance of evidence that staff S1 and S2 physically abused clients C1, C2, C3 and C4 while in care. It was further determined based on gathered statements and physical observations and photographs of facility grounds, staff members S1 and S2 violated client\u2019s personal rights and/or caused safety hazards to clients in care. Therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. These actions pose an immediate health, safety, and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. The facility is issued citations in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 6, 84072 (d)(19) Personal Rights and Reporting Requirements. See following page for the cited deficiencies. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were discussed. A copy of this report, and appeal rights were provided to the Facility Administrator.\n\nConcerning allegation that staff denied food to resident(s) in care, confidential interviews found consistent statements that clients are not denied food by staff. Clients and staff informed that clients are afforded meals and snacks and not denied food unless there are documented dietary restrictions. LPA observed ample food supply (perishable and non-perishable) and snacks during the investigation. Statements and record review found that Staff ensure residents are provided their special dietary needs and specific instructions are documented for identified clients. Concerning allegation that staff mismanaged resident's personal belongings (money): Confidential interviews and record review revealed clients are afforded allowance according to their individual plan. Records were unable to identify or confirm allegation that staff mismanaged resident\u2019s personal belongings. Concerning allegation that staff did not follow residents' behavior plan as required. Confidential interviews and record review did not identify or produce specific concerns as to staff not following residents\u2019 behavior plan. Confidential interviews were unable to confirm or dispute the allegation that clients are threatened by staff as statements lacked corroborating evidence. Record review and confidential interviews found that residents are afforded visitation according to the individual visitation schedules. Statements and physical observations of facility grounds found facility staff take measures to ensure residents from wandering from the facility. Facility doors are equipped with alarms to alert staff when doors are opened or exiting. Record review and interviews indicate facility operates on a one-to-one staff to client ratio as approved. As to the allegation that Staff did not prevent resident in care from engaging in illegal activities, confidential interviews and record review lacked supporting evidence to support the alleged. Based on confidential interviews, documentary statements, record review, and unannounced facility observations during the investigation, determined that the reported allegations may have happened or may be valid, however, the allegations are not supported or proven by the evidence.",

LPA met with Alicia Carroll, Regional Programming Director. Insufficient staff training: During the course of a case management investigation, LPA observed a deficiency in staff training. Two Service Providers and three Authorized Representatives reported a lack of staff training, evident by staff inappropriately responding to client behaviors and failing to report client incidents. Two clients reported multiple incidents of staff unnecessarily putting hands on the clients. LPA reviewed staff training records provided by the facility. The total number hours of staff training was not listed in the records as required. Additionally, multiple staff trainings were completed within a few minutes. One staff was listed as completing 7 trainings in less than one hour. Four staff completed 5 trainings in less than 10 minutes each. The facility is issued a citation according to Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Article 06. Continuing Requirements 84065(j) Personnel Requirements: Annual Training (1) All child care staff shall complete a minimum of 20 hours of annual training. Reporting Requirements: LPA Hall interviewed staff on 5/12/22 regarding an incident which occurred on 5/3/22. The Serious Incident Report (SIR) was not documented until LPA Hall advised the facility to do so. An SIR was then submitted to the Department on 5/13/22, which is outside the required reporting timeframe. When interviewed, two authorized representatives reported several Serious Incidents had occurred which LPA did not find as having been documented by the facility. Three authorized representatives indicated they were not being notified of Serious Incidents by the facility. LPA reviewed previous Serious Incident Reports submitted by the facility and found discrepancies in the dates, including one Serious Incident which reportedly occurred on 3/30/22, but the report says the authorized representatives were notified on 3/2/22. Continued on 809C\n\nContinued from 9099 Another Serious Incident Report was reported as having occurred on 4/13/22, but was reported to the to the placing entity on 3/14/22, reducing validity.

During the interviews C1 and C2 both stated that they had never had an incident with a staff member. C1 was inconsistent with his statements. C2 denied seeing or being involved with any inapropriate incidents between staff and minors. There is a lack of clear evidence to make a determination as to whether a regulatory violation did occur. this department has investigated the allegations, and although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the staff or residents do not have access to food; therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated. Appeal rights were provided and discussed, and no deficiencies were cited. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report was sent to the facility.",

    "narrative": "S1 denied the allegation but C1 confirmed the allegation and in addition RP confirmed that she heard S1 confirm he hit C1 on the head with a broom and confidential interview revealed that C1 told S2 that S1 hit C1 with a broom. Internal Investigation, Special Incident Report and interviews were inconsistent from one another. Facility\u2019s internal investigation revealed that S1 indicated C1 got upset and banged his own head on the dresser; Special Incident Report indicated that C1 engaged in self injurious behaviors by sitting on the floor next to his dresser and began to bang his head on the dresser handle, his closet door; Interview statement alleged that C1 was upset with S1 and was running towards S1, S1 moved and that was when C1 allegedly hit his head against the dresser. C1\u2019s bump/ bruise on the head is not consistent with what is alleged to have occurred due to the location of the bump/bruise being on the top middle part of his head versus the sides of his head. LPA could not determine whether or not C1 bump/bruise on the head was caused by C1\u2019s alleged self injurious behavior or C1 allegedly running towards S1 and S1 allegedly deflecting resulting in C1 hitting his head on the dresser. LPA could not confirm how C1 obtained the bump/bruise due to inconsistent verbiage on documentation, the incident occurring in C1\u2019s room and only S1 and C1 was in the room, no witnesses to confirm what actually occurred; however, C1 sustained an injury under S1\u2019s care resulting in a hospital visit that confirmed C1 had a head injury. Additionally, facility\u2019s internal investigation was substantiated as evidenced by the injuries sustained by the client under S1\u2019s supervision. Also, based on the photographs taken of the injury and the assessment by the nurse of the wound does not appear to match how the injury could have resulted. In addition, confidential interviews revealed that although C1 does have a history of self injurious behavior, C1 has not been observed hurting himself on the top part/middle of his head where the injury was located. Furthermore, S1 was placed on administrative leave 06/09/2020 and S1\u2019s employment was terminated effective 06/29/2020. Based on the interview statements and documentation obtained, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. Facility cited for Violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22 Division Six, regulation 80078 (a): Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision: The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. Medical Records review, photographs and interviews confirmed that S1 failed to ensure C1\u2019s safety by providing inconsistent statements of what actually occurred and not providing care and supervision that meets C1\u2019s needs resulting in a bump/bruise on C1\u2019s head.
