LPA Larios obtained records from the placing agency pertaining to the date the injury was first observed, 03/09/22. The records revealed a placing agency staff observed superficial scratches on C1\u2019s forehead, not bruising as reported to the Department. On 03/11/22, C1 was taken for medical evaluation. The physician observed cystic acne on C1\u2019s forehead, no bruising was documented.

While it was consistently reported C1 has a tendency to bite his hand, information obtained by LPA Larios indicated C1 was observed hitting his head against, and with objects. There were no identified witnesses to the alleged incident. Based on information gathered through interviews conducted and record review, the allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On 02/10/2022, the Department received a complaint alleging allegations of lack of supervision and personal rights toward one client. It was alleged that client 1 has unexplained bruises, including that his cellular phone was taken away from him while speaking to a family member. The Facility Administrator (FA) including facility staff workers that provided a statement provided consistent statements and denied the allegations. FA reported that clients are not allowed to bring electronics to the table to avoid being distracted when eating. The FA and statements by facility staff stated that they would never take away a phone from a client while having or listening to a person on the phone. In confidential interviews, three clients were unable to provide clear and understandable verbal statements, and therefore no information was brought forth with respect to the allegations reported. The individual identified as other who disclosed some concerns for the focused client could not be contacted, therefore no statement was obtained. However, LA Co. Emergency Response Worker was able to obtain a statement and other corroborated the allegations reported. All professional collateral contacts, such as the county social worker (CSW), Regional Center Services Representative, including representatives from the client's school who are mandated reporters denied any concerns with the care and supervision by the facility staff workers. The school provided reports about the bruising, and it was not caused at the facility. Information obtained in the county reports reads that the City of Montebello Police responded to the facility and denied observing any abuse towards the clients and left the facility without further incident. The interviews obtained in the explanations about the lack of supervision and personal rights violations could not be corroborated. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the above aforementioned for review and signature. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

Interviews revealed no witnesses to the alleged incident and during the time of the alleged incident, Staff member #2 (S2) also present with S1 corroborates C1\u2019s bedroom door was open while S1 was present inside C1\u2019s room. S2 reported no issues or concerns observed. The allegation was also investigated by South Central Los Angeles Regional Center. The case was closed with a finding of 'not supported' as C1 recanted the allegations. The Department of Children and Family Services reported a history of unsupported allegations and determined the allegation to be inconclusive. Records reviewed revealed no past reprimands or incidents of sexual misconduct for S1. Due to a lack of evidence, it has been determined that the allegation is Unsubstantiated at this time meaning, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove or disprove that a violation occurred. Exit Interview conducted with Facility Administrator and a copy of this report and appeal rights are emailed to Administrator and also mailed to Licensee.",

On August 23, 2021, the Department concluded a complaint investigation under this GH. The complaint alleged that Child Care Coordinator #1 (S1) engaged in sexual acts with fifteen-year-old client #1 (C1) (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated September 2, 2021) The confidential interviews and S1 acknowledging performing multiple lewd and lascivious sexual acts, on separate occasions, with C1 were consistent. The allegations were substantiated and the GH was cited under the Title 22 Regulations, Section 84072(d)(11). Based on the analysis of the Fullerton Police report and Licensing Special Investigative Bureau report, the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for the physical abuse of C1. The Penal Code section 288a defines sexual conduct with a minor as physical abuse. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute sexual assault, as defined in the Health and Safety (H&S) code section 1548 (f)(1)(E). The Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,500.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights discussed.

Witness interviews and evidence obtained revealed that C1 has a history of making false allegations and that C1 had a \u201ccrush\u201d on a client residing in a different home. Furthermore, it was reported that children are never allowed in a bedroom unless it\u2019s theirs, that children are properly supervised, and witnesses are adamant the inappropriate touching did not happen between the clients as there was no opportunity. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

LPA informed Administrator that the purpose of this visit was to complete an annual inspection and review records. During the visit, LPA reviewed the disaster preparedness plan, emergency intervention plan, client files, and cash resources. LPA conducted two staff interviews and was unable to interview clients because they are Non-verbal. Records of personnel/ staff members were reviewed to ensure staff meet regulatory requirements. All personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. Personnel Files are maintained on-site in a secure location. Six client files were reviewed. All client files were complete and in a secure location. Administrator informed LPA of the facility's plan to convert to an adult facility, since 50% of the population is now over the age of 18. Facility has one pending age exception request that was submitted in October. Administrator has already obtained her license for adult facilities and will be submitting a request to our department to convert within the coming months. No deficiencies were observed or cited at this time. LPA conducted an exit interview with Rhodora Del Rosario, Administrator, at 2:45 PM. A copy of this report was provided at the completion of this inspection.",

LPA met Facility Manager Arjay Ventura at the facility and Licensee Mark Del Rosario over the phone and informed of the purpose of the visit. Based on confidential interview, record review, and observation, these additional deficiencies were found. It was found that a minor in care was administered 3 doses of robitussin on 3/10, 3/11, and 3/12 and a morning dose on 3/13/24. Per the PRN authorization letter signed by the minor's physician, the physician should have been called about the robitussin after 72 hours if no improvement in condition. The minor had been observed over the course of these dates to be increasingly lethargic. Later that day, the minor was found unresponsive after a nap around 3PM, at which point the minor was transported to the hospital. Per licensee, the minor's neurologist had been consulted about another medication but not the robitussin since the minor had been given it on previous occasions without issue. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80075 Health Related Services. See LIC 809-D. It was found that a resident in care was supplied with a lunch consisting of five bags of chips, a pack of 17 girl scout cookies, a gatorade, a capri sun, and a container of chicken and rice, which was witnessed to be similar to a lunch provided to another resident in care. The LIC 602 Physician's Report for the former resident indicates that the resident's food also needs to be minced. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84076 Food Service. See LIC 809-D.

    "narrative": "On 07/16/24 at 3:00pm, LPA Christine Wilson, LPM Kevin Sauk and CEO Ahron Leftkowich joined in a Teams meeting online. The purpose of the meeting was to gain clarification on the proposed residential use of the ADU location, and the processes CCL utilizes to potentially support an application for a provisional license. LPA Wilson: Is your understanding that you would provide an application for separate licensing of the separate address? CEO, I wasn\u2019t thinking about it in that regard and that is because its connected to the house. Same as a house with a back house and to incorporate it into the existing group home. At the time it seemed the only issue was the fire clearance. There is a separate entrance and three rooms. I wanted to use the space as a therapy room and the larger room as an office. That would free up the current office as a third bedroom. I wanted the same license and just to add the ADU to it. LPM Sauk: This was my understanding also; that you wanted a capacity increase from 4-6. If there is a hypothetical approval to do this, where would staff be stationed during the night shift? CEO: Staff will be in the main house because that is where the bedrooms would be. LPM Sauk: There is no direct access to the ADU from the main home. The ADU would have no bedroom usage? CEO Yes. We do not want clients coming through the office and would not want to have one in the ADU and others in the main house. This office will primarily be used for administrative use, and used as a space for staff to have meetings, and work space. Any staff on shift is on shift in the presence of clients. LPM Sauk: What do you need to do to gain clearance from the City? CEO Label the floorplan as a bedroom, change deadbolt to a handle. I was trying to coordinate between Fire and DSS and I may have gotten the wrong impression as to the use of each room in the house compared to the labeling of the rooms. When it came to the ADU my struggle and hesitation has been around the labeling of the bedroom when I would rather use it as a therapy room. Continues on page 2\n\nPage 2 LPM Sauk: Is there any way to not have a separate address? If we license that, you would have to have two separate facility numbers. CEO: We want to use it for whatever we want to use it for. To remove that address I would have to do a lot of construction to remove the kitchen and further construction to attach it to the main house. We want the current license to be added on to the ADU. It cannot be a separate free-standing group home because of the number of rooms. LPM Sauk: You are not allowed to have meetings and client files in an address that is not licensed by us. What I can do is I can reach out to my supervisor to confirm that it could be the same license number. The fact that it has a separate address is a hurdle. CEO: Its also difficult because we are leasing. LPM Sauk: A suggestion could be, to maybe file for a relocation. It will cost you half of the relocation fees and you can find another property with the number of bedrooms and office space you need. How many clients do you have? CEO: we have no clients at this moment. Our population is teens with mental/behavioral health challenges and offering therapeutic services. We do not deal with addiction. We receive direct referrals from other programs. No one is living on the premises. LPM Sauk: I will reach out to my manager to understand if/how we could license the ADU. We have to see if this is a possibility for licensure or not. LPA Wilson: I will send you a report today, as if we met in person, for your signature. End of meeting 3:32pm",

On May 10, 2023, LPA Rosslyn Gray and Licensing Program Manager, JoAunne Griffin conducted a Case Management-Incident visit in response to the incident report, met with facility representative and obtained related documentation. The investigation, including confidential interviews with facility residents and employees as well as review of facility incident report, program, and protocols, determined a lack of evidence to support neglect or lack of supervision. The interviews revealed the residents felt safe in the facility and there was no concern for neglect or lack of supervision. There was no external factor such as conflict which triggered Y1 to elope from the facility. The staff members attempted to talk with Y1 and encourage Y1 to remain in the facility; however, their efforts were unsuccessful, and Y1 left the facility without warning on May 8, 2023, at approximately 10:00 PM. The facility was operating within approved staff to client ratios at the time of the incident. --(Continued on page LIC809-C)--\n\nBased on employee interviews and the written report submitted by the facility the staff member followed the facility elopement policy. Y1 left the facility on their own free will and went onto the freeway where Y1 was struck by a vehicle. The staff called 911 immediately when Y1 eloped and reported the elopement as per facility policy. Based on confidential statements and documentary evidence, the investigation findings concerning neglect/lack of supervision are determined unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On 6/29/2022 at 11:15AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Selena Hood conducted an unannounced visit to the above licensed facility. The purpose of the visit is to conduct the required annual inspection. LPA met with Phyllis Meagher, CEO, and Alisha Eipp, HR Coordinator at the facility office at 11:35AM. LPA conducted a review of ten staff files. LPA conducted an interview with 1 staff member. The facility is in the process of putting files digitally. There were some documents missing from the staff files, but the facility was able to provide the documentation before the end of the inspection. LPA reviewed the emergency binder, which documented the training plan, emergency contacts, and quarterly emergency drills. LPA observed that the office was organized and in good repair. At 2:10PM, LPA Hood went to the facility grounds at 3192 Glen Canyon Rd. Scotts Valley, CA 95066. LPA was met by Ty Newcomb, Director of Facility Operations and Lydia Beall, Administrator. LPA, Director of Facility Operations, and Licensee conducted a walk through of the grounds. The facility had a current census of seventeen resident youth. The grounds include both adolescent and adult treatment centers, but the facility has multiple ways to keep the populations separated. The facility currently has female residents in the lower unit and male residents in the upper unit. LPA observed all rooms, bathrooms, common eating area, outdoor gym, outdoor pool, and kitchen. LPA observed that the pool had a fence over five feet tall. All chemicals and cleaning supplies are kept behind locked closets. Due to the nature of the residents' needs at this facility, staff also keep personal items such as mouthwash that may contain alcohol locked in the staff offices as well.\n\nThe facility has cooks which provide three meals and two snack times for the residents. LPA observed a posted menu and sufficient amounts of food in the kitchen. LPA measured water temperature in the bathroom of the male \"suite\" unit, which measured 111 degrees which is appropriate. LPA observed the facility to be clean, tidy, and in good repair. During the inspection, LPA observed that the facility had Naloxone in multiple places in the facility in locked first aid kits. The medical unit did have prescriptions on file for some residents as well as a statement about the use of Naloxone. LPA will follow up with a case management with the Health Assistant Director, Hillary Brandt, regarding training that staff have received on Naloxone. LPA was assisted by Lydia Beall, Administrator, in receiving the resident roster and client files. LPA observed the emergency binder which contained a face sheet for all of the residents with their names, authorized representatives, current medications, and physicians names. Of the seventeen residents, six of the residents had been at the facility for longer than thirty days. LPA reviewed the six residents files. LPA also reviewed the immunization records, medication logs, and medication binders which are kept in a separate health office on the grounds. LPA did not interview any residents at this time. All residents present had legal guardians or authorized parents, so LPA would need to ask permission from their guardian's before speaking with the residents. LPA did not observe any Title 22 deficiencies during this inspection. Due to the different offices, LPA conducted an exit interview via phone call with Phyllis Meagher, CEO, at 4:49PM. LPA will provide this report to CEO virtually to sign and return.",

Staff were not informed nor observed any sexual activity between C1 and other clients. Interviews produced no additional alleged victims or witnesses to the alleged abuse. As to claims that staff failed to prevent drugs in the facility, the investigation revealed that C1 and other client at the facility would at time smuggle illegal drugs into the facility after they returned from home visits. Clients were also suspected of using the internet to purchase narcotics and have them delivered by the facility\u2019s fence area and sidewalk. It was revealed, due to client\u2019s personal rights, staff were not able to search clients who were suspected of possibly being involved in drug activity. The investigation did not produce any independent witnesses to the allegation. Observations of the facility physical plant during the investigation on unannounced complaint inspections, found facility grounds in substantial compliance. The facility was observed overall to be clean and or orderly. On site inspections produced no deficiencies concerning a lack of cleanliness. Due to a lack of evidence, the allegations can not be substantiated at this time. Although the allegations may have happened or may be valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove or disprove the allegations occurred; therefore, the allegations are determined Unsubstantiated. There were no deficiencies cited during the investigation. Exit interview conducted; appeal rights discussed and a copy of this report will be emailed to Facility Administrator.",

Barnes-Woodard met with Lupe Rodriguez to deliver findings on the above allegation(s). Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Enrique Hernandez and Associate Governmental Program Analyst (AGPA) Tonya L. Barnes-Woodard conducted the investigation into the above allegations. LPA Hernandez conducted the initial 10-day complaint inspection on February 25, 2022 and conducted confidential interviews with three staff. AGPA Woodard conducted subsequent visits to the facility on April 8, 2022 and May 20, 2022; confidential interviews were conducted with three staff members, and one client. Additional phone interviews were conducted on May 20th, 21st, and June 15th, 2022. Confidential interviews revealed that there are two staff present for each shift, including NOC. The day of the incident there were two staff on shift. While staff person was being attacked by four clients, one client blindsided staff and punched staff in the face. In return, Staff punched one of the boy\u2019s in their chest who was not the alleged victim. In interview with the minor who was punched in the chest, minor didn\u2019t disclose the attack against staff or that he was punched by staff but referenced another staff member who swung on the alleged victim. The alleged victim has a history of verbally going after staff as well as physically assaulting staff and people in the community. After staff didn\u2019t receive any support from other staff member at the facility, staff gathered his items and left the facility to report the incident to the police, leaving the staff person with five clients temporarily until additional staff arrived. Based on confidential interviews and review of supportive documentation, the Staff member admitted to hitting a minor in self-defense when he was being attacked by four minors, and leaving the facility to report it with Law Enforcement, which left one staff alone with five clients, therefore the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the personal rights and lack of supervision allegations are substantiated.

LPA David Torres and LPM Angela King did not observe documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. There are no deficiencies cited at this time.

C3 got up and began chasing C1, caught him and pinned him against the facility van. Staff separated the boys. C1 then proceeded to vandalize staff (S8)\u2019s vehicle. L/E arrived and attempted to de-escalate the situation. C1 was given a citation for vandalism. C1 was assessed and transported to the hospital by emergency services. According to the \u2018Patient Visit Information\u2019 sheet, C1 was assessed for a closed head injury, cervical strain, and left knee contusion; SIR stated C1 required medical treatment for hurt left knee, head injury, cervical strain and headache from emotional state, and other documentation states C1 was transported to the hospital to tend to a hurt ankle by running and was checked out at the hospital for his neck and knee hurting. According to citation (A448614) the date of violation was 05/25/21 at 1637 (approximately 4:37 PM). C1 was released at 6:30AM and returned back to the facility by Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy and Child Welfare Social Worker. There is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations occurred, therefore the Department has decided that the allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "continued from 9099 (Substantiated findings) It was also reported that the facility is severely understaffed, and that upper management hire unqualified staff and lie about their credentials, saying that a master\u2019s student (MFT) is a licensed therapist, and that the Head of Services and MFT are providing services, which are not actually being provided. The Facility Administrator provided documentation that the staff performing the duties as a Residential Therapist was an Associate Marriage & Family Therapist. In other interviews another staff (S2) was asked to be the Residential Therapist, however declined, due to not yet being licensed. Therefore, the Department has determined that the above allegations to be Substantiated, meaning that the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left at the facility.\n\ncontinued from 9099-A (unsubstantiated findings) During confidential interviews conducted with clients and staff, and a review of supportive documentation that was obtained, there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. In statements from staff, a client (PC1) was triggered when they heard a staff make a comment about them being gay which resulted in the client destroying property (no record of SIR). In other interviews it was reported that they never heard staff speak inappropriately about a youth. Staff will put gas in the vehicle and air in the tires. The facility van was terrible and didn\u2019t have a rearview mirror. In other staff interviews, the Facility Administrator brought a mechanic to fix it. Eventually the facility had a new car, but then there was an accident and they changed cars. Staff will hear of 14-day notices but were never part of the conversation and are unsure if clients were present. Staff reported false statements and/or documentation such as fake Covid 19 test results to say negative from previous Head of Services and false documentation where the facility manager wrote in an SIR that a client attacked a staff with a spatula when it was a knife/blade 8-10\u201d long and gave statements to police as an eye witness to events when she was in the office with the door closed. During confidential interviews regarding a misuse of funds, no statements were given about issues that occurred last year. There is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations occurred in April 2021, therefore, the Department has decided that the allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "continued from page 1 (LIC 9099) C6 has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and has been caught with drug paraphernalia in his room and/or personal property. CDE did not provide adequate supervision when C6 and client (C9) were placed off-site at a motel during the time the facility was going through renovations and being repaired; this is evident by the change of motel due to clients smoking marijuana in the room and on the property by the pool. During a room check at 2:30AM, staff noticed C6 was not in the room. It was also reported that when staff (S3) left the clients in the room and went to the restroom somewhere outside of the room, and upon S3's return, S3 was locked out, and could not get back in. There were conflicting stories as to whether staff stayed in the motel room with the two clients or stayed outside the door. SIR dated 08/08/2021 states that staff (S5) took C6 and C9 to the facility to pick up more clothes. S5 stayed in the vehicle with C6, while C9 was allowed to enter the facility during the time construction workers were doing renovations. Upon entering the facility, C9 was upset that his belongings were dirty and blamed construction workers. C9 became enraged and destroyed facility property as well as power tools. The Facility Administrator (FA) requested that clients be taken off-site between August 4, 2021 to August 8, 2021 during the time the facility was being repaired. FA provided the repair list which included: painting the inside of the house, fixing the broken cabinets and adding granite, updating flooring, adding new cabinetry in the hallway, fixing both bathrooms, adding new appliances and furniture in client's rooms, and adding an extension for a new therapy room. The repairs took longer than expected, and the clients did not return until August 17, 2021. continue on page 3 (LIC 9099C)\n\ncontinued from page 2 (LIC 9099C) Based on interviews and supporting documentation, although the bathrooms were repaired, the toilets sometimes didn't work; plumbing was backed-up/clogged and clients had to go to the gas station down the street to use the restroom or would go to the backyard. Based on recordings on C6's cellphone, the Deputy Probation Officer (DPO) viewed recordings of the facility having incomplete repairs, lacking furniture, and C6 pouring water into the tank to flush the toilet. DPO also observed incomplete construction on the back patio and a video of clients jokingly placing their arm under the blade and stating that it could cause an injury. Through AGPAs investigation it was noted that the completed construction occurred in late October/early November 2021, however during a heavy rain in December, the ceiling collapsed in both room additions. AGPA Woodard verified that building permits were not pulled for the alterations to the facility. C6 has a standing appointment in person at the clinic every Tuesday at 10:30AM with the Behavioral Health Clinician (BHC). Both the facility staff and C6 are aware. In the month of July 2021, C6 last attended therapy on July 6th. On July 13th, the BHC walked into the lobby to see if C6 was there for his regularly scheduled appointment. BHC called the facility and spoke with staff (S4), who stated that C6 had to work. S4 was informed on July 13th that C6 has not been participating in therapy and there were no future appointments scheduled or contact made by group home staff or C6. BHC states that therapy sessions were cancelled on July 13th, 20th, and 27th. On August 13th, 2021 C6 had a medication appointment with psychiatrist (DR). DR shared with BHC that the follow-up was done by phone instead of in-person per the group homes manager's request due to the facility remodel. DR phoned S4 and S4 reported that C6 was taking a shower and not available for an interview. continue on page 4 (LIC 9099-C)\n\ncontinued from page 3 There have been ongoing concerns with Casa De Esperanza not providing adequate supervision, concerns with their lack of communication with the Department, Placement Agencies, and Behavioral Health, as well as their ability to ensure clients in placement are receiving needed services in a timely manner. Therefore, the Department has determined the above allegations are substantiated, meaning that the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The following deficiencies have been cited. (See LIC 9099D)\n\ncontinued from page 1 (LIC 9099A) Therefore, the Department has decided that the above allegation is unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

LPA met with Assistant Director of Residential Services (ADS) and the Facility Clinic Manager (FCM). This case-management-incident inspection was conducted due to the Department receiving a serious incident report (SIR) reflecting that on 02/11/2024 Youth (C1) missed 3pm Lithium 450 MG due to medication not being packed by the facility nurse (S1). LPA reviewed the relevant documents and confirmed that staff did not provide medication. LPA Wilson inquired about reason for missed medication. Per the Facility Clinic Manager, there is a new nurse who was right at her 90-day probationary period and she may not have been aware of the need to pack the medication at that time. Normally the 4pm nurse arrives and gives the 3pm medications. There was no nurse on that day so that window was missed. There is a board with the in-between medications listed and she needs to check the board where they shifts are covered and medications written. While she has been on there has been no need for packing. The new nurse was shadowing the regular nurses during her probationary period. LPA and FCM discussed the deficiency and a plan of correction. A type B (1) deficiency will be cited today. See LIC809D for details. A copy of this report was discussed with ADS and a copy of this report was left at the facility",

Confidential interviews stated the facility conducts searches of children when they arrive at the facility and are supervised by staff. Confidential interviews and documents reviewed revealed though staff supervise children, staff are not allowed to supervise children while in the restroom and shower. Confidential interviews revealed that staff was not aware C1 was ingesting an illegal drug because no one ever told staff. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegation that due to a lack of supervision a youth is using illegal drugs in the facility may have occurred; however, it is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were emailed to the facility representative for signature. The original signed report will be placed in the facility file.",

    "narrative": "On July 14, 2023, at 12:30PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carrie Palmer conducted an unannounced Case Management visit with the above facility and met with Program Manager, Kelly Gonderman and Samuel Edman. The purpose of the visit is to follow up on a Case Management concerning information received regarding one client being inappropriately touched by another client over the clothes and kissing. On June 5, 2023, LPA conducted an in-person interview with Program Director Kelly Gonderman at Center for Discovery- Whitter. LPA Palmer asked the Program Director to explain her understanding of what happened. The Program Director stated on two separate occasions, that other clients distracted a teacher while clients were playing in the milieu. While the teacher was distracted, C1 (See confidential names list dated 7/14/23) leaned over to kissed C2. Further, the Program Director stated during school time, someone distracted the teacher and C1 touched C2 over the clothes. The Program Director shared that C1 was discharged from the facility, the day the kissing was reported and later C2 was interviewed by a sheriff. The Program Director shared that C2 was touched over the clothes at the table in the milieu and the kissing happened someplace else. The Program Director shared that after C1 left, C2 spoke to a staff member about what happened. The staff member shared with C2 that she should not be kissing boys and allowing them to touch her in private places because that is the number one rule for getting in trouble at the facility. The Program Director was unable to share the exact number of staff in the room for either of the instances, but stated there were approximated between 5-10 staff or less. On June 19, 2023, LPA Palmer met with C2. C2 stated the inappropriate touching and kissing happened on different days, both at the facility sometime in the early or middle of May. C2 shared, the first time she was touched over the clothes was on a Monday or a Tuesday, but she didn\u2019t report it to\n\nanyone until Friday. Per C2, on the following Monday, C1 kissed C2. This was the first day C1 and C2 did not sit together. C2 stated 3 other clients were siting at the table when the inappropriate touching happened, but C2 is unsure of the staff that were present because staff change daily. C2 reported, C2 being backed up against the wall when being kissed, which is how the kiss was able to happen, but C2 stated she moved out of the way because the tongue kiss was unpleasant. C2 stated, the kiss took place in the foyer. C2, elaborated; there are rooms and bathrooms in that area and no staff were present. C2 stated they were away from staff for about 5 minutes. On Monday, June 19, 2023, LPA Palmer interviewed a staff member (S1). The staff member stated, C2 wanted to talk about big track vs. green track. C2 also wanted to talk about C1. The staff member states C2 reported during the check in that all the clients on big track don\u2019t like her because of the kissing. The staff member also reported that C2 stated, she didn\u2019t kiss C1, but that C1 kissed her. The staff member stated, this conversation happened one day before or the day that C1 left. The staff member did not speak to C1 about the incident and did not report it to her supervisor. She only placed the information in her shift notes. The staff member states, in situations like this, there is no policy or procedure stating we must report to the supervisor. On June 23, 2023 LPA Palmer conducted a follow up visit to the facility to interview C2. C2 was able to show LPA the area where the kissing occurred, and the inappropriate touching occurred. LPA Palmer observed that the inappropriate touching happened in an open space, but the kissing happened in a secluded area away from the community areas of the facility. During this observation, the Program Director was also present. On 7/12/2023, LPA Palmer spoke to a family member of C2. C2 told her family member she was assaulted but didn\u2019t want to talk about it in detail. The family member stated, she looked distressed but wasn\u2019t crying. Based on the observations, interviews, and record review a citation was issued. The licensee did not, provide the appropriate care and supervision as necessary to meet the needs of the child, which poses an immediate risk to the Health and Safety or Personal Rights to clients in care. LPA was unable to interview C1. A copy of this report, LIC 809D and Appeal Rights were provided to the facility representative.",

The facility then reported the incident to the victim's authorized representative but did not report the incident to the police and instead advised the authorized representative to contact the police. When the police responded to the facility, staff initially did not permit the victim to be interviewed by the police until the authorized representative approved the interview, despite the police responding due to the authorized representative contacting the police, per the facility's direction. Additionally, four staff indicated they were unfamiliar with a suspected child abuse report (SCAR).

    "narrative": "Based on interviews and record review, it is unclear how R1 obtained the pods, but R1 reported to have obtained them by picking a lock and pulling the container open. However, LPA was not able to speak to R1 directly to confirm this. The facility does not keep a record of when residents do their laundry or which staff is assigned to supervise, and staff reported that they do not know which staff would have been on shift when R1 obtained the pods. The facility\u2019s system is to have residents assigned a color corresponding to a day of the week, based on their day of admission, and on their day of the week, they wash, dry, and put away their laundry. Due to this lack of record keeping, it cannot be determined how R1 obtained the laundry pods. The laundry pods were kept locked but were accessible to residents during laundry time. If R1 obtained the pods during laundry time, it is possible that R1 was not supervised well enough, allowing R1 to grab one or two in excess or grab them and not place in the washer and then hide them on R1\u2019s person to later hide in R1\u2019s room. If R1 obtained the laundry pods outside of laundry time, it is possible that during a lapse of supervision, R1 was able to break into the laundry pod container. The facility has since improved their laundry procedure to keep laundry pods locked at all times and ensure staff supervise more carefully, including having staff access the laundry pods themselves for the youth rather than youth grabbing them themselves. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. The facility is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84065.2 Personnel Duties. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Executive Director Rob Ayala, Administrator Britney Gay, Facility Manager Sara Stokes, Regulatory Affairs Coordinator Jin Kim, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA.",

Due to COVID-19 social distancing orders, this visit was scheduled as a tele-visit. During the investigation, LPA Hawkins conducted confidential interviews with program staff and victim R1\u2019s (See LIC 811 Confidential Names) therapists and authorized representative and reviewed R1\u2019s records and staff shift note related to the incident. Based on interviews and record review, R1 obtained two laundry pods, stored them in R1\u2019s drawer, and ingested them at night while in their room. R1 was feeling upset and showed them to R1\u2019s roommate as R1 swallowed one pod. The roommate immediately informed staff S1, who called 911. S1 had offered to counsel R1 earlier in the day, after noticing that R1 seemed \u201coff,\u201d but R1 refused the meeting with S1.",

LPA met with Program Director Virginia Parish, who helped facilitate this inspection. Currently in care are 3 ambulatory clients. During this visit, LPA toured the home inside and out. The home has 4 client bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, and 3 therapists offices. No bodies of water. All walkways are unobstructed. The home is well lit and equipped with comfortable furnishings. LPA observed 3 fire extinguishers, all of which were inspected on 03/28/2022. Carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are located throughout the house. Smoke detectors were tested and are functional. The thermostat was set to 70 degrees upon arrival. In the kitchen, LPA observed at least 2 days of perishable food and at least 7 days of nonperishable food. The kitchen was clean and free from hazards. Sharps are kept locked away from client access. LPA toured the backyard and front yard on the property. The front yard has an enclosed courtyard which has a table and chairs for client leisure. There is a non-operational fire place in the courtyard that is closed by a glass cover. One non-operational fireplace in the living room as well. The backyard surrounds the home on 2 sides, and is enclosed by a wooden fence on all sides. LPA observed 3-4 boards which had come loose in a recent wind storm, and the facility will be submitting a work order to their handyman today 04/27/2022. Facility will send proof of this fix to LPA once it is completed. During this visit, LPA inspected 3 client files. All files were in order with required documentation. One client's admission agreement is missing authorized representative signature, but it is noted this form was sent for signature and has not been returned. LPA Mariah Hawkins will return on another day to inspect staff files, med count, and conduct interviews with staff and clients. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to the facility for their records.",

The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80078 Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. See attached LIC 9099-D. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Program Director Virginia Parish, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.\n\n... the full movie was shown or that residents have felt traumatized/re-traumatized by media at the facility. Additionally, a book on the Wicca faith was read by R1 while in care, but it could not be determined how the youth obtained the book, and staff named as the one who brought it in and approved it denied doing so, stating, as supported by the plan of operation and staff statements, that they are not the one responsible for approving books and would not have done so. The facility removed the book upon authorized representative\u2019s request. The facility policy is to have the therapist and/or facility manager approve media (books, movies) available to clients while in care. However, the facility does not keep a list of already approved books or movies nor of movies or media shown to residents. LPA advises, as best practice, that the facility consider maintaining a list of approved films and books and/or maintain a log of films shown on movie nights. Based on the report, the allegation \u201cFacility not meeting minor's educational needs\u201d pertains to resident R1 not completing homework while in treatment. Based on interviews and record review, R1 was not completing all homework assignments, but was completing treatment goals. R1 was allowed to schedule therapy sessions during homework blocks, but 20 hours are provided a week for homework completion. In the remainder of that time, R1 did not complete all homework assignments. Staff statements indicate that, as a short-term treatment program, the program prioritizes patients\u2019/residents' well-being and treatment goals. The program plan of operation provides that completing homework is a house rule, but staff statements indicate that staff cannot force patients to complete homework. Based on the report, the allegation \u201cFacility not following admission agreement\u201d pertains to R1 not receiving 24/7 supervision, as stated in the parent welcome packet provided at admission. Based on interviews and record review, R1 was to receive 24/7 care and be checked at least every 15 minutes. The parent welcome packet provides for four phases with different supervision requirements and privileges. R1 achieved a higher phase and was dropped according to behaviors. Following R1\u2019s suicide attempt, supervision was enhanced. Additionally, shift notes indicate staff were attentive to R1, and R1\u2019s statements indicate that R1\u2019s incidents occurred in part specifically in brief moments when staff turned around and that R1 felt comfortable talking to staff about their treatment goals. The investigation found that there was a lack of supervision resulting in residents engaging in sexual behaviors at the facility, but it could not be determined that a lack of supervision resulted in other violations.\n\nAlthough the allegations may have happened or are valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with residents, staff, and witnesses, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegations are Unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Program Director Virginia Parish, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Administrator Sara Stokes and informed of the purpose of the visit. The CARE inspection tool was used to complete this inspection. During visit, LPA conducted interviews with two staff and two residents and toured the facility site. LPA verified that everyone on the staff schedule has a background clearance reflected on Guardian. LPA observed that the facility was clean, organized, and pathways free of obstructions or hazards. There are no bodies of water. The kitchen was fully stocked with a varied supply of food within date. Bathrooms were sanitary. Bedrooms have clean linens and ample storage space. Hot water temperature measured within permitted range. LPA observed that there are seven beds, three double-occupancy bedrooms and one single-occupancy bedroom. Administrator stated the extra bed is to better accommodate youth with different needs or different gender identities and that the facility has not used the bed to exceed the capacity. LPA advised that the facility cannot have more beds than the licensed capacity and advised either removing the bed in the single-occupancy room or removing the second bed in the room next to it, as these are the two smaller rooms and share a bathroom. A continuation visit will be required to complete the personnel file review. The LIC 311B was provided for the future to allow the licensee to consider different methods for ensuring these forms, which the licensee maintains but which are not all easily accessible during licensing visits, are available for future visits. For the continuation visit, LPA requested the following be consolidated in a printed or electronic format that is ready for review by LPA for staff S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names): LIC 501 or resume; LIC 503 or health screening and TB test results; LIC 508 criminal record statement; LIC 9108 mandated reporter statement; LIC 9052 employee rights; initial training documentation; annual/continued training, including intervention/de-escalation training, with verification of hours received and training certificates, for no less...\n\n... than the last 12 months; CPI certificate; and first aid certificate.

Per the NCC terms, the following was to be completed: (2) to ensure staff were fully trained, per applicable regulations, at hire and additionally on no less than a quarterly basis; (3) to designate two overnight staff each night with at least one being a facility manager, meeting this requirement by March 13, 2023; (4) to designate an administrator to oversee only one facility, meeting this requirement by March 13, 2023; (5) to revise the plan of operation / program statement (POO/PS) and/or develop an addendum to include discussion of the use and purpose of motion sensors in the facility, meeting this requirement by March 13, 2023; (6) to provide notification of desire to utilize technical support program (TSP) services by January 25, 2023; and (7), if desired, submitting a central administrative facility waiver by January 25, 2023. See the notes by the corresponding number below. (2) During the visit, LPA reviewed staff training and interviewed staff. Interviews and training records reflect that trainings are conducted at monthly staff meetings and include the topics of supervision, de-escalation, and reporting requirements. Staff interviewed were knowledgeable of facility procedures, and resident reports support appropriate staff supervision. (3) LPA obtained a current LIC 500. The facility has designated two staff for each night. There is at least one facility manager on each night shift. The facility is conducting 15-minute bed check rounds during the night, and staff log and sign off on each check for each resident. The logs were available for LPA's review, and LPA observed checks each night. LPA advises that staff sign/initial at each check rather than drawing a line down the page to indicate no change, as better verification of separate checks. [CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE]\n\n(4) The facility had a candidate for the administrator role who ended up leaving the organization. Another candidate has been hired but still needs to complete administrator training. (5) LPA has not received a POO/PS addendum or revision. LPA is granting one extension. The revision/addendum to meet the requirement as stated above and in the NCC report provided to the licensee is requested to be submitted no later than May 1, 2023. (6) The licensee was referred for TSP services. (7) The licensee has decided to not request a central administrative facility waiver at this time. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was left with Administrator Sara Stokes, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Administrator Carolyn Williams and explained the purpose of the visit. As outlined in the NCC terms and previous inspections, several requirements were reviewed. Staff training records showed compliance, with all staff fully trained at the time of hire and receiving additional training on a quarterly basis. The Administrator agreed to submit an updated LIC 500 along with specific documents for all Staff, including LIC 501 forms, First Aid and CPI training certifications, and current training records for the past 12 months, by end of today. Overnight staffing requirements have been met consistently, with two staff members present each night, including at least one facility manager. Bed check logs were complete and organized, though some discrepancies were noted. The Administrator clarified these issues and described the corrective actions taken promptly. Regarding administrative oversight, the facility has transitioned leadership roles. The former administrator has been promoted, and the previous lead facility manager has assumed the administrator position. Carolyn Williams passed the Administrator exam on 11/27/24 and now is a certified Administrator. LPA reviewed the facility\u2019s overall compliance over the past quarter. Although no reports requiring follow-up had been submitted, it was discovered during the inspection that some reportable incidents had occurred in recent months. These were determined to be high-priority incidents that could require a follow-up. LPA provided guidance on proper reporting procedures and requirements and was assured by Administrator that the incident reports will be submitted by tomorrow. Facility is being cited for violation of California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 5, Section 80061(b)(1).\n\nThe facility has received two complaints, but no deficiencies in the past quarter. One deficiency was cited during todays inspection. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was provided to Administrator, Carolyn Williams.",

    "narrative": "On 7/24/25, Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Jonathan Medina and Omar Sawyer conducted a quarterly case management inspection in accordance with the terms agreed upon during the January 2023 Noncompliance Conference (NCC). LPAs met with Administrator Carolyn Williams and explained the purpose of the visit. The NCC visits were extended for an additional two quarters due to continued non-compliance observed between April and June. As outlined in the NCC terms and during previous inspections, several requirements were reviewed. Documents observed on this visit indicated compliance, with all staff receiving the required training at the time of hire and additional training on a quarterly basis. LPAs reviewed an updated LIC 500 and supporting documentation for three staff\u2014including LIC 501 forms, First Aid and CPI certifications, and current training records for the past 12 months. All other staff were already reviewed in a recent annual facility inspection completed on 5/15/2025 meeting this quarters requirements. Overnight staffing requirements have been consistently met, with two staff members present during each overnight shift, including one facility manager. During review of the June schedule, LPAs observed the use of nurses to cover staff ratio requirements. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the use of the nurse registry is being correctly implemented at the facility. Bed check logs were reviewed and found to be complete and organized. Although there were some discrepancies in the physical folder, proof that bed check rounds were conducted was found in the digital bed check log. Regarding administrative oversight, Carolyn Williams passed the Administrator examination on 11/27/24 and is now a certified Administrator. Administrator was confirmed to be only working at one home and meet the 20hr requirement of being at the home as reviewed on staff schedules. Continues on LIC809-C\n\nLPAs reviewed the facility\u2019s overall compliance over the past quarter. In recent months, the facility has experienced multiple compliance issues, particularly related to reporting requirements, staff conduct, adherence to the facility\u2019s Plan of Operation, and one instance of lack of supervision. On 1/13/2025, during a prior NCC visit, the facility was cited for failing to report unusual incidents. This deficiency was discovered during LPA\u2019s review of facility records. During the initial annual inspection conducted on 4/30/2025, the facility was cited for failing to develop Needs and Services Plans for the clients reviewed, and one client was found to be missing a TB test. On 5/5/2025, a complaint was received alleging that staff made inappropriate comments to a minor. This allegation was substantiated. On 5/12/2025, another complaint was filed alleging that staff spoke inappropriately to a minor in care. This allegation was also substantiated. Both complaints involved the same staff member, who has since been terminated. The related deficiencies were promptly addressed and cleared. On 5/14/2025, during the investigation of another complaint, LPAs discovered through confidential interviews that significant incidents had not been reported. As a result, a civil penalty was issued for a repeat deficiency related to reporting requirements. The home was referred to TSP services with Selena Hood and completed a training on reporting requirements and mandated reporting. LPA Medina observed that incident reporting had significantly improved following the TSP training. On 5/29/2025, the facility received two substantiated complaint allegations. The first stated that staff did not ensure a minor received therapy sessions. The second stated that staff forced minors to clean hazardous materials. Additionally, during the continuation of the annual inspection on 5/15/2025, LPA identified deficiencies related to the frequency of therapy sessions being provided. Staff interviews and client statements confirmed that only one individual and one family therapy session per week were being conducted. However, per the facility\u2019s Plan of Operation, each client is to receive two to three individual therapy sessions and two family therapy sessions per week. The facility is currently working on submitting an updated Plan of Operation to reflect the revised therapy schedule. Lastly, on 6/02/2025, the facility received a complaint alleging that the facility failed to provide supervision sufficient to meet clients' needs. This allegation was substantiated. The staff member involved in the incident has since been terminated and deficiency cleared immediately. All Plans of Corrections (POCs) for the above deficiencies have been cleared, with the exception of the updated Plan of Operation, which is still under review by LPA. Three confidential client interviews were conducted, and staff interview data has already been collected during the recent annual inspection. No deficiencies were observed on todays visit. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights were discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Administrator Carolyn Williams.",

LPA met with the facility administrator, Carolyn Williams. At time of arrival, four staff members and four clients were present. The incident report in review was submitted regarding an incident that occurred on July 15th, 2025. According to the report, a client had refused to relinquish a butter knife and held the knife in a threatening manner towards staff. Staff intervened and the client tossed away the knife and attempted to self-regulate in their room. Staff maintained Line of Sight watch on client while giving space to self-regulate. Client expressed ideation to physically harm staff and thus law enforcement was contacted, placing the client on a psychiatric hold. A few days after returning from hold, the client was discharged from the facility. LPA conducted two staff interviews, including an interview with the staff member directly involved in the incident, and one client interview. LPA took pictures of the drawer where utensils are stored. Based off interviews, it was determined staff reacted appropriately to protect the health and safety of clients in care, staff, and the dysregulated client. No deficiencies were observed or cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left with the facility.",

Records reviewed indicated that C1 did fall on the ground, however, due to C1 being unable to verbally communicate with LPA, it is unknown if S6 caused C1 to fall to the ground. C1 was seen by a nurse that did not observe any marks or bruises. There were no witnesses to the alleged incident. Thus, confidential interviews did not corroborate the allegation with a preponderance of evidence. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed the allegation that S6 physically attacked C1 while in care, which may have occurred, however, it is not supported or proven by the evidence. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was reviewed with Anna Liang.

Confidential interviews also denied that C1 had received a fracture on their leg due to a lack of supervision. According to confidential information, fracture was observed in C1\u2019s leg after C1 was taken to be seen by a physician after the facility had reported C3 abusing C2. According to confidential interviews, C1 and C2\u2019s County Social Worker requested to have both children medically evaluated after C3 had been observed by staff and security footage, physically abusing C1 and C2 during a feeding session. Regarding allegation of C2 not being properly fed while in care, confidential interviews stated that although C2 had arrived underweight to their facility, C2 had managed to gain some weight during the approximate 2 months that they had lived at this facility. While other confidential information received by Licensing Office stated that these allegations had occurred. IB investigator and LPA Mena were unable to interview C1 and C2 due to their young age and limited verbal ability. There were no other known witnesses to these allegations. Based on confidential information obtained during the course of this investigation, the allegations that that Child #2 (C2) is not being properly fed and sustained a fracture while in care, and of a lack of supervision resulting in Child # 1 (C1) being slapped while in care, as well as staff not seeking timely medical attention for C1 and C2, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an announced tele Pre-Licensing visit to the home on 1/13/21 at 9:00 AM and met with Licensees, Desiree Clifton and Christine Quiruz and administrator John Tarawali. This visit is being conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams due to COVID-19 restrictions currently in place at this time. LPA toured the facility inside and out and observed the following items: LPA observed that none of the necessary COVID-19 are currently posted and LPA offered to provide the necessary postings at the conclusion of the Pre-Licensing visit. Licensee showed LPA a mass COVID disaster binder that the facility has prepared for COVID procedures for staff and visitors. Licensee states that prior to entering the facility, all visitors and staff will be required to take their temperatures and document their daily temperatures in their binder upon entry. Near the front door, LPA observed a single occupancy bedroom that had a single bed, bedding including mattress cover, fitted sheet, top sheet and blanket, dresser, night stand, lamp, chair and closet area. Carbon Monoxide detector is on the first floor near the client bedroom and a gaming area is near the front entrance of the facility and has a couple of small gaming chairs and television. First level bathroom was observed and is equipped with a shower and tub with glass sliding doors and a shower curtain for privacy. LPA observed that the bathroom had hand sanitizer, soap and paper towels for client use. LPA did suggest that the facility mount the paper towels in the bathroom to avoid them getting into the toilet and causing issues. LPA did have the licensee turn the water on in the bathroom and flush the toilet to verify that there is running water.\n\nLPA observed the thermostat in the hallway and did observe that the current temperature of the home was 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the home. LPA observed an activity area in the main seating and kitchen area of the facility and this activity area was equipped with a giant Jenga game, computer, books and magazines, remote control cars, coloring pages with crayons, colored pencils, markers and sketch pads, microphone for karaoke activities, card games and charades for kids game, puzzles and an extra table in the middle of the room that can be removed for other activities not requiring a table. LPA observed that the dining area is off of the kitchen and the table is set up for placement of four clients. Licensee states that the dining table has a plate where snacks for the clients are going to be kept for access to clients when they desire. LPA observed that there is a fire extinguisher in the dining area but that there is no inspection tab on the fire extinguisher. Licensee states that they got an email from the inspector that it is fine the way it is since it was just purchased. LPA did advise that they were informed that they are to look for the inspection tab on the extinguishers and that they should follow up about this. LPA observed a gas fire place in the living room area of the facility and Licensee reports that this is a gas fireplace and that the gas has been disabled so it will never be used in the facility. LPA observed that the kitchen area is located off the dining and living room area of the facility and that the kitchen area had the stove, microwave built in, refrigerator, double oven and pantry with no lock on the door. Inside the pantry, LPA observed plenty of non-perishable food items at this time. LPA also observed some food items in the refrigerator but food items are very limited at this time as Licensees were advised that perishables were not required during the pre-licensing visit. LPA observed that sharps are to be kept in a drawer in the kitchen and this drawer is secured by a magnetic locking system. LPA did advise the facility that storage of the magnet to release the lock cannot be kept on the refrigerator or anywhere that clients would have access. Chemicals are to be stored under the kitchen sink and this lock is also the magnetic locking system. Licensee reports that the facility will have a land line telephone service at the facility as well as a house cell phone in an effort to protect client medical information when taking clients to medical appointments. Licensee states that she does not want the staff to have any personal information related to the clients on their personal cell phones so when taking clients to appointments, they will be required to take the house cell phone.\n\nLPA observed that the medications are to be stored in the closet by the front door, under the stair case leading to the second story of the facility. This closet has the first aid kit and other first aid supplies as well as cubbies to hold client medications. LPA also observed a small refrigerator in this closet that will also house medications that need refrigeration for clients in care. LPA observed that this closet has a locking door and will not be accessible to clients in care. LPA did advise the Licensee to remove all over the counter medications that come with the first aid kit to ensure that no clients can obtain or have access to these medications. Licensee took LPA to the second story of the facility and LPA did observe that there is a laundry room in the landing area of the upstairs. The laundry room is located next to the bathroom for the clients and bedrooms for the clients. LPA observed that the three client bedrooms located on the second floor that are all single occupancy rooms equipped with the single beds in each room, bedding including mattress covers, fitted sheet, top sheet and blanket, dresser in each room, night stand in each room, lamp in each room, chair in each room and closet areas in each room as required. LPA observed that the bathroom is equipped with a dual sink vanity and that the bathroom on the second level has a tub and shower area, no glass doors and a shower curtain. Licensee did turn the water on in the bathroom to verify running water and toilet was flushed to verify it is working. LPA did advise that the Licensee place a paper towel dispenser in the bathroom on the second floor as well. Bathroom was observed to have hand soap and hand sanitizer in the bathroom as well. LPA questioned the storage of towels in the facility and LPA did observe a storage area in the landing area where towels are to be kept to be accessible to clients when showering or bathing. LPA also observed an area on the second floor where Licensee intends to keep all required postings for client use like the Personal Rights and employee postings as well. LPA is advising that a copy of the personal rights poster also be posted in the main area of the facility as this is required for the Personal Rights and Ombudsman postings. On the second floor, LPA did observe an other closet where staff are to store extra hygiene items and bedding and LPA did advise that the closet be locked since it will house razors and extra hygiene items. Licensee did advise that any items in this closet not needing to be locked and stored inaccessible will be placed in the other storage area of the second floor that is not locked or secure. LPA toured the master bedroom on the second floor that is equipped with a bathroom for staff use. Licensee did advise that this room will be utilized for staff only and that no clients will be given access to this area. LPA did\n\nobserve that the staff room has a locking door, is currently housing computer and other office supply equipment. Licensee advised that all client files will also be housed in this room. Licensee states that the only file not to be kept in this area is related to medication and medication administration records and that binder will be in the medication area for the purposes of documenting medication when administered to clients. Licensee states that the ongoing notes for the clients will also not be housed in this area as this also needs to be in the area where staff are at with clients to document items as they happen. LPA advised that that would be fine. Licensee took LPA to the outdoor area of the facility to tour the outdoor area. LPA observed that there is a covered area outside but that there is currently no seating in this area. LPA informed Licensee that there needs to be an outdoor seating area for clients to sit outside when they would like to. Licensee showed LPA that the hot water heater access is through a door outside. LPA observed two utility sheds on the outside part of the facility and requested that both of these be opened but neither Licensee had the key to these sheds. LPA informed Licensees that the LPA would need a picture of the inside area of these sheds prior to the end of the day to verify its contents. Licensee did report that these sheds only housed a lawn mower and other yard equipment but LPA informed that we still have to verify this information prior to issuing license. LPA observed that the yard appears to be large enough to perform some activities should clients choose to use this area for outdoor activities. LPA did discuss with Licensees and administrator the fingerprinting requirement. LPA did advise Christine Quiruz that she is not fingerprint cleared for the Child Abuse Clearance Index and must be fingerprinted again in order to capture that requirement. LPA also informed Licensees that three of the four other staff that were to be hired and were ready to start work soon are not fingerprint cleared for Child Abuse Clearance either and they too would need to obtain additional fingerprint clearance to capture that requirement as well. LPA discussed with Licensees that the program design and application review documents will be sent to Licensees by Friday, 1/15/21 and that they would have 30 days to provide the required feedback to Licensing. LPA advised Licensees that the license would be effective on 1/13/21 with the license shall be printed 1/14/21. Once printed, the license would be sent via email to Licensees and Regional Center representative. Exit interview conducted with Licensees and document provided via email for signature and return.",

The following was observed: The facility living and meal prep spaces are clean and sanitary; the facility's first aid kit was observed to be complete; personal rights were posted; facility license was posted; smoke detectors are in working condition; water and room temperature measured within permitted ranges. The following deficiencies were observed on 3/7/22 and/or 3/11/22 (See attached LIC 809-D pages): 1) Two (2) unsecured jugs of laundry detergent were observed on the floor in the corner of resident R2's (See attached LIC 811) bedroom. LPA issued a citation of California Code of Regulations (CCR) Section 80087(g). Laundry detergent jugs were immediately removed from the room and placed with locked chemicals. 2) Laundry detergent was stored among food items all accessible to resident R2 as they were stored unsecured in R2's bedroom.

The laundry detergent jugs were removed, and R2 was moved out of this room by 3/18/22. 3) The storage loft in resident R2's bedroom has no full wall separating the spaces, so R2's bedroom is joint with staff \"room\" in the loft, meaning staff and resident shared a bedroom.

R2 was moved out of this room by 3/18/22, and the storage space is no longer being used as a staff bedroom. 8) Facility Manager stated disaster drills are conducted twice a year and that two drills were conducted in 2020, one in 2021, and none so far in 2022. Logs were located for only 3/31/20, 12/17/20, and 9/3/21. LPA issued a citation of Health and Safety Code (HSC) Section 1565(c), which requires quarterly drills. 9) Supervisor and Facility Manager confirmed that restraints have been performed at the facility in the past 6 months but there was no log of manual restraints. LPA issued a citation of CCR Section 84361(f). 10) Staff files for S1, S3, S4, S5 (see LIC 811-C) were observed to have incomplete or missing initial training logs.

LPA issued a citation of CCR Section 84070(b)(12). 15) The medication administration records (MARs) for residents R1, R4, R5 were observed to log...\n\n... psychotropic and non-psychotropic medications jointly rather than psychotropic medications being logged separately on the (or version of) LIC 622B Psychotropic MAR (PMAR). LPA issued a citation of CCR Section 84070(b)(13). 16) Facility Manager stated that the facility keeps old medication bottles, removes the labels, and uses them to transfer medications to that container for residents' home visits. LPA issued a citation of CCR Section 80075(k)(6). 17) The files for residents R1, R5 were missing property/valuables inventory, and the inventories were not updated for 2021/2022 for R2, R3, R4.

During visit on 3/11/22, LPA observed that staff left the laundry room open as well as the garage door while two residents were present and walking around the facility. Residents could have entered the garage and grabbed the documents, which LPA discussed with Facility Manager. Having the documents disorganized and outside of the proper secured file storage area does not encourage maintenance of confidentiality of documentation. LPA advises, per CCR Section 80070(c), that the facility ensure the garage door is kept closed and locked while residents are at the facility and that the facility remove and properly store the client documents currently in the garage. Garage was cleaned by 3/18/22. 5) LPA observed that residents R1 and R3 files were missing signed medical care consent forms.

LPA advised, per CCR Section 84087(e), that the facility begin documenting bedroom sharing and that residents are compatible and maintain this documentation in the file of each child sharing a bedroom.

The resident was assessed by a doctor on the same day of the seizure, and a follow-up evaluation by a neurologist was scheduled. Due to the fact that the resident did not have seizures in their care plan, there was no seizure plan in place, so when the signs of a seizure were recognized, 911 should have been called immediately. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be substantiated. LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80075 Health Related Services. See attached LIC 9099-D.

Based on confidential interviews and record review, the facility was unaware that a resident in care had a history of seizure activity. The resident last had a seizure at 9 years old, approximately 7 years ago. This is not documented in the resident's care plan and was only learned after a staff member witnessed the seizure and the facility notified a family member, who informed the facility of the previous seizure. The staff who witnessed the incident, which occurred around 5AM, responded to the sound of the resident falling off the bed and upon observing the resident shaking, turned the resident's head, and observed the resident until they stopped shaking after about 2 minutes, at which point the resident was able to get up and lie down on their bed. Due to believing it to not be critical, the staff member did not call 911. The staff shortly after called facility management, and when Facility Manager arrived... [CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE]",

LPA met with Administrator Ryan Busalacchi, Supervisor Edwin Isip, and Facility Manager Frances Nelson and informed of the purpose of the visit. The CARE Inspection Tool was used to conduct this inspection. During visit, LPA conducted two staff interviews and two resident observations. Residents returned from school around 4PM. At the end of visit, LPA encountered a system error that resulted in LPA's computer freezing and prevented the report from being completed and provided to licensee at visit. LPA completed report and provided to licensee on 2/22/23. During inspection, LPA observed the facility to have made significant improvements in compliance from the previous year's annual, including better file organization and implementation of staff training and resident activities. Food was within date, fresh, and stored correctly. One tub of expired sour cream that did not have visible mold was disposed of during visit. Hot water measured within permitted range, and the fridge was maintained at a temperature within permitted range. Planned menus and as served menus were maintained. Restraint log was maintained. Staff interviewed were knowledgeable of facility procedures and mandated reporting duties. Residents observed appeared dressed in clean, appropriate clothing and to be comfortable with staff present at the facility, evidenced by approaching and engaging with staff upon return from school. However, the following concerns require addressing. Two cigarette butts were observed with staff on the back patio near the rear sliding door. Construction items/supplies of a large nail on the ground and planks of wood with nails sticking out were observed in the side yard accessible to residents in care, with more planks in the other, gated-off side yard. The large nail was immediately removed by staff. Multiple areas of unknown brown substances were observed...\n\n...on the wall of the kitchen by the table, on the wall and back door of the rear bedroom, and on the ceiling of the middle hallway bedroom. The word \"crime\" was graffitied on the dresser in the middle hallway bedroom, and curse words were graffitied on the door of the rear bedroom and on two walls in the dining room, the latter of which staff statements indicate were not in the last two weeks. Residents R2 and R3 (See LIC 811 Confidential Names List) are prescribed levetiracetam and trazadone, respectively, and neither medication was logged on a separate log. Staff files contained missing or incomplete initial training logs for staff S1, S2, and S3 (See LIC 811), and all staff files reviewed were missing at least some certificates for trainings licensee confirmed staff attended. Activity supplies could not be located in the facility.

Documentary evidence from medical records and confidential interviews revealed inconsistencies as interviews found conflicting answers to questions asked by medical staff concerning specific accounts and dates of alleged sexual abuse. Confidential interviews by Investigator Santana also revealed inconsistencies. Statements obtained denied seeing any form of abuse or any opportunities for staff to engage in abuse. Confidential statement further revealed recantation of abuse to assigned social worker on 3/03/2025 but reaffirmed alleged abuse to others since leaving placement. Records reviewed found no indication of any trauma during C1's forensic examination. Confidential interviews with staffs and resident further denied the allegation, denied witnessing or other residents being subjected to sexual abuse. Information obtained found that C1 maintains that S1 threatened C1 with a gun to instill fear to sodomize C1. Interviews found that staff members denied there are firearms on the property, and witnesses also denied observing S1 handling a firearm at the facility. Information from interviews found that C1 maintains that S1 gave C1 marijuana on several occasions. Facility staff members reported that C1 sometimes asked for marijuana, but witness statements maintain denial of giving C1 any marijuana or that C1 smoked at the facility. Statements determined denial and no witness observations of S1 smoking at the facility. Based on gathered information, the allegations that S1 sexually abused C1; S1 threatened C1 with a gun and S1 provided marijuana to C1 is therefore determined unsubstantiated. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. There are no deficiencies cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, at this time. A copy of this report is provided to Administrator by email.",

    "narrative": "Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. Minors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment Continue on LIC9099-C\n\nBased on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to Facility manager.",

    "narrative": "Minors are not allowed hygiene items Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements regarding whether clients are not allowed hygiene items. Interview information revealed that clients are given hygiene boxes that contain toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, and other products which are available when the clients request them. Confidential interviews stated that clients are provided razors to shave but under the supervision of staff. It was noted in the facility\u2019s program statement that staff can withhold hygiene items from clients and provide them upon the request of the client depending on the client\u2019s level. Staff open minors\u2019 personal mail Confidential interviews indicated that the therapist keep all mail, unopened until the clients\u2019 next one-on-one therapy sessions. It was also disclosed that clients are required to open their letters in front of staff to make sure there is no contraband and confirmed that staff do not open clients\u2019 mails. Other confidential witnesses were unaware of the mail process and could not speak to this allegation. Some confidential witnesses stated that the clients open their personal mail in front of staff, and others stated the clients\u2019 primary therapists open their mail for them to screen letters and packages for contraband or triggering content. Minors not receiving an allowance Confidential interviews revealed that none of the minors received allowance during their residency at this Group Home. Per Facility Representative(s), the purpose of not providing clients allowance was to reduce the ability of incoming contraband. Facility Representative(s) also indicated that clients did not have a need for allowance as the Program provide the necessities for clients. Confidential interviews revealed that although allowance is not given, the facility provide for clients\u2019 needs which includes items while on outings. ------>\n\nMinors are denied access to personal property Confidential interviews revealed that clients are denied personal property based on scheduled activities and for their safety. Some personal items are stored locked in a cabinet and made available to clients upon request. Per Facility Representative(s) some items such as razors require direct supervision, while other personal items (such as books, clothing and etc.) are not allowed to be possessed by clients because the item could trigger client\u2019s behaviors or jeopardize their safety while in treatment Based on the confidential interviews, observation, and record review, it has been determined that although the allegations that minors are not treated with dignity; minors are not allowed hygiene items; staff open minors\u2019 personal mail, minors not receiving an allowance, and minors being denied access to personal belongings may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. The program statement has been updated to ensure that the clients\u2019 needs will be met based on their individual assessments per Title 22 Group Home Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was provided to the facility administrator.",
