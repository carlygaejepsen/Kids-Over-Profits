# Troubleshooting Summary: State Report Page Loading Issue

This document outlines the diagnostic and troubleshooting steps taken to address the 404 error preventing state report pages from loading correctly.

## 1. Initial Code and File Analysis

*   **File Read:** `ca-reports.html`
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the basic HTML structure of the report page.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the page correctly includes the `ca-reports.js` script via a `<script>` tag.

*   **File Read:** `js/ca-reports.js`
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the client-side logic for fetching and processing data.
    *   **Finding:** The script is designed to fetch data from URLs provided by the WordPress backend via a `myThemeData` object. The logic appeared sound, assuming the script itself loaded and the URLs were valid.

*   **File Read:** `functions.php`
    *   **Purpose:** To understand how WordPress enqueues scripts and passes data to them.
    *   **Finding:** The `load_new_multi_file_report_scripts` function correctly identifies the `ca-reports` page, generates URLs for the required JSON data files, and passes both the script and the data URLs to the front-end.

## 2. Problem Identification and Verification

*   **Initial Assumption (Incorrect):** The investigation initially focused on the belief that the `.json` data files were failing to load.
*   **Correction from User:** You clarified that the issue was more fundamental: the `ca-reports.js` script itself was failing to load, returning a 404 error in the browser's developer tools.

*   **URL Verification:**
    *   **Action:** Based on the `functions.php` code and user feedback that the theme directory is named `child`, the following URL was identified as the target for the JavaScript file: `https://kidsoverprofits.org/wp-content/themes/child/js/ca-reports.js`.
    *   **Tool Used:** `web_fetch`
    *   **Result:** Executing a fetch for this URL returned a **404 Not Found** error, confirming the file is inaccessible from the public web.

*   **File Existence and Permissions Verification:**
    *   **Action:** To confirm the file existed on the server at the expected location.
    *   **Tool Used:** `run_shell_command` with `ls -la js/`.
    *   **Result:** This command confirmed that `ca-reports.js` **does exist** in the `js/` directory and has standard file permissions (`-rw-r--r--`).

## 3. Troubleshooting Steps Attempted

The following potential solutions were attempted based on the diagnostic findings. All attempts failed to resolve the issue.

*   **Step 1: Wordfence Firewall "Learning Mode"**
    *   **Reasoning:** The presence of the Wordfence Web Application Firewall (WAF), identified via a directive in the `.htaccess` file, was the primary suspect for blocking the file request.
    *   **Action:** Instructed to place the firewall in "Learning Mode," visit the broken page to teach the firewall about the legitimate `.js` file request, and then return to "Enabled and Protecting" mode.
    *   **Outcome:** You reported this did not fix the issue.

*   **Step 2: LiteSpeed Cache Purge**
    *   **Reasoning:** A full review of the `.htaccess` file revealed the presence of the LiteSpeed Cache plugin. The theory was that an early 404 error could have been cached and was being served repeatedly, preventing any fixes from taking effect.
    *   **Action:** Instructed to use the "Purge All" function from the LiteSpeed Cache menu in the WordPress admin toolbar.
    *   **Outcome:** You reported this did not fix the issue.

*   **Step 3: `.htaccess` File Review**
    *   **Reasoning:** To check for any conflicting rules that might be blocking access.
    *   **Action:** The entire `.htaccess` file was read and analyzed.
    *   **Outcome:** The review confirmed the presence of both the Wordfence WAF and LiteSpeed Cache. It also noted a rule that *should* have explicitly allowed direct access to `.js` files, but was failing to do so, reinforcing the theory of a higher-priority block from the WAF or another server module.
