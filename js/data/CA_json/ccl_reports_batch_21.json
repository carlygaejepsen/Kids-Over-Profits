    "narrative": "Evidence for the allegation \"Facility staff failed to provide a safe environment for a resident\", as follows: On 6/14/2021 at 9: PM C1 was in a fight with another resident at the facility, Client 2 (C2) DOB: 1/28/2005. There was a video of the fight. Based on observations of the video by this LPA, C1 pushed resident, C2. C2 then punched C1 in his face several times, and the staff stood watching C1 get hurt. Staff reached their arm out then drew it back. The residents were chanting hit him harder! drop him on the floor! teach him a lesson! Then staff yelled, the cops were called. The other residents at the facility video typed the fight and posted it on social media: Snap Chat and Instagram. Shortly after the fight, C1 was taken to the emergency. C1 had sustained injuries, which include a broken nose, a cut behind his ear, and his arm was hurt. Based on interviews with staff members it was known that C1 and C2 are associated to an opposing gang, C2 is associated with blue (Sureno gang) and C1 is associated with red (Norteno gang). Interviews with PO and CSW confirmed that C1 is associated with red (Norteno gang). The Program Description states, \"Examples of when a youth may be screened out may include a youth who is a sexual perpetrator if there is a victim(s) already in placement that would potentially be put at risk or an entrenched gang member who is in an opposing gang of a youth already in placement...Having two Safety Net Shelter locations allows flexibility to make the most appropriate placement match\" (PD, Page 13). Based on interviews with staff members, moments before the fight, three (3) residents and the aggressor (C2) were making gang gestures in order to intimidate C1. The Program Description states, \"NO GANG ACTIVITY. Any gang related activity, including throwing gang signs, wearing gang related clothing, or having gang related conversation, is unacceptable. Tagging of any kind is NOT allowed in the program\" (PD, Page 25). A review of the staff schedule (Crisis Residential Staff Schedule: Week June 13, 2021- June 19, 2021) obtained from the agency administrator revealed that there were supposed to be three (3) staff members on shift. During the time of the incident there were only two (2) staff members for eleven (11) clients. Interviews with staff members confirmed that there is supposed to be three (3) staff members during the night shift and that there were only two (2) staff members during the time of the incident. Furthermore, the Program Description states, \"Clients identified as high risk for behavior issues receive additional monitoring from program staff, which increase the client to staff ratio\" (PD, Page 36). Investigation interviews, and a review of documents, which include the Program Description and Staff Schedules prove that the agency did not provide adequate supervision for the clients in care and did not follow the Program Description by screening out opposing gang members and increasing the client to staff ratio in order to provide additional monitoring. Therefore, the compliant is Substantiated. Based on LPA Raissi's observations, records reviewed, and interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the allegation, \"Facility staff failed to provide a safe environment for a resident\" is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Deficiencies (Type A) were cited. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was given to Cheryl Rouse, whose signature acknowledges receipt.",

    "narrative": "Continued... The report detailed that while C1 was placed at the facility, C1 disclosed an incident in which another minor entered C1's room and hit C1. The report included that on September 18, 2024, C1 absconded from the facility after notifying staff that C1 would be going to wash their clothing at a laundromat, despite the facility having a washer and dryer onsite. Additionally, the report detailed that C1 was not currently enrolled in or actively attending school. During the investigation, LPA Saeteurn interviewed clients (C1-C5), Staff (S1- S5), Witnesses (W1-W4) and reviewed pertinent facility records. In response to the allegation that staff did not prevent physical altercation between children, confidential interviews did not reveal any physical altercations between C1 and any other resident. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 was a client that enjoyed participating in multiple activities, was engaged in services, and was described as being friendly with staff and peers. Confidential interviews did, however, share that early into C1's arrival at the facility there were some situations in which C1 and C2 engaged in exchanging looks and made comments to one another during group activities, but interviews did not reveal that any physical altercations occurred. Confidential interviews revealed that there were situations in which some clients went into C1's room to take things. Confidential interview indicated that the clients were redirected and reminded by staff that they are not allowed in other clients' rooms; however, none of the incidents resulted in a physical altercation. A review of Special Incident Reports sent to CCL from the facility did not reveal any reports of a physical altercation occurring. In response to the allegation that staff did not supervise minor resulting in the minor being absent without leave from the facility, confidential interviews revealed that on the evening of September 18, 2024, C1 requested to wash their clothes. Confidential interviews revealed that during that time, staff were attempting to deescalate a client in care. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 entered the laundry room and staff were able to hear C1 starting their laundry while the door was open. A conflicting confidential interview revealed that the laundry room door leading to the inside of the home was closed which prompted staff to check in on C1. Confidential interviews revealed that S5 noticed that C1 was not in the laundry room and immediately began the facility's unauthorized leave protocol. Continued... Continued... A confidential interview revealed that the door to the laundry room must be left open for staff to observe clients. A review of a Special Incident Report submitted to CCL on 09/28/2024 revealed that while C1 was in the laundry area, \"C1 made the choice to AWOL through the side door of the facility\". A walk through performed by LPA Saeteurn on September 27, 2024, revealed that the facility has a washer and dryer on premises which is located in a room between the facility kitchen and garage/office area. The laundry room has three doorways, one leading to the garage/office area, one leading to the inside of the home kitchen area and a door leading to the outside of the home. LPA Saeteurn was able to see that the door leading to the side of the home gives access to an additional gate that leads to the driveway. Confidential interviews revealed that although clients are assigned a specific date to wash, C1 requested to use the washer on this day and staff approved it due to C1 having minimal clothing. A confidential interview confirmed that C1 was granted permission to use the laundry room on site and C1 proceeded to leave the facility to abscond. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 planned to abscond from the facility and communicated this to other residents. Confidential interviews revealed that clients were aware of C1's intentions to leave the facility, but it was not communicated to staff. Confidential interviews revealed that after S1 and S5 searched facility grounds for C1, an unauthorized protocol was enacted in which all parties were notified of C1 absconding. In reference to the allegation that staff did not ensure that minor attended school, confidential interviews and review of relevant client records confirmed that C1 was waiting for permanent placement to begin with Job Corps after being accepted into their program. The review of client records showed that C1 was attending school, however, conflicting confidential interview revealed that C1 was not enrolled in school. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 only attended the achievement center while placed at the facility which allowed for C1 to participate in education activities, sports, and field trips. A conflicting confidential interview revealed that the facility was allowed to complete the school enrollment process for C1 however, a conflicting confidential interview revealed that only the Authorized Representative and Educational Rights holder can make those decisions for minors in care. Confidential interviews revealed that C1's Education Rights Holder and Authorized Representative were contacted by the facility in an effort to help facilitate the process, however, neither C1's authorized representative nor educational rights holder ever completed the process. Continued... Continued... A review of the facility Program Statement revealed that if a client is not enrolled in school upon intake, the facility will work with the family to accomplish this goal and will include it on the service plan. Additionally, the program statement also included that the client would have free time at the facility to complete homework or can receive tutoring whether at a tutoring center or at the achievement center. Based on interviews conducted, LPA observation and record review, the allegations that staff did not prevent a physical altercation between children, staff did not supervise minor resulting in the minor AWOL'g from the facility and staff did not ensure that minor attended school are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violations occurred.

Confidential interviews revealed that C1 threatened to harm staff and C2, despite C2 not engaging with C1.

A confidential interview revealed that days prior to the incident, facility staff found a knife outside of the facility which they believed belonged to C1. Confidential interviews revealed that the behavior C1 displayed was not something common and that there was no known history of C1 engaging in these kinds of behaviors.

During inspection, LPA Mendoza met with staff Ricardo Alvarez and Jamere Crawford. On 10/15/ Community Care Licensing (CCL) received an unusual incident report regarding neglect/ lack of supervision resulting in minor (C1) being sexually assaulted by another minor (C2) on several occasions while in care. (Please refer to LIC 811 for confidential names, dated 03/01/22). Based on the severity of the incident, the incident report was referred to IB and accepted as a full investigation. IB report, Case No: CD2621-10152. During the course of the investigation, IB reviewed bed check documentation, (C1) and (C2) Initial Service Assessment/Documents, Client shift notes, interviewed staff members, and clients. Based on confidential interviews and the information obtained it was reported that both clients flirted regularly and would hug on occasion. The facility issued a \"flirt alert\" between both clients. A flirt alert was intended to inform staff that they should keep a closer eye on (C2) and (C1) when they are together. Also, staff should not allow them alone. Staff were aware of the inappropriate interaction between both clients, and were notified to provide additional supervision. However, staff did not increase their supervision to monitor both clients closely, which resulted in five separate incidents of sexual contact between (C1) and (C2) that was non-consensual. [Please refer to LIC 809-C] In addition, another client (C3) on 10/13/21 requested staff to check in with (C1) because of (C2) sexually assaulting (C1). Which resulted in (C3) leaving the facility because (C3) did not feel safe. Based on the information obtained, there is preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, the above incident is Substantiated. The facility will be cited under The Youth Homelessness Prevention Center (YHPC) Interim Licensing Standard (ILS) build on the current California Code of Regulations Title 22, Division 6, Chapter General Licensing Requirements and Chapter Group Homes.

    "narrative": "On 4/12/23, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a case management visit at the facility. LPA met with Administrator Ricardo Alvarez and Director of Health & Safety Katie Reisinger and informed of the purpose of the visit. On 10/26/22, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received an incident report (IR) that indicated that two residents, aged 13 and 17, had been caught together in a bedroom during the night bedroom checks on the night of 10/24/22. The younger resident alleged that the elder resident made sexual comments toward them and assaulted them. An investigation was conducted by CCL's Investigations Branch (IB), which found that it could not be determined that there was a lack of supervision leading to this incident occurring. Confidential interviews indicate that the residents were in the same bed together and were caught by staff and immediately separated. Review of the bed check logs indicated that at 10:20PM, the elder resident was asleep in bed, and from 10:40PM to 11:40PM, the younger resident was downstairs to get a glass of water and was talking to staff. Between 11:45PM and 12AM, a staff member was conducting bedroom checks and found the residents in the older resident's bedroom in the older resident's bed holding each other, with the younger resident making a statement that they were trying to help the older resident fall asleep. Later, though, the resident's narrative was inconsistent. The investigation also found that there was an occasion prior where female residents were found to have entered a male resident's room during the night and were directed by staff during night checks to go back to their rooms. The investigation found that the facility made reports to appropriate agencies, including CCL and law enforcement. Based on discussion with Administrator and Director of Health & Safety during this visit, the facility continues to conduct 20 minute room checks at minimum and will increase the frequency of checks when staff observe behaviors that cause concern. There are no deficiency citations. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left with Administrator Ricardo Alvarez and Director of Health & Safety Katie Reisinger, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the following issues and concerns with the Licensee for both Our House and My Place facilities: Administrator qualifications and duties, lack of administrative oversight, staff training, plan of correction, lack of trauma informed care, personal rights, and lack of supervision concerning the Our House facility. The three areas of concern applicable to the My Place facility are lack of administrative oversight, Administrator qualifications and duties and Plan of correction. Administrator qualifications and duties - LPM Smith advised there are concerns regarding the Administrator's lack of knowledge regarding specific incidents that have occur in the facility, lack of knowledge of the clients in care and the needs and services of the clients in care, and Administrator referring (Continued on page 2) Pg 2 (Continued from page 1) Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives to the Facility Manager, Joe Mendoza for information. The concerns cover the period of February 2022, when the Administrator of Our House was Darryl Evey until present. CEO stated that they are in the process of having facility administrators present at the facilities for 40 hours per week. They are also in the process of hiring a Director that will be overseeing the Administrators. Lack of oversight- LPM Smith advised there are concerns that the Administrator is not familiar with the regulations and there is a breakdown in communication amongst the staff. RM Cook stated there should be oversight by the Administrator and Board of Directors for all facility operations. CEO stated reports are emailed to CEO and he works on the outcome. Each month there is a board meeting and they go over special incident reports and Licensing reports. They also have a leadership meeting each week to go over pending issues. SBCCFS PRD Tracy Raymond shared improvements observed with Our House since the implementation of new youth and shelter protocols that San Bernardino county provides assist with, including CFTMs being initiated immediately, internal meetings every other week with FAP. The addition of Social Worker Julie Ann who comes from a trauma informed focus has been a strong positive influence over the last year. There are also supportive actions like peer advocates meeting with the youth to assist youth to adjust to being in a shelter. Tracy reported that Our House accepts placement for a broad spectrum of youth that are difficult to place and STRTP's are no longer willing to work with. If FAP calls the county emergency hotline, San Bernardino county representatives report to the facility and remove youth as necessary from placement to assist with de-escalation of emergency situations and crisis intervention. Tracy stated San Bernardino county is improving their practice and are helping FAP improve in their operations, working together as a partnership. Staff training- RM Cook advised there are concerns regarding a lack of staff training being reported from information gathered during complaint investigations and the annual inspections. CEO stated they began documenting the ongoing training a year ago when CCL brought this to their attention. Staff training is done every other Thursday, debriefing is done during staff meetings, along with scheduling staff, and outside agency training is provided. The process to onboard is four months and staff turnover averages at four months, leaving continued staffing issues as a primary struggle. As an incentive, the benefit of a half-paid day off has been implemented and additionally there are more outdoor activities which help the staff's mental health. (Continued to page 3) Pg 3 (Continued from page 2) Representative from the Catalyst Center, Misty Berard shared they are available for support and shared the following links: mberard@catalyst-center.org; kmartinez@catalyst-center.org; https://catalyst-center.teachable.com/courses; https://catalystcenter.learnupon.com/store Plan of correction (POC)- LPM Smith advised that Joe from Our House and Fatima of My Place submit plan of corrections in a timely manner. There are concerns with the plan of correction from Nike of My Place and Devin of Our House not being submitted on time and verbally stating the plan of correction will be late. LPA Valerie Wilson has reminded them that the request for an extension for the plan of correction needs to be submitted and approved by CCL prior to the due date. LPM Smith advised if plan of correction is not received by the due date and there has not been an extension approved by CCL for the plan of correction due date the facility can be assessed civil penalties. CEO stated that Fatima's Administrator qualifications were turned in to CCL for My Place. Fatima will ensure that the plan of corrections are done properly. The current Administrator for Our House, Devin, will be separating employment from Our House at the end of the month and a new Administrator will be hired at Our House. The Board has done some interviews to fill the Administrator position. CEO complained that previous administrator packets took longs periods of time to approve and possibly Joe Mendoza can be designated during CCL's review of the administrator packet. RM Cook stated that the turnaround time for administrator qualifications review should be less than two weeks if the statement of qualification, and the correct documents are all provided in a timely manner to the LPA, and the candidate meets regulation requirements. If additional information is needed from the facility the turnaround time may be longer. Lack of trauma informed care- RM Cook advised that there have been substantiated complaints and case managements involving violations of personal rights that imply a lack of trauma informed care being provided by the facility staff. CEO stated their staff receive a lot of harm reduction and trauma informed care trainings. SOC Alicia Bernstein provided an overview of trauma informed care and provide resources. Child Trafficking Research and Policy Unit Analyst Leland Turner discussed harm reduction and provided resources and links for support. leeland.turner@dss.ca.gov (Continued to page 4) Pg 4 (Continued from page 3) https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/ACIN/2019/I-28_19.pdf?ver=2019-07-23-145815-020, ACIN I-28-19 (July 22, 2019) Harm Reduction Series - Social Worker, ACIN I-50-19 (July 29, 2019) Harm Reduction Series - Probation Officer, ACIN I-36-21 (June 22, 2021) Harm Reduction Series - Law Enforcement, ACIN I- 31-22 (April 8, 2022), Harm Reduction Series - Caregiver and ACIN I-59-18 (September 14, 2018) Introduction to the Harm Reduction Strategies Series Regarding Commercially Sexually Exploited Children. Personal rights and Lack of supervision- LPM Smith discussed several substantiated complaints regarding personal rights and lack of supervision from 2022 to present. LPM Smith summarized deficiencies cited. LPM Smith informed the Licensee of the Technical Support Program (TSP), stating it is a branch that can work with FAP in various areas they may need support in regarding facility operations. A referral can be made but it is voluntary. CEO stated their intention was never to work with foster youth, but there was a need and CFS asked the facility for support. CEO stated foster youth are much more difficult than the runaways and respond differently to the support, and support with crisis intervention would be appreciated. LPM Smith advised FAP to identify any areas they may need support to CCL and CCL will submit a TSP referral. Tracy Raymond stated the harm reduction training and resources provided by the Child Trafficking Research and Policy Unit is super informative for harm reduction and collaboration. Tracy also stated that San Bernardino county understands the responsibility they have in this situation and will continue to partner with the facility to help with compliance issues. CEO stated that he was not in agreement with CCL findings. RM Cook advised that FAP has the right to appeal and there are times the appeal is heard and findings are overturned. SBCCFS Deputy Director Nancy Satterwhite stated the county has looked at ways to collaborate and how to \"team\" placement combinations for youth in care. Peer family advocates are connected with the youth and it has been beneficial. San Bernardino county will also be hosting a mandated reporter training at Our House and looking at the contracts with the County for extra supports services that can be implemented. The CEO reported feeling better about the interaction with DCFS and how they are removing the clients to help the Program succeed along with the new contract that includes a new crisis intervention protocol. RM Cook reminded that regulatory enforcement and compliance is provided to protect the health and safety of youth in care and CCL hopes that the Licensee will take advantage of the assistance, collaboration, and all resources offered and provided by CCL and each department represented in the meeting. (Continued to page 5) Pg 5 (Continued from page 4) The licensee is being requested to submit a Plan of Action for each of the focus areas above including the following: - How will the Board of Directors ensure appropriate administrative oversight is implemented? - Submit an updated LIC 500 for the hours that will be worked by the Administrator and facility staff -How will the Board review complaints, what information will be included in board meeting minutes, and how will the Board address issue client health and safety issues as they arise? - How will the facility ensure staff training is completed. - How will the facility ensure staff have knowledge of the program statement? - How will the facility ensure staff know how to implement appropriate crisis intervention? - How will the facility ensure the plan of corrections are completed and submitted to CCL by the due date? - How will the facility ensure trauma informed care is being provided? - How will the facility ensure the personal rights of clients are not being violated by staff? - How will the facility ensure that staff are adequately supervising the clients? The Plan of Action response will be submitted to CCL by August 29, 2023. If more time is needed to submit the plan of action or there are any questions, please contact LPA Valerie Wilson at valerie.wilson@dss.ca.gov or (951) 897-9155.
