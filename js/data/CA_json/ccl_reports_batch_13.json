In attendance were: Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives, Regional Manager (RM) Lacresha Cook, Licensing Program Managers (LPM) Stephanie Hudak and Ann Valenzuela, Licensing Program Analysts (LPA) Carol Anderson and Babatunde Aborchie; STRTP representatives, Vilma Davis, CEO/Founder, Tatiana Sankar, CFO/Co-Founder, Roisin Doy, Head of Service and Rushel Brooks, Administrator; and Riverside County Placement Representatives, Nisha Elliott, Behavioral Health, and Karin Atkis, Supervisor of Out-of Home Investigations. The following issues were discussed: Complaints Personnel Requirements Admission Policies Extension for the provisional STRTP license (12 mos. expires 7/21/21) During the meeting, LPM Hudak discussed the increase of complaints that occurred in the last three years. In 2021 there were ten complaints, 2020 there were 12 complaints and 2019 there were eight complaints. LPM Hudak discussed the patterns of the complaints relating to care and supervision. Per administrator, stated that increase of issues at the facility were in relation to clients in the home wanting to be out in the community but couldn't due to COVID pandemic. LPM Hudak discussed what kind of indoor activities are being provided to the clients. STRTP representatives stated that due to COVID-19, the indoor activities consist of Arts/Crafts, games, gardening, and various puzzles. STRTP representatives stated for outdoor activities they were doing beach walks and community walks. STRTP representatives stated prior to COVID-19 clients were taken to YMCA on a regularly basis for swimming. STRTP representatives stated activities are being offered but clients do refuse to participate in the activities or client's AWOL from the facility. LPM Hudak discussed the personnel requirements as it relates to staffing and crisis situations. STRTP representatives stated staff meetings are held every Monday. Staff goes over intervention techniques as incidents occur in the facility. LPM Hudak asked who the current Pro-Act trainer was and if current staff are trained, per the emergency intervention plan in their program statement. CFO stated she needs to attend the Pro-Act trainer re-certification course to do the training for staff. Ms. Doy stated she has been working with staff on different crisis intervention techniques and de-escalation communication with staff as she is present in the facility Monday through Friday 12-8:30pm. It was also discussed by CCL staff on what mental health services are being provided by the facility. STRTP representatives stated that most of the 1:1 therapy and drug and alcohol treatment is being provided by outside sources that include Vista Hill and McAllister. Ms. Doy stated she is a master's level social worker, not licensed, and not currently being supervised by a licensed therapist. It was also discussed by Riverside County representative, Ms. Elliott, that crisis intervention plan and training has to be completed by licensed mental health worker. Again, the facility stated they currently do not have a licensed mental health professional providing those services and currently looking for someone to fill that role. Both LPM Hudak and RM Cook emphasized to the STRTP representatives that they must follow their approved plan of operation and program statement, especially regarding the emergency interventions they are utilizing within the program as this is a basis to some of the current complaint issues. LPM Hudak also discussed admission policies and what the current plan is with accepting new placements. Ms. Brooks and Ms. Doy state, they are looking at compatibility when accepting new placements from the various counties. Current placements include clients from Riverside, Kern, and San Bernardino Counties. Riverside County representative, Ms. Atkins gave input on all the Child Protective Services Referrals that are receiving as well for their placements and they have seen an increase in lack of staff interventions. Lastly, the status of the STRTP provisional license was discussed. STRTP stated they started the process in 2018 for accreditation with Joint Commission, then stopped to work on STRTP application, and most recently started the process again. Currently, San Diego County Behavioral Health and Human Services is not contracting with them which has caused the facility to withdraw their Mental Health Application with the State of California. LPM Hudak provided information that per the current STRTP guidelines, in order for CCL to justify the extension of the provisional license past the 12-month expiration date, the facility needs to be in the process of obtaining Mental Health Approval and/or Accreditation. STRTP representatives were looking forward to applying for a contract again with San Diego County next year. Information that CCL received from San Diego County, was that new Mental Health contracts with San Diego County would not occur to 2023, which would be well pass the 18-24-month mark of the provisional license. LPM Hudak explained to facility representatives that they would need to make a decision on what their plan is for their facility since they did not have any confirmation of a mental health contract from a county to move forward with the provisional license extension. Suggestions of Transitional Housing facility or converting back to a Group Home for private pay or Regional Center was given. At this time, CCL is requesting a Corrective Action Plan due by 6/24/21, to include the following: 1) What the plan is for the operation of the facility if the STRTP license expires. 2) What the plan will be for crisis intervention training and implementation in the facility until a licensed mental health professional is hired. 3) What is the plan for in-house mental health services until a licensed mental health professional is hired. In closing, all parties were satisfied with all information that was discussed during the meeting. A copy of this report was given to and reviewed with Facility Administrator Rushel Brooks",

Administration advised that they had forgotten to give the money to the facility. During the course of the investigation confidential interviews were conducted, it was reported to the LPA that S9 did not want to take the clients out because S9 was scared the clients would steal. The staff had the funds and ability to take the clients out but S9 did not want to. It was further reported to the LPA the staff did what they could given the COVID- Pandemic. The clients were provided the following activities: Taco Tuesday at Rosa's Cantina, movies in the park outside on the facility grounds, an ice cream truck would come to the facility each week, pool days with a barbecue, trips to the salon to get their nails done, trips to the hair shop, Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. However, other information was received that the clients would watch Tik Tok (social media) and videos all day. The staff and clients would go in the community and the clients would steal from the store. There was always plans for activities but there was never any money available. There were no funds for staff to use or petty cash. Allegation #2) It was alleged on a holiday between April 2021-July 1, 2021, one or two clients went to S4's house for a few hours because staff called off and the facility was short staffed. Reportedly S4 was advised by Orange County Children and Family Services the clients could not hang out with S4's 18 year old foster child. During the course of the investigation confidential interviews were conducted, the LPA did not receive any corroborating information on whether the clients went to S4's house and/or spent time with S4's foster child. It was further reported to the LPA, the clients were always in the staff's care. If the clients did go to S4's home, there would have been a staff present. Allegation #3) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, client #2 (C2) was not required to attend therapy. During the course of the investigation confidential interviews were conducted, it was reported to the LPA C2 was supposed to go therapy before or after work but C2 refused to go. When C2 was not working on the weekends, C2 still refused to go to therapy. The staff would try to get C2 to go to therapy but they could not force C2 to participate. However, other information was received that C2 did not have to attend therapy and needed to focus on working. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations there were no planned activities in April and May of 2021, there was no outing/activity money available at the facility, clients spent unauthorized time with S4's foster child and clients who had jobs were not required to participate in therapy may have occurred, however, are not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "During the course of the investigation, the LPA conducted confidential interviews with seven staff. The LPA attempted to interview the three involved clients but they were not present when the LPA completed inspections to the facility, had been discharged from the facility or were on run away status. The LPA also completed a review of facility documentation. Allegation #1) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, hot food was left out from 1: PM-9: PM. The LPA received corroborating information from staff that dinner would be prepared and placed on the kitchen counter or on top of the dryer by 3:30 p.m. There was no set time for dinner. The clients would serve themselves and eat when they wanted to. The food would not be refrigerated and left out overnight. When the staff arrived the next morning, they would dispose of the food. It was reported to the LPA this occurred multiple times. Allegation #2) It was alleged that staff #1 (S1) and staff #2 (S2) told client #1 (C1) to shut up and called C1, \"Ghetto.\" S1 reported to the LPA, the incident occurred around 06/20/21. C1 was very aggressive, called S1 names and got in S1's face. S1 told C1 the way C1 was speaking to S1 was ghetto and C1 needed to stop calling S1 the, \"Work Nigger,\" and \"Work Nigga.\" C1 also called S1 a, \"Fucking bitch,\" and \"Bruh.\" S2 denied making the alleged statements and further denied being present during the incident. During confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA S1 was constantly inappropriate with the clients. A client would yell at S1 and S1 would yell back, tell them to shut up and get in the client's face. It was further reported S1 admitted to the incident. S1 was frustrated about not receiving support from the administrator at the time. S1 apologized to the client. The LPA did not receive any evidence that S2 made the alleged comments. Allegation #3) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, Anasheh Safarian (S3) was listed as the administrator of record. During this time, the facility had two administrators. S3 was the administrator during the day and Charmaine Linley (S9) was the administrator at night. S3 was present at the facility only four times from April 2021-July 1, 2021. S3 worked out the licensee's corporate office in Sun Valley, CA. During confidential interviews, the LPA received corroborating information that S3 was not on the facility premises each week. It was reported S3 was the administrator on paper only. S3's work was performed at the licensee's corporate office. The facility submitted a letter and supportive documents to CCL, dated 04/08/21, indicating S3 was the administrator effective 04/08/21. The facility did not report to CCL that S9 was hired or that S9 would be an administrator in addition to S3. *** *** Allegation #4) It was alleged that staff did not receive required training. There were multiple staff who supervised the clients in the facility swimming pool in May and June of 2021, but did not have water safety certificates. The facility was licensed on 09/15/20 but the licensee did not offer the water safety training prior to April of 2021. The LPA requested proof of completed water safety training from the facility for the staff who supervised the clients in the facility swimming pool in May and June of 2021. The facility submitted copies of the certificate of completion for the American Red Cross Water Safety for Parents and Caregivers for some of the staff but no proof was provided for S1 and staff #6 (S6). In addition, the certificate of completion for S2 was dated 07/15/21, after S2 had provided the supervision. Allegation #5) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, the facility bathrooms and bedrooms were only cleaned on Monday (by a professional cleaning crew) and that on other days bathroom trash would be left overflowing and there were dirty counters and floors. On 6/10/2021, a client dyed their hair black and walked through the facility, staining floors in the hallway and bathroom. During confidential interviews, the LPA received corroborating information when the morning staff reported to work, the facility was dirty on a weekly basis. The trash was not taken out, the kitchen, living room and the clients' rooms were dirty. The LPA completed a safety inspection of the facility on 07/14/21 at 11: AM. Although the facility was clean, the LPA observed black dye on the door jam in the client bathroom. Based on confidential interviews, document review and the LPA's observation, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the allegations food was not stored in a safe manner, S1 spoke inappropriately to C1, facility administrator was not on the premises 20 hours a week, facility staff were not properly trained and the facility was not kept clean are substantiated. Facility is cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1 80076(a)(14) Food Services, 80065(e)(2) Personnel Requirements, 80087(a) Buildings and Grounds and the Interim Licensing Standards Article 6 87072(c)(10) Personal Rights and 87064(b)(1) Administrator Qualifications and Duties on the next pages. A copy of this report, the LIC Confidential Names, and appeal rights were provided to Mariam Mott. Allegation #1) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, the facility did not have enough milk or two days worth of perishable items. The staff would also feed the clients fast food. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA there was always a supply of fresh food. The food was purchased from Shamrock Foods Company (commercial food supplier) and delivered every Thursday. If the clients did not like what was on the menu, they were allowed to request other food items. The staff would then go purchase the requested food items. Four gallons of milk a were ordered each week. If the milk supply ran low, they would order through Instacart (grocery delivery service). The LPA completed a safety inspection of the facility on 07/14/21 at 11: AM and observed the food supply. There was an adequate supply of food and perishables. The LPA also obtained copies of invoices from Shamrock Foods Company from 05/01/21-7/8/21. The facility consistently ordered food each week, including milk and perishables. However, other information was received that the pantry was empty seven or eight times. One time was due to the house being bombed for bugs. Allegation #2) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, that dated menu documentation was not available. The menus were posted a couple of times and they were outdated. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA the weekly menus were posted on the refrigerator. The menu copies were kept for months in the staff office. In addition, there were electronic copies of the menus. The LPA completed a safety inspection of the facility on 07/14/21 at 11: AM and observed four weeks of dated menus posted on the side of the refrigerator and the menu for the day on a decorative chalkboard on the kitchen counter. However, other information was received that the menus were not posted prior to 07/13/21. Allegation #3) It was alleged from April 2021-July 1, 2021, adults from the licensee's substance use disorder (SUD) site across the street from the facility were allowed to come into the facility with the clients and were left alone with clients and act as mentors to the clients. It was a regular practice to have staff working in the facility that did not have a criminal record clearance. It was alleged staff #10 (S10) did not have a criminal record clearance on 6/10/2021. S10 was allowed to supervise the clients prior to being fingerprint cleared. During the course of confidential interviews, it was reported to the LPA the clients were never left unsupervised with the adults from the SUD site. Vera's Sanctuary (VS) staff were always present. *** *** The adult clients and VS clients had group sessions together on the VS porch for approximately two months and the adult clients would come to the VS swimming pool to hang out. The group sessions and the adult clients visits to the swimming pool were stopped by the facility after LPA Torres completed the 10 day inspection for this complaint on 07/14/21. The LPA verified through the CCL database that S10 had a criminal record clearance and was associated to the facility on 05/10/21. However, other information was received stated the clients would go across the street to the SUD facility to play pool (billiards) in the garage. The adult clients were also present in the garage and no VS staff were supervising the clients. This happened five times. It was a regular practice to have staff working in the facility that had not received a criminal record clearance. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations the facility did not have enough milk or two days worth of perishable items, menus were posted a couple of times and they were outdated, adults from the SUD site were allowed to come into the facility with the clients and were left alone with clients and it was a regular practice to have staff working in the facility that did not have a criminal record clearance may have occurred, however, are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, the LIC Confidential Names and appeal rights were provided to Mariam Mott.",

    "narrative": "(C1) was observed with a hicky and notes C1 participated in sexualized behavior. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute this was a consensual interaction, or that this was the incident resulting in the allegation of sexual abuse. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute the allegation. An additional allegation was received by CCL, alleging staff purchased drugs for minors while in care. No specific information regarding which staff or which minors were involved in this allegation was provided. Record review and confidential interviews were unable to provide evidence confirming or disputing this allegation. Two additional allegations were received by CCL alleging minors are not allowed to leave the home and staff demonstrate inappropriate forms of punishment. Specifically it was reported staff did not let any of the minors leave the home and staff refused to allow (child #1 [C1]) to leave the facility to purchase hygiene supplies as a form of punishment for not attending class. Record review and confidential interviews reported that none of the residents had community passes approved by their County Social Workers at the time of the allegation. Confidential interviews reported the facility provided hygiene products for the residents and if the residents wanted to purchase special items staff would take them and accompany them to the store. Confidential interviews could not confirm, or dispute minors were not allowed to leave the home and staff refused to allow C1 to leave the facility as a form of punishment. An additional allegation alleging staff do not ensure the minors are properly fed while in care was also received by CCL. Specifically it was reported that food is not satisfactory, and the good food was locked up. Confidential interviews reported that the minors wanted more of the unhealthy fast food type of meals and would complain about what the chef had made for dinner. Confidential interviews could not confirm or dispute the allegation. Based on record review and confidential interviews the minors are sexually abused while in care, staff purchased drugs for minors while in care, minors are not allowed to leave the home, staff demonstrate inappropriate forms of punishment, and staff do not ensure the minors are properly fed while in care, may or may not have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by the evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report was provided along with appeal rights to Andrea \"Dre\" Carmona.",

Confidential interviews also denied that staff did not fulfill reporting requirements or that S1 had engaged in an inappropriate relationship with C1. According to confidential interviews, S1's relationship with C1 was more of an older sibling or mother-daughter relationship. Confidential interviews also stated that although C1 had gained access to a knife and alcohol on separate occasions, it was not due to a lack of supervision, but due to C1 smuggling in contraband without staff's knowledge and C1 having taken or stolen key from staff where knives were stored. While other confidential information received by Licensing Office stated that these allegations had occurred. LPA Mena was unable to conduct a follow-up interview with Child # 1 (C1), due to C1's current whereabouts being unknown. There were no other known witnesses to these allegations. Based on confidential information obtained during the course of this investigation, the allegations that Child # 1 had access to alcohol and sharp object, and that facility staff did not fulfil reporting requirements, did not prevent inappropriate sexual behavior between clients while in care, and that Staff # 1 (S1) had engaged in an inappropriate relationship with C1, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence.

Due to an absence without leave (AWOL) status C1 could not be reached for comment regarding the allegations. During investigation, a confidential interview could not provide details about the allegations involving C1, and S1 due to being hired after C1 left the facility and due to little interaction with S1. Confidential interview further stated that some clients did smoke while in care and smoked outside of the facility premises, which was against the program's rules. Confidential interview denied hearing anything about S1 or C1 that pertained to the allegations. Additionally, S1, S3 and C1 could not be reached for comment. There were no other known witnesses to the allegations. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegations. Based on confidential interview and record review the allegation that a staff member took C1 to a smoking establishment, C1 smoked in the presence of staff members, staff members gave C1 a smoking device, and S1 inappropriately touched C1, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

LPA Segura and McCambridge met with Danielle Stewart who facilitated the tour of the facility, inside and out. The group home is licensed to serve eight clients, children and non-minor dependents. Currently in placement are eight clients. There were no clients present during the initial inspection of the facility. There were only two clients who are subject to this inspection. The facility's buildings and grounds appeared to be in compliance, and no deficiencies were observed during the inspection of the grounds. The inspection of the grounds took place at approximately 9:15am. At 9:30am LPAs Segura and McCambridge conducted a review of two client files. In the course of conducting the file reviews LPAs also interviewed direct care staff Bruno Llerena due to availability later in the day. At approximately 11am LPAs conducted a medication count inspection with medical coordinator Debbie Thompson. In the course of conducting the medication count inspection LPAs found that the facility PMARs have a documentation conflict. The facility's practice is to have a weekly PMAR; however, the week begins at the after school dispensing window in the middle of the day. Continued on 809C The facility uses a PMAR printed and dated by the pharmacy. For C2 (C2, Client 2 see confidential names list LIC811 dated 08/17/2021) LPA found that the PMAR was dated for the week of 08/12-08/18 with columns labeled for the days of the week starting with Thursday through Wednesday. Medical coordinator indicated that since the medication weekly packs start effectively during the after school dosage, they end up documenting the last AM medication administered on Thursday the 19th on the space that corresponds for Thursday the 12th. The facility was advised to consider revising PMAR, see advisory note. At around 11:45pm LPA Segura conducted an interview with medical coordinator Debbie Thompson. Shortly after at approximately 12:30 an interview was also conducted with administrator Kristine Martinez. Staff file reviews were conducted by LPAs at around 12:30pm. No deficienceies were found during this inspection. There were no deficiencies noted at today's evaluation. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was left with the administrator Kristine Martinez.",

This includes encouraging C1 to stay and reminding C1 of the dangers of AWOLing. Additionally, Staff would follow C1 until they lose site of C1 than make the calls to the authorized representative, Law Enforcement, the Child Abuse Hotline and submit a Special Incident Report. Furthermore, the reported incident occurred while C1 was on AWOL and per interviews, staff followed their emergency intervention plan to try to prevent C1 from AWOLing. LPA could not determine if Staff did not prevent minor from participating in inappropriate behavior due to the incident occurring when C1 was on AWOL status and Interview statements indicating that staff followed AWOL procedures. In addition, per CFT notes and C1's Safety Plan, facility had a safety plan for C1 in efforts to decrease C1's unsafe behavior.

    "narrative": "S1 and S2's ProAct Certifications; and S1's Resignation Letter. It was reported that on 05/05/2020, C1 was escorted and put into a safety hold due to C1 allegedly assaulting staff. Interviews revealed that C1 had a glue in his hand and S1 suspected C1 was going to use the glue for substance abuse which was what lead to the initial escort conducted on C1. It was informed to LPA Yem that S1 was verbally prompting C1 to give the glue but C1 refused. Documentation and interviews revealed that C1 was put in an escort safe hold position in the hallway and it continued to inside of the restroom. S1 denied the allegation. Video footage dated 05/05/2020, LPA Yem observed the following: At 00:17, S1 can be seen following C1. At 01: S1 and S2 can be seen conducting the escort position on C1 while C2 is watching the incident and C3 can be seen passing by. LPA did not observe physical aggression or assault from C1 towards staff during this time frame. LPA observed C1 in the escort position but LPA was only able to see S1 outside of the doorway of the restroom and a part of C1's head; however, at 02:03, LPA Yem observed there was a struggle that lead to S1, S2 and C1 inside the bathroom where it was not visible to the camera's angle. At 02:09, C2 and C3 was watching what was taking place inside the restroom. At 05:08, S1 can be seen walking out of the bathroom and another staff comes into the bathroom which is S5. S3 came at the end and did not observe the incident. At 10:30, C1 was observed walking out of the restroom. It was reported that C1 refused nursing assessment. It was also reported that C1 called the police. Facility's Internal investigation revealed that C1 indicated he was thinking about using the glue to huff because he was upset that he did not have access to any other substances. CFT Notes and Needs and Services Plan confirmed that C1 does have a history of severe substance use behavior; however, C1 denied wanting to use the glue as a substance. S4 indicated that she observed C1 sniffing the glue and that was when she asked for S1 and S2 to help assist. Interviews revealed that C1 was pouring glue on the floor. C1, C2, C3 and S1 confirmed that C1 was not observed being assaultive with S1 initially. Interviews revealed that C1 did try to get out of the escort hold and there was a struggle in the restroom. LPA could not determine if in fact C1 was extremely aggressive and swinging at staff due to inconsistent statements and no visibility on what occurred inside of the restroom. It was reported that C1 was kicking and scratching staff, C1, C2 and C3 denied this allegation. Report Cont. on LIC 9099-C. Emergency Intervention debriefing for C1 asked C1 the question of how were you in danger to yourself and/or others? It was written on the document that C1 indicated he started swinging at staff, yelling and getting aggressive. C1 denies putting hands on staff. Confidential interviews could not confirm if S1 pushed C1 but confirmed that a restraint was conducted. LPA Yem could not confirm if C1 met the requirements of the initial escort due to inconsistent statements of C1 getting physically assaultive with staff or C1 possibly using the glue as a substance being the reason why C1 was put in an escort position. Per supportive evidence, it was revealed that on 05/27/2020, C1 was interviewed and marks or bruises were not observed on C1. Documentation confirmed that redness was observed on C1 but no injuries to report. Furthermore, on 05/27/2020, S1 resigned from the facility. Although S1 recollection of events could not be obtained by LPA, facility's UIR, Post restraint debriefing, and internal investigation revealed that S1 escorted C1 due to C1's assaultive behavior which LPA did not observe assaultive behavior from C1 that took place outside of the restroom; in addition, LPA could not confirm what occurred inside of the restroom. Witness statements revealed that C1 did not appear to be in pain; however, it was reported that C1 had pain to his right ribcage and visible contusion to his left biceps and right shoulder blade. On 06/02/2020 an email from RP indicated that it was informed to the RP staff grabbed C1 by the arm causing bruising on his arm. LPA Yem could not confirm if C1 was observed with marks or bruises on his ribcage by the RP due to RP being unable to recall if there was any redness or bruising to C1's rib cage and what was said by staff. RP did recall seeing some redness on one of C1's arms but can't recall exactly which arm. Additionally, RP indicated that the subject's injuries and statements made by staff should be documented in RP's initial report. Lastly, the Department received a copy of the Police Report which provided additional information for the complaint investigation. The Police Report indicated that C1 did indeed obtain injuries from the restraint to his left arm and right shoulder blade as there were bruises noticed by the Police Officers. Based on the confidential interviews conducted and documentary evidence obtained during the investigation the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. Per the Interim Licensing Standards for STRTP V 3. Section 87095.00 (c) (2) for the following deficiency was cited at the time of this visit.

During an unannounced inspection to the facility on 5/12/ LPA Larios observed C1, two clients and three staff, meeting the required ratio.

Information obtained from (S1, S2, and S3) denied the alleged allegations indicating that they have worked at the facility for several years and have never observed or heard of any staff member allowing any client in care to smoke anything at the facility. Staff further disclosed that in the past they have had clients that would AWOL after school or from the facility and would return to the facility smelling like marijuana. Staff indicated that upon returning to the facility from AWOL, clients are instructed to conduct a self-search to prevent any contraband from entering the facility. Staff denied knowing or observing any client being over-medicated or using the medication as a chemical restraint. Staff indicated that type of behavior will not be tolerated and will be handled accordingly. Staff further indicated that all medications are in the form of pill packs that are properly labeled and stored individually with each client's medication logbook to prevent any confusion. As to the allegation of staff speaking inappropriately to minors in care, staff denied the allegation indicating that all staff members are trauma-informed and have a great relationship with the clients. Staff further disclosed that from time to time they (staff) have had to raise their voices with clients to redirect them or prevent physical altercations between clients. Information obtained from Clients (C1, C3, and C5) denied the alleged allegations further indicating that they have never seen or heard of any clients smoking anything at the facility, however, have observed clients returning to the facility after AWOLING smelling of marijuana. Clients denied knowing or hearing of anyone being over-medicated by staff. C1 indicated that their medication is given at certain times and gets logged by staff in the medication logbook. As to the allegation of staff speaking inappropriately to youth in care, clients denied the allegation further stating that the staff is very supportive and provide them with whatever is needed. Information obtained from County Social Workers (CSW's) (CSW1, CCSW2, and CSW4) indicated that they don't have any concerns about the care and supervision that the facility staff is providing their clients.

Information obtained from S1, and S2 indicated that the cameras were installed prior to them working with the facility and provide security to the clients and staff. S1 and S2 were unable to provide any incidents where the client's privacy has been violated nor have the clients reported any such violations to them. S1 further disclosed that all cameras are visible and are only placed in the facility's common areas and on the exterior of the facility. Information obtained from S3 indicated that the cameras were added to the facility due to a previous incident that had occurred involving a client attacking their Social Worker and cash missing from the staff office. Furthermore, an addendum to the facility Program Statement was made and approved by Community Care Licensing (CCL). S3 indicated that all video that is recorded is kept for forty-five days and discarded unless required during an investigation. As to the camera in the staff office if needed due to privacy concerns staff can disconnect the camera, however, the facility also provides a room where the Social Workers and clients can have a private conversation. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred, therefore the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated.

LPA attempted to interview additional minors and placement agency social workers between 5/19/23 to 8/7/23 but the attempts were unsuccessful. Confidential interviews reveal that minors \"played wrestle\" with each other during placement. One minor, who refused to provide a statement, engaged in \"body shots\" with other minors.

It was alleged that staff were not communicating with a minor's representative in a timely manner. And it was alleged that staff spoke to minor in an inappropriate manner. LPA's investigation revealed that the STRTP provides school supplies to clients as new school year starts. The STRTP screens incoming packages to prevent contraband, so although there may be a slight delay, the packages are ultimately delivered to clients. The facility notified clients' social workers of phone outage via email immediately. The facility requires clients to wash their hands before going in to refrigerator for food. interviews with staff reported that school supplies provided were not to client's liking, so he refused them. Staff stated that when youth asked for his package, staff was unaware it had arrived as it had already been moved to admin's office for safekeeping. Staff stated that though phone line was out, internet was still working, so client could have made calls over wifi from his cell phone. Staff stated client was asked to wash hands before going in to the fridge, refused, and tried to push his way past staff, who simply held their ground; reporting party stated that after speaking with minor, she understood this to be correct version of events. The facility social worker stated that she has been the one to engage authorized representative in communicating. Staff denied speaking to minor inappropriately, stating that he was who tended to call others out of their name. Professional contacts had no concerns over the allegations. Confidential interviews provided conflicting information, neither corroborating nor refuting allegations.

During the Annual Inspection June 21, 2022, Ref. #3 informed LPA Pamela Silva, \"Staff treats client good and they interact well with him.\" LPA McGee toured the facility on July 14, 2022 and observed it to be safe, clean and in good repair. An interview with the Sr. Facility Manager, revealed that she washed the linen and cleaned the other clients' bed. The Sr. Facility Manager stated that information regarding a vap pen being found was disclosed, but the facility was unable to confirm it. The Ref. #3 denied having inappropriate sized clothing. The LPA observed clothing listed on Ref. #3's Personal Property and Valuables for the months of April and May 2022, and observed $100 clothing allowance that was distributed for each month, April, May and July 2022. The investigation did not reveal that Ref. #3 had a medical problem. The LPA observed Ref. #3's health screening. An interview with the County Social Worker revealed no concerns about the facility and that Ref. #3 has a history of not telling the truth in order to be placed closer to the biological family. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegations. So, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

Interviews revealed that it came to the attention of staff when they heard C1 screaming. In addition, C1 confirmed the allegation. The Special Incident Report in relation to this incident did not accurately the depict the incident that occurred. The incident occurred during a shift change and there were no designated Nocturnal Shift Staff located on the floor at 10:00pm to provide care and supervision for the clients in care. The 15-minute log dated on 02/02/2020 was not accurate as it documented a staff that did not work that day which is S5. Although it was indicated that C3 might have gotten the lighter during AWOL and C1 was not injured, there was no confirmation that Staff was present during the time of the incident which poses a potential Health, Safety or Personal Rights risk to clients in care due to the contrabands that were involved. Based on the interview statements and documentation obtained, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. Facility cited for Violation of California Code of Regulations, Title Division Six, regulation 80078 (a): Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision: The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. Documentation and interviews confirmed that Staff was not present during the time of the incident between C1, C2, and C3. C3 retrieved a lighter and deodorant aerosol can and ignited spray from the can. C2 held C1 down while C3 sprayed on C1's direction. Staff did not witness this incident and was aware of it when C1 ran downstairs and screamed. See 9099-D A copy of this report and appeal rights will be emailed to the facility.",

On 5/18/2020 at 2:10:06 a Special Incident Report addendum was submitted which indicated C1 assaulted the staff by punching the staff in the shoulder area. The staff is seeking to press charges and file a restraining order against C1. CSW was called on 5/17/2020 in order to ask for immediate removal of C1 from STRTP Wayfinder Family Services due to youth C1's unsafe behaviors. Since staff were unable to get a hold of the CSW and Supervisor, Child Abuse Hotline was called. The ER CSW informed facility that they would be coming out to assess. A letter for intent to discharge C1 was sent on 05/14/2020 and to be effective immediately due to C1's lack of engagement and participation in services. LPA could not interview RP to obtain additional information after multiple attempts. LPA could not interview S1 after multiple attempts.

    "narrative": "On April 7, 2021, Licensing Program Analyst (LPAs) Regina Martin and Charmetha White conducted a follow-up Case Management - Incident inspection (via telephone) to discuss and deliver findings from the Department's investigation concerning Incident Report (SIR) #737093; dated: January 2, 2021 involving clients' physical fatal assault on staff member and subsequent arrest. LPAs spoke with Facility Representative, Kristal Audoma Facility Director/Administrator. On January 4, 2021, Wayfinder Family Services reported that on January 2, 2021 seven male clients, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7, assaulted staff members, resulting in Staff #1's (S1) death [see Confidential Names form, LIC811]. Interviews conducted with staffs involved and facility administration revealed consistent statements that S1 was attempting to intervene to prevent C2 from physically engaging with C1 on behalf of staff (S5) who was verbally redirecting C1 in attempts to de-escalate C1's assaultive behavior. During the scuffle S1 was head butted by C1 and thereafter six other youth began hitting kicking and pulling the staff's hair. Four staffs (S3, S4, S5 and S7) intervened and pulled the clients off S1 while also being attacked by the youths. Staff members were able to assist S1 in walking away at which time two of the youth assaulted S1 again, causing S1 to fall to the ground. Once on the ground, the other youths hit, kicked and pulled the staff member's hair again. Staffs were eventually able to assist S1 to exit the campus to await the paramedics. Law enforcement was contacted by the facility prior to the assault. When law enforcement arrived at the facility the youth ceased their assaultive behavior. Staff #1 was transported to the Hospital and passed away on January 3, 2021. Law enforcement arrested C1 and C2 on January 2, 2021. Five addition youths were also detained and await trial. Law enforcement's investigation report is currently pending. (Continued on page 809-C) Statements obtained during the investigation corroborate claims that two of the clients involved (C1 and C2) were the main individuals enforcing the assaultive behavior towards staffs while other youths seemed to join in as a means of teaming together against staff. While it is not known what exactly incited C1's disruptive behavior, witnesses indicate C1 appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance at the time of the incident as it was noted, C1 did not appear to be himself. Interviews and review of facility's incident report details revealed the facility made appropriate attempts contacting the Psychiatric Mobile Response Team (PRMT) and Law Enforcement at the onset of C1's escalating behavior. A review of facility records further revealed at the time of the incident the census was 16. Fifteen residents were present at the facility at the time of the incident; seven youths were actively involved in the incident. The remaining clients were not present at the scene nor witnessed the incident. There were a total of 10 staffs actively working on shift during the incident; five of whom were physically involved. Records indicate the facility was operating within approved staffing ratios. Based on the gathered information obtained from interviews capturing accounts of the incident from those involved, review of corresponding incident report, staff ratios, staff training and client records, revealed the facility was operating within STRTP required guidelines and further reveals the facility responded appropriately to address the situation. The results from the investigation found no deficiencies cited related to the incident. Exit Interview conducted. A copy of this report is provided to Administrator.",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that a staff member at the facility made inappropriate comments towards a client in care, telling them to act upon their suicidal ideations. In an interview conducted, one child stated that sometime between August 2021 and November 2021, a staff member stated that they should act upon their suicidal ideations in response to the child voicing their mental health struggles. The child stated that they understood the staff member may not have been seriously trying to get them to act upon their suicidal ideations, but that the comments were unprofessional and hurtful. In interviews conducted with two other children, both stated that they had not seen or heard of any staff members making those types of comments. One of the children elaborated and stated that the alleged victim did not get along with staff members, but that staff would never make comments like the ones alleged. In an interview conducted, the staff member that the allegations are centered upon denied making the comments. Two other staff members that were interviewed also stated that they had not seen or heard of any staff members making inappropriate comments like that towards clients in care. Staff members caught doing so would be immediately terminated from employment. Additionally, all staff members reportedly undergo personal rights training regularly. In an interview conducted, the child's mental health therapist stated that the alleged incident had not been reported to him by the client and that they had not seen or heard of any staff members making any types of comments like that towards clients in care. A review of records indicated that around the time that this incident allegedly occurred, there were at least two instances in which there were concerns regarding the client's mental health and possible self-injurious behaviors. In both instances, staff reportedly followed all proper procedures and obtained the assistance necessary to help the client through the situations. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the above allegation occurred. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegations are deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Follow up interviews were conducted as needed, between 12/7/22 and 3/2/23. It was alleged that facility staff did not prevent client from being sexually abused while in care. Confidential interviews reveal that two incompatible clients were placed in the same bedroom as roommates. Issues related to difference in ages, behaviors and background information were discussed with the Administrator by multiple staff prior to placement of client (C1) at the facility (see Confidential Names Form dated 5/8/23). There was also a dangerous sexual propensity noted on the other client's (C2) Needs and Services Plan. Administrator still placed client (C1) with client (C2) in the same bedroom despite recommendation not to, citing that room changes would be too disruptive to other clients. There was no safety plan implemented. A few weeks after placement, client (C1) reported being sexually assaulted by client (C2). Details of the incident were disclosed by client (C1) to two staff and then later, to law enforcement. The incident was not reported by client (C1) right away due to threats made by the other client (C2). Administrator made room changes after the incident however, client (C1) was removed from placement. Other clients in placement were also removed after a report that client (C2) had inappropriately touched other clients in placement. Client (C2) denied the allegation. The Administrator denied being advised by any staff about the incompatibility of clients (C1 and C2). Other related parties gave consistent information when interviewed. Based on information obtained by Investigator Rippe from confidential interviews and records reviewed, there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation therefore, the allegation is substantiated. A deficiency citation is issued under California Code of Regulations (CCR) 80078(a) Responsibility of Providing Care and Supervision. This violation poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. A Plan of Correction was discussed with the facility representative. Copies of the following reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection: LIC 9099, LIC 9099-C, LIC 9099-D and LIC 811. Appeal Rights Forms were provided and explained.

LPA Yamamoto discussed the following with the facility representative named above. On 5/8/23, the Department concluded a complaint investigation on a Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) which alleged that facility staff did not prevent client from being sexually abused while in care. Two clients were placed together in one bedroom even though there was no commonality in their ages, behaviors and background information to make them suitable roommates. The older client has a known dangerous sexual propensity towards younger children. Multiple staff expressed this concern to the Administrator, but clients were still placed together despite staff concerns. Based on the consistent statements obtained and records reviewed during the investigation, there was a preponderance of evidence that supported the allegation. The allegation was substantiated, and the facility was cited for Neglect/Lack of Supervision under California Code of Regulations (CCR) 80078(a). The Department has concluded an analysis and determined that an Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted. Under Health and Safety Code section 1548(f)(1)(C)(ii), a violation that the Department determines results in physical abuse as defined in section 1548(f)(2) to a child receiving care through a STRTP, there shall be a civil penalty of $2500.00. Under H&S 1548, \"physical abuse\" includes neglect as defined in 11165.2 of the Penal Code, when the person responsible for the child's welfare is a licensee, administrator, or employee of any facility licensed to care for children. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names Form, Appeal Rights, and the signed LIC 421-D (CRP) Civil Penalty Assessment - Death / Serious Bodily Injury / Physical Abuse were provided to the facility representative.",

Staff stated that children often are disrespectful towards staff, but children are redirected and encouraged to treat everyone kindly. Staff denied receiving reports of anyone complaining that staff were being disrespectful towards them. Interviews with children were similar in that children denied being treated disrespectfully at the home. One child stated that a staff that did treat them disrespectfully no longer worked at the facility would lie on them but denied that current staff treated anyone disrespectfully. It was also alleged facility does not have enough food for minors in care. Interviews conducted with staff were similar and staff denied the allegation. Staff stated that executive director goes grocery shopping on Tuesdays and buys ample food for all children in care. Additionally, if facility runs low on food staff will notify director and director will bring food when requested. Staff stated children are encouraged to participate in meal prep and cooking and have received no complaints regarding food being limited in the facility. Interviews conducted with children was similar in that children identified no issues with food or food amounts in the facility. Interviews with parole and county social workers identified no issues with the facility or children being placed in the facility. Documents reviewed identified no issues or concerns with staff being disrespectful towards children or facility not maintaining proper amounts of food. During initial inspection LPA McGee toured facility and observed ample food for children in care.

It was further alleged that S2 spoke to C1 in an inappropriate manner. LPA's investigation revealed that on October 26, 2024, at or around 5 p.m. through 6 p.m., C1 was eating dinner at the table along with S2 and S3, when C1 called S2 a \"fat bitch.\" This resulted in S2 reacting by pushing C1's face down into his plate of food, which busted C1's lip. C1 called S2 a \"bitch\" again, which resulted in S2 flipping a couch over that C1 was on, with C1 bumping his head on a wall. C1 called S2 a \"bitch\" again, causing S2 to lift C1 by his shirt, pinning him against a wall. After C1 showered, he saw S2 and told him \"your girlfriend sounds like a man,\" which resulted in S2 throwing a bottle of water at C1. C1 ran to the bathroom, with S2 flinching at C1, then telling C1 \"if you come out of that bathroom, I'm going to make you shit yourself.\" C1 then ran into C2's room, where S2 picked him up by hugging his legs, and carried him out, bumping C1's head on the thermostat, before setting C1 down in his own room. C1 was offered first aid and medical attention, which were both refused. Confidential interviews, provided consistent statements that corroborated the allegations. Based on LPA's interviews which were conducted and record reviews, including an Incident Report dated October 27, 2024 and a Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR) dated the same, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

    "narrative": "On January 6, 2025, the Department received a complaint alleging that staff used an inappropriate form of restraint with a minor in care. It was further alleged that the STRTP did not comply with reporting requirements. LPA's investigation revealed that C1 did yell at S1 and pushed S1 out of the room and continued to pursue S1. S1 reacted by grabbing hold of C1's forearms, and sweeping C1's leg, causing C1 to go to the floor during the encounter. S1 has not completed his Managing Aggressive Behavior (MAB) training, the intervention training that the facility has been approved for. Per the facility, employees who are not certified are not to restrain clients. C1's case plan calls for employees equipped in this training. Document review of the Incident Report (IR) submitted by the STRTP revealed that the IR did not contain specific information required by Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) for incidents documenting the use of manual restraints Confidential interviews indicated that a restraint of C1 occurred, whether out of self-defense or otherwise. Based on LPA's interviews which were conducted and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations, Title STRTP Interim Licensing Standards Chapter 7.5 (Version 5), Article 10. Application Procedures 87095.22(j), Emergency Intervention Plan, and Article 06.

This is an amendment of a report originally delivered 04/11/25, delivered on 05/02/25 by LPA Bonilla. On January 6, 2025, the Department received a complaint alleging that staff engaged in a physical altercation with a minor in care. It was also alleged that staff antagonize the minor in care, with staff not leaving him alone while client was having a crisis. It was alleged that staff did not report an incident involving minor in care as necessary. Furthermore, it was alleged that staff do not accord respect to minor(s) in care, entering the client's room and not leaving. LPA's investigation revealed that on January 2, 2025, client C1 was having a rough day, by his own account and by account of all others interviewed. Staff (S1) did approach C1 and was asked to leave. As S1 left, C1 pushed S1, with C1 engaging into physical contact with staff, who sought to avoid confrontation. Staff denied provoking the altercation, and stated that he was only trying to de-escalate the client's already tense mood, and left when asked. Staff state that they treat all clients with respect. Staff stated that they do not antagonize the clients. Confidential interviews provided conflicting information, neither corroborating nor refuting allegations. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are determined to be Unsubstantiated.

There were five incidents involving restraints which were not reported to the Department. Four staff were unable to explain to the LPA what the process is to report incidents. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. Three citations are being issued for violating Title 22, Division 6, Section 80028(a): Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision, Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87072(c)(17): Personal Rights, and Title 22, Division 6, Section 80061(b). A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and LIC-9099D were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted. Appeal rights were provided. Regarding allegations of staff not addressing minors' health care needs, interviews with staff and clients indicated the facility has a medic on site. However, some interviews denied medical care as being available for clients when asked. Staff and clients reported that clients had access to three meals and a snack daily, but statements differed regarding the quality and quantity of the snacks, and the process for how to address when a client misses a meal. One staff reported that if a client acts up, they are not given a meal. Interviews and record review were inconsistent regarding the allegations that staff inappropriately restrained a minor resulting in injuries, and staff handled minor in a rough manner. One staff reported observing another staff push a client against a wall, however, no clients interviewed corroborated this statement. Regarding the allegation of staff hitting a minor with a vehicle resulting in injuries, interviews were inconsistent. One client reported having stolen a golf cart at the facility, but not getting injured. No incident report was submitted to confirm any other client or staff involvement. Regarding the allegation of staff not intervening when a minor engaged in self-harm, interviews were inconsistent. An incident did occur in the stabilization room involving electrical wiring. Client and staff interviews provided inconsistent statements regarding whether the wiring was exposed or not, and accessible to clients. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegations may have happened, or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violations did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and appeal rights were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted.",

According to confidential interviews, staff was increased during nocturnal hours to provide additional supervision, as it was alleged that it was during the nighttime that the problems mostly occurred. The investigation did not produce evidence to indicate that altercations occurred due to lack of adequate supervision. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that staff do not provide adequate supervision resulting in minors engaging in physical altercations with other minors may have occurred or is valid, however, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "On 03/04/2021 at 10AM, an announced Office Meeting was held to discuss a substantiated allegation of a lack of care and supervision resulting in a minor physically assaulting another minor which resulted in the minor sustaining a concussion diagnosed by a physician. The meeting was conducted virtually over Microsoft Teams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Present in this meeting from Youth Homes Andersen were Administrator Donna Heimbruch and Youth Homes Director of STRTP Operations Ronnie Mabou. Present from Community Care Licensing (CCL) were Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong and Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont. The current census is 4 ambulatory female clients. On 02/14/2020, the Department received a complaint (Control #14-CR-20200214155207) alleging a lack of care and supervision resulted in a minor sexually assaulting another minor, a lack of care and supervision resulted in a minor physically assaulting another minor, and a client had access to knives. The investigation was referred to and conducted by the CCL Investigations Branch (IB). This investigation revealed that on 02/12/ C1 (Refer to LIC Confidential Names), while left unsupervised with C2 while on enhanced supervision protocol, got into a physical altercation with C1 that resulted in C1 sustaining a concussion and multiple nail avulsion while in care. Interviews with clients and staff reveal that C1 and C2 were left unsupervised while all staff on duty were outside preparing for a scheduled dump run. C1 and C2 engaged in a physical altercation in the upstairs hallway, which resulted in C2 hitting C1's head against the floor repeatedly. Another client in the home had to go downstairs and outside to grab staff's attention and alert them of the fight that had broken out in the house. (Continued on Lic809-c) Staff were able to separate the two clients, and determined that C1 needed to go to the Emergency Room due to complaints of headache and blurry vision. C1 also had several of her fingernails ripped off during this altercation. At the Emergency Room, C1 was given a primary diagnosis of nail avulsion and neck strain/sprain. The ER doctor advised staff to bring C1 back to the hospital on 02/14/2020 for a follow-up appointment, which was not scheduled or followed through with by the home. On 02/24/2020, C1 complained to staff that she was feeling pressure and pain in her head when she bent down, and staff took her to Contra Costa Health Services for a follow-up appointment, 12 days after the initial appointment. At this appointment, C1 was given a secondary diagnosis of concussion without loss of consciousness related to her head injury from the altercation on 02/12/2020. In order to determine the cause of C1's injuries, LPA Fremont interviewed D1 to confirm C1's diagnosis. D1 reviewed C1's initial visit report, and stated that given the notes from the doctor that treated C1 on 02/12/2020, C1 presented with a headache, blurry vision, stumbling, blood rushing to the head, dizziness, and nausea. D1 stated that these symptoms are indicative of a mild to moderate concussion, and speculated that C1 was not diagnosed with a concussion on 02/12/2020 because her symptoms were mild. D1 stated that the mechanism of injury paired with C1's presenting symptoms are clear and consistent with a mild to moderate concussion. D1 stated that while the first doctor did not diagnose a concussion, what they have in their notes is the most important thing to look at. D1 noted that when C1 returned to the hospital 12 days later, she presented with pain behind the ears, dizziness, and sensitivity to light and loud noises, which are all signs of a concussion. D1 stated a concussion can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks depending on the mechanism and severity of injury, and that was why she diagnosed C1 with a concussion at her follow-up appointment on 02/24/2020. D1 concluded this phone call by confirming that although the first doctor did not diagnose a concussion at the onset of symptoms, based on the doctor's notes of presenting symptoms and mechanism of injury, she is positive C1 had a concussion without loss of consciousness at the initial appointment, with symptoms that persisted for over a week resulting in the follow-up visit on 02/24/2020. (Continued on Lic809-c) On 09/04/2020, the Department issued substantiated findings for two of the three allegations for the 02/14/ Complaint (Control #14-CR-20200214155207). The allegations \"lack of supervision resulting in a client sexually assaulting another client\" and \"lack of care and supervision resulting in a client physically assaulting another client\" were substantiated, and a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Chapter 7.5, Version 3, Article 6, Section 87078(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision was issued. The Department has concluded an analysis and has determined that an Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted for serious bodily injury. The Penal Code \u00a7243 defines serious bodily injury as \"a serious impairment of physical condition, included, but not limited to, the following: loss of consciousness; concussion;bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ; a wound requiring extensive suturing; and serious disfigurement.\" Health and Safety Code \u00a71548(f)(1)(C) reads: \"For a violation that the department determines constitutes physical abuse, as defined in paragraph (2), or resulted in serious bodily injury, as defined in Section 243 of the Penal Code, to a person receiving care at a therapeutic day services facility, community treatment facility, transitional shelter care facility, transitional housing placement provider, small family home, crisis nursery, group home, enhanced behavior supports home licensed as a group home, or short-term residential therapeutic program, the civil penalty shall be assessed as follows: (f) Two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for a facility licensed to care for 40 or fewer children.\" Today, 03/04/2021, the Department will be issuing a Civil Penalty per Health and Safety Code \u00a71548(f)(1)(C) for $2,500. The above was reviewed during the meeting, and Appeal Rights were provided. This report was sent via email to Administrator Donna Heimbruch, who agreed to sign the report and email back to LPA Fremont for the home's facility file.",

S2 and S3 both stated that staff have been reliable throughout the pandemic, and continue to show up to all scheduled shifts to provide full coverage of the home. All staff interviewed also confirmed that though COVID-19 has prevented some in-person staff trainings, there has been an increase in the frequency of trainings, including topics such as: 1. Client supervision protocol 2. Nurtured Heart 3. COVID-19 protocol and procedures 4. Pro-Act 5. Trauma-Informed Care 6. AWOL protocol Although COVID-19 has prevented many planned activities in the community, all staff were able to confirm that there has not been a lapse in planned activities since the pandemic started. Staff have continued to schedule new activities for the clients, and have also incorporated a system where clients can request specific activities that are incorporated into the activities calendar. Some examples of recent activities are: 1. Arts and crafts 2. Halloween decoration contest 3. Board and Card Games 4. Physical activities such as staff/client basketball games LPA Fremont concluded this Case Management inspection by informing Administrator Shawntrelle Butler that another virtual Case Management inspection would be taking place in the next 3 months for the purpose of ensuring continued compliance from the facility. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Shawntrelle Butler with read receipt due to COVID-19 precautions.",

    "narrative": "S2 stated that C2 had bled where C1 had bitten and scratched her, but both clients declined medical attention. S3 also stated that 911 was called during the fight when staff noticed clients were bleeding from multiple areas on their arms, but both clients declined medical attention. S4 recalled seeing blood on both clients, but both declined medical attention and general first aid was administered on the scene. These statements are corroborated by an interview with C2 on 06/05/2020 at 2:20PM, who confirmed that she did suffer minor injuries from the fight, including bruises and a small area of torn skin that had bled where C1 bit her, but both clients declined medical attention. Based on the information gathered, including interviews with C2, S1, S2, S3, and S4, and review of incident reports and shift notes dated 03/04/2020 that describe injuries C1 and C2 sustained from their altercation, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove that C1 and C2 sustained injuries while in the care of the licensee, though both declined medical attention. Therefore, the allegation that a resident sustained an injury while in care is substantiated. Because both injured clients refused medical attention, and both were treated on scene where facility staff administered general first aid, no deficiency is being cited at this time. However, because C2 stated in her interview that C1 had bitten her, and due to the high risk for potential infection and disease transmission from human bites, an Advisory Note - Technical Advisory is being issued per Title Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80075(a) - Health Related Services.

LPA met with Administrator Shawntrelle Butler, who helped facilitate this inspection. Also in attendance were Youth Homes Vice President of Residential Services Shatae Jones, and Youth Homes Director of STRTP Operations Ronnie Mabou. Currently in care are 5 ambulatory clients. This virtual inspection is being held in lieu of a physical in-person visit to the facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2019, Youth Homes - Cherry Lane met with Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives for a Noncompliance Conference. The purpose of the Noncompliance Conference was to address the following issues: 1. Client care and supervision 2. Staffing ratios 3. Physical Plant of the home - specifically non-functional locks on client bedroom windows 4. Staff training 5. Planned activities On 03/02/2021 at 3:12PM, LPA Fremont contacted Administrator Butler by email to request the following documents: 1. January Program Standards Sub-Committee Board Meeting Minutes 2. Shift notes and room check logs for January 17, 2021 3. January 2021 activities calendar (both planned and updated versions) 4. October 2020-January 2021 training logs and sign-in sheets (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C) On 03/03/2021 at 2:49PM, LPA received all requested documents from Administrator Butler except for the Program Standards Sub-Committee Board Meeting Minutes. On 03/03/2021 at 3:05PM, LPA received the Board Meeting Minutes from Youth Homes Vice President of Residential Services Shatae Jones. During this inspection, LPA had a discussion with all present parties regarding the following topics: Physical Plant: All client bedroom window locks are functional and in place. The home recently closed temporarily to go through extensive renovations on the inside of the house. Renovations were successful and clients have since been placed back in care at Cherry Lane. The home is now planning renovations for the outside of the home, and will have a walkthrough of the home in the coming weeks to have plans made with a contractor. The home will submit renovation plans prior to commencement of said renovations. Staff Training: The home has been conducting monthly staff training. Facility administrators have received their initial 40-hour training again, all staff have had CSEC training, Introduction to Cultural Humility training, and weekly staff meetings to go over facility binders and staff log book updates. All staff have also received a refresher course on mandated reporting requirements. The home just started a 3 part series on Nurtured Heart Approach and Crisis Communication, and will soon be moving on to another series to update all staff on Pro-Act, crisis management, and manual restraints. Each series will be repeated twice so that if any staff miss the first round of training, they will have an opportunity to make up during the second round. There has also been an increase in focus on client Needs and Services Plans and making sure that lower level staff are aware of what each child's behaviors are and how to provide support for each child based off their individual plans. Upper level management has been encouraging stronger collaboration between staffing levels and communication with social workers regarding new and escalating behaviors. (Continued on Lic809-c) Care and Supervision: All parties indicated that the clients have been doing well since moving back to Cherry Lane, although they miss the relationships with their counterparts at the Youth Homes Pryor location. Administrator Butler indicated there have not been any issues with client supervision, and staff continue to conduct 15 minute client checks to ensure that all clients are safe and accounted for. Admin. Butler indicated there was one recent AWOL, but all clients have returned since and are doing well in the program. Planned Activities: Parties interviewed stated that clients have been playing board games, cooking, and baking. There is one client who enjoys cooking and she has had an opportunity to cook for the house a few times a week, as well as make revisions to the weekly menu. One child enjoys baking, and staff have been encouraging this as well. The clients play basketball outside the home, and also share a hoverboard that they like to play on. One of the newest clients used to go fishing before placement, so staff recently took them to Lafayette Reservoir to go fishing, and more trips are being planned. Staff are also planning a trip to the snow in the coming months. An outside agency recently \"adopted\" the clients' birthdays, and they are able to fulfill the children's birthday wishlists. There is also an outside organization providing food for the home, and staff have planned a youth cook-off utilizing this food. The organization also provides alternative foods that the kids may have not tried before, and staff are planning a taste-testing game. At this time, the home remains in compliance with Title 22 regulations. At this time, no deficiencies were observed or cited. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Shawntrelle Butler to be signed and returned for the home's facility file.",

    "narrative": "On 06/17/2020 at 2PM, LPA Fremont met with representatives of Cherry Lane over FaceTime to notify them of this allegation and to conduct interviews with staff and clients. During this meeting, LPA conducted the following interviews: S1 at 2PM, C3 at 2:20PM, S2 at 2:18PM, S3 at 2:25PM, S4 at 2:30PM, and S5 at 2:40PM. LPA attempted to interview C1 and C2 at this time, however C1 was away on AWOL, and C2 refused to give an interview. LPA also conducted interviews with S6 on 06/26/2020 at 9:46AM, and W1 on 06/17/2020 at 12:22PM. In an interview with W1, this witness stated that C1 and C2 had been running away multiple days per week and were sometimes gone for two nights at a time, only returning on the third day so their beds would be held. W1 had also heard from another client that C1 and C2 were engaging in Commercially Sexually Exploited Child (CSEC) behaviors while on AWOL in the surrounding community. S2 and S4 added to this statement, saying that they had heard C1 and C2 discussing wanting to make money and talking about a hotel. S2 also stated that the clients often returned from AWOL with money, and the clients refused to disclose where they got it. All staff interviewed stated that C1 and C2 had been AWOLing almost every day for a period of several weeks, sometimes leaving the facility multiple times in one day. This was corroborated by C3, who stated the clients were leaving almost every day. All staff stated that per facility protocol, when a child AWOL'd from the facility, staff would try to talk them down and would follow on foot or in the facility vehicle until they lost line of sight or it became too dangerous for staff to follow. S2 stated that there had been times where they could not follow C1 and C2 because they were the only staff on duty and could not leave the other residents. This is corroborated by a document titled \"Staff Training: Runaway Procedure\" sent to LPA Fremont on 06/19/2020 at 4:38PM. This document states the following: \"If a youth is seen leaving, always follow unless you are a single coverage and cannot leave the other youth.\" In an interview with S6, S6 stated that if any clients required a hire level of supervision, staffing would be increased to make up for the supervision needs of the other clients. All staff interviewed confirmed that no additional staff had been added to supplement supervision for C1 and C2. (Continued on Lic9099-c) When asked how the clients were getting out of the house, all staff stated that C1 and C2 either walked out of the font door, or climbed through the bedroom or bathroom windows. S4 stated the following: \"They are AWOLing so often at this point, most of the time they will say 'Hey I'm leaving' and walk out of the house, or they won't say anything and just walk out.\" This is corroborated by C3, who stated, \"It's a daily basis so it gets to a point where they [staff] can't do anything every time.\" When asked if C1 and C2's supervision needs had been updated in their Needs and Services Plans, S1 stated that changes had been made to reflect the clients' recurring AWOL behavior. This is contradicted by C2's Needs and Services Plan sent to LPA Fremont on 06/19/2020 at 4:38PM. In this plan dated 06/15/2020, it is stated that C2 was on \"normal\" supervision at the time, however it is also noted that C2 was at severe risk for AWOL behaviors. This plan also states that C2 was in possession of an unauthorized cellphone at the time, which they were using to set up AWOLs, and the client was AWOLing daily. When asked if they thought they were doing everything they could to prevent AWOLs, all staff stated they were, with the exception of S4, who stated \"yes and no\" and clarified that it depended on the staff and their comfort level with de-escalation and following clients. Based on the information gathered, including interviews with staff and clients and review of facility records, there is a preponderance of evidence that the supervision needs of C1 and C2 were not being met, allowing them to repeatedly AWOL from the facility by leaving through the front door. Based on a recent Administrative Action taken against the home for similar complaints and incidents, the home has put a plan in place to increase staffing, to increase the number of on-call Crisis Management Supervisors, and to regularly meet with clients' Child and Family Teams to address ongoing behavioral issues and to implement solutions to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Because of these recent changes, no deficiency is being cited at this time. To communicate best practice of client supervision going forward, an LIC9102 - Technical Violation was issued to the home for Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80078(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9102 for details. At this time, one Technical Violation has been issued per Title Regulations. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided and discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to Youth Homes Director of Operational Compliance Ronnie Mabou, to be signed and returned for the home's facility file.",

During a tour of the facility, LPA discovered two sharps in the kitchen, one vegetable peeler and one pizza cutter. LPA returned both sharps to the facility office to be locked away from client access. To communicate best practice when storing sharps and other hazardous items, an LIC9102 - Advisory Note was issued for California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 7, Section 80087(g) - Building and Grounds. Please see the attached LIC9102 for details. When taking temperatures of faucets which are in use by clients, LPA recorded the following temperatures: 1.

(Continued on Lic809-c) In order to be able to inspect files that were inaccessible at the time of this inspection, LPA Fremont will be continuing this Noncompliance Quarterly Inspection on a separate day, when personnel files and client files will be reviewed, and staff and client interviews will be conducted. _________________________________________________________________________ On 08/24/2021 at 1:25PM-4:15PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont returned to Youth Homes Cherry Lane to finish their Noncompliance Quarterly Case Management Inspection. LPA met with Administrator Rozalynn Johnson-Spearman, who helped facilitate this inspection. During this inspection, LPA Fremont conducted a confidential interview with Administrator Rozalynn Johnson-Spearman. Ms. Johnson-Spearman indicated that day to day operations have been running smoothly. There have been no significant client incidents over the last few months, and staff and clients have a good relationship. Staff training has had consistent attendance. There have been no issues with client supervision or staffing ratios. The home has provided clients with a large variety of on-site and community planned activities, and there have been no complaints about activities. LPA reviewed files for all youth currently in placement, and found that C2 was missing their immunization record and their physician's report was incomplete and missing physician signature. The facility also keeps all clients' Safeguard for Cash Resources and Centrally Stored Medications Destruction Records in common files. An LIC Advisory Note was issued to the home for CCR, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80070(a)(b)(1-14). Please see attached LIC9102 for details.

LPA is issuing one citation, per Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Personal Rights. See attached LIC 9099-D. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Director of Operational Compliance and Services Ronnie Mabou, whose signature on this form confirms receipt. Police did not aid further. Staff searched, but youth could not be located. Licensee responded to the incident and determined that staff did not make appropriate internal notifications and did not follow intervention procedures, including restraining to prevent further harm. Confidential interviews indicate that the facility does not restrain to prevent unauthorized absences, as that is not permitted, but youth was a threat to self and needed medical treatment, so restraining would have been required per their procedures. Staff were terminated. However, it is not clear that the facility is in violation of regulatory requirements for admitting youth. Neither youth is still in care, and the licensee has temporarily closed the facility pending hire of new staff. Additionally, based on confidential interviews, the facility faced a staffing shortage which made it difficult to maintain appropriate staff to child ratios. However, interviews do not clearly indicate instances of shortage resulting in not meeting ratio. Staff have worked overtime to maintain ratios. As stated above, it was reported that a staff member had been the sole staff at the facility in the morning when four youth were present, but the staff member denied this. Licensee has now closed the facility pending hire of new staff. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or is/are valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with residents and staff, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Director of Operational Compliance and Services Ronnie Mabou, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

During the investigation, it was disclosed that it was very easy to sneak drugs into the facility due to not being searched thoroughly. For example, on 10/25/2021, two clients took MDMA pills and were not checked on throughout the night. Two clients said that staff only checked when showing behaviors or smelling like marijuana and some staff are aware that client's smoke marijuana and drink alcohol and do not get in trouble if it is not on the property. Three staff were aware that youth would go into other youths' room even when they are not allowed and were aware of C1 and C2 (refer to 811) having sex with other clients inside the facility.

LPA met with Meghan Chapman, Lead Facility Manager. At the time of the visit, two staff members and three clients were present. The IR was submitted regarding an incident that occurred on July 21, 2025. According to the report, Client C1 allegedly snuck a male individual into their bedroom overnight. During the visit, LPA interviewed the Lead Facility Manager to obtain additional information regarding the facility's plan to ensure C1 received proper follow-up support. LPA confirmed that the awake overnight staff was conducting routine checks during the time of the incident. LPA reviewed the program statement, which includes a house rule stating: \"You have the right for staff to knock before entering your bedroom.\" On the night of the incident, C1 reportedly requested that staff knock before entering, and it is suspected the unauthorized individual may have used this to remain hidden. The facility assessed this incident, along with prior incidents involving the client creating an unsafe environment for others. As a result, a discharge plan was developed, and the client was formally discharged on July 28, 2025. LPA reviewed video footage of the incident, as well as shift logs from the night in question, and confirmed that room checks were being conducted. Two clients declined to be interviewed by LPA. One staff and one client interview were conducted during today's visit. An area of improvement was observed under California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Section 80078 - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision.

    "narrative": "During a complaint investigation at the facility on 03/02/2020, LPA Fremont reviewed C1's facility file, reviewed staff training material, C1's hospital visit records, incident reports for C1, and conducted an interview with S1. On 03/05/2020, LPA Fremont and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Saxon Turner traveled to Spectrum School in San Pablo, CA to interview C1. LPA returned to the home on 03/16/2020 with LPA Monica Pavia to obtain staff schedule for the week of the incident, and staff shift logs. At this time, LPAs also interviewed S2, S3 and S4. LPA Fremont traveled to Youth Homes - Pryor on 03/19/2020 to interview C3. Due to COVID- Shelter-In-Place directives, LPA Fremont conducted phone interviews with S5, S6, and S8 on 03/24/2020, S7, S9, S10, and S12 on 03/25/2020, and S11 on 03/26/2020. During interviews with C1 on 03/05/2020 at 12PM and C3 on 03/19/2020 at 9AM, LPA Fremont asked both clients what staff were usually doing when they are on shift. Both C1 and C3 stated that staff are usually on their phones, or watching TV in the living room. C1 also stated that they are not supposed to be in any part of the house or backyard without a staff member because they are on increased supervision. This is corroborated by C1's Needs and Services Plan, which stated that C1 was on 1:1 or line of sight supervision at the time, due to high frequency of AWOLs. This is also corroborated by staff training procedures which state, \"The counselors on duty should always be aware of where all youth are at any given time.\" This is contradicted by incident reports dated 02/16/2020 and 02/17/2020, which state that staff members saw C1 and C3 leaving the property by hopping a fence in the backyard, while staff watched on from inside the home. Upon further review of incident reports dated from 02/14/2020 to 02/28/2020, LPA Fremont found that clients at the home frequently AWOL'd from the home at night when only one staff member was on duty and could not follow them without abandoning the other clients in the home. This is corroborated by an interview with S9 on 03/25/2020 at 12:22PM, in which S9 stated that the home has one staff on duty after 10PM, and two staff who float between 4 homes in 3 different cities. When LPA Fremont asked S9 if there was any effort made to increase staffing during the night to deter AWOLs, S9 said no, no effort had been made to increase staffing. When LPA Fremont asked C1 and C3 what staff do when they try to run away, both C1 and C3 stated that staff let them go and rarely follow. This is corroborated by an interview with S12 on 03/25/2020 at 4:34PM, who stated, \"If I'm the only one on shift in the middle of the night, I let them go because I have to stay with the other clients.\" (Continued on Lic9099-c) In addition, it is stated in C1's Needs and Services Plan that they should be manually restrained during AWOL incidents because they can be a grave danger to themselves or others. When LPA Fremont asked all staff if they had ever used manual restraints on C1, all staff stated they never used manual restraints to prevent AWOL. This is contradicted by an interview with S1 on 03/02/2020 at 11:51AM, who stated, \"C1 is automatic hands on because of her history and knows staff will restrain her from AWOLing because it is in her treatment plan.\" S6 also stated in their interview on 03/24/2020 at 11:52AM that, \"It is the protocol to use restraints on C1 because she is high risk.\" This is also corroborated by the staff training manual which states, \"Residents are not to be restrained from leaving the program by physical force except in situations of extreme danger to self or others, which may be due to age and would be noted in the Individual Crisis Prevention Plans.\" Based on the information gathered, there is a preponderance of evidence that the facility did not provide adequate supervision of a minor. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per Title Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80078(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. During a review of C1's hospital visit records and interviews with S1 on 03/02/2020 at 11:51AM, it was found that though C1 returned from one AWOL on 02/17/2020, they were not taken to the hospital until 02/19/2020. S1 stated that C1 refused to go to the hospital, even though she had told staff on duty she had unprotected sexual intercourse with a man in the community while on AWOL. This is corroborated by interviews with S4 on 03/16/2020 at 9:36AM, and S12 on 03/25/2020 at 11:52AM, who both stated C1 told staff right away upon return from AWOL on 02/17/2020 that she had unprotected sexual intercourse with a man in the community and she thought she might be pregnant. Medical records show C1 was taken to John Muir Medical Center on 02/19/2020 for a pregnancy test and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) screening, and returned on 02/21/2020 to have test results delivered. Furthermore, multiple staff interviews, as well as review of incident reports, show C1 returned from an AWOL with C3 on 02/21/2020, and C1 immediately told staff she had sexual intercourse with C3 multiple times while on AWOL. Medical records for C1 show that after this incident, C1 was not taken to the hospital for a pregnancy test and STI screening until 02/28/2020. (Continued on Lic9099-c) Based on the information gathered, there is a preponderance of evidence that the facility did not seek timely medical care for a minor. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. A deficiency is being cited per Title Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80075(a) - Health Related Services. Please see the attached LIC9099-D for details. At this time, two deficiencies are being cited.

    "narrative": "This allegation \"Staff fractured foster child's shoulder\" is in reference to C1 reporting that an incident occurred at the home in which S2 had picked him up and slammed him on the ground, fracturing his shoulder. In C1's medical record received on 06/29/2020, a report dated 02/05/2020 states that an X-ray was taken of C1's shoulder and showed a fracture of the proximal end of his right humerus with lateral displacement. A follow-up report from 03/13/2020 shows that C1 had another X-ray and was given a sling and Range of Motion exercises to aid his rehabilitation. Finally, a psychiatric evaluation of C1 on 03/28/2020 states that C1 reported getting into multiple altercations at the group home in the recent past prior to fracturing his shoulder. On 06/05/2020, Inv. McIntosh received a text message from S1, containing a video clip which showed C1 and C2 wrestling in the facility, and C2 slamming C1 into a table. This video was dated 02/02/2020. In an interview with C1 on 07/17/2020 at 1522 hours, C1 reported they had not seen or experienced any inappropriate interactions while residing at East Bay Shelter. C1 reported to this agency that on 02/04/2020, he was outside playing basketball at the home when S2 came outside and told him it was time to come inside. C1 states he refused, and in response S2 came out, picked up C1, threw him a few feet in the air, and C1 landed on his shoulder causing the fracture. C1 reported to this agency there were no other witnesses, and cameras in view of the incident were not functional at the time. When asked about the video of C1 and C2 wrestling in the facility, C1 stated he could not recall the date it was taken but thought it was from 1-1.5 weeks before he injured his shoulder. C1 identified the other child in the video as C2, and stated he did not sustain any injuries from this altercation, other than hitting his right elbow on the corner of the table. When asked if he played any sports that could have caused his injury, C1 stated he did not play any sports. This statement is inconsistent with a note sent home by W2 on 02/04/2020, which was sent to report to the home that C1 had complained of pain in his right shoulder after playing football earlier in the day. (Continued on Lic9099-c) An interview with C3 on 10/08/2020 at 1226 hours contradicts the statements given by C1. C3 stated in their interview that C1 was lying about the incident with S2, and that it had never happened. C3 stated S2 caught C1 trying to climb through a female client's bedroom window, and S2 pulled C1 away from the window. C3 reported to this agency that C1 got made at S2 and told C3 he was going to get the home shut down. This is corroborated by Pleasant Hill Police Department Report #20-02-19-0055, which reports that C1 had made statements to S2 such as \"I'm going to get you fired\" and \"I'm going to get this [place] shut down.\" Finally, C3 admitted to this agency that they were the one that had filmed the altercation between C1 and C2, but they did not think anyone had been injured as a result of the interaction. In an interview with W1 on 10/12/2020 at 1531 hours, W1 stated that C1 had told them about his shoulder hurting during a passing conversation at the home in the days following the alleged incident. W1 reported to this agency that C1 had stated his injury was the result of staff actions, but that C1 was elusive about the conversation and was smiling throughout the interaction. In an interview with W2 on 10/26/2020 at 1133 hours, W2 reported to this agency that on 02/04/2020, C1 had reported his right shoulder was hurting after landing on it during football in his Physical Education class. W2 reports they wrote a note to the home to report C1's injury. In an interview with W3 on 11/12/2020 at 0801 hours, W3 reported to this agency that C1's X-ray showed an early callus of the proximal humerus fracture, indicating the fracture was a few days old at the time the client presented at urgent care with his injury. W3 indicated this type of injury would have been caused by blunt trauma to the shoulder area, and could have been the possible result of being slammed into a table OR from someone throwing the client into the air onto the ground. In an interview with S3 on 11/17/2020 at 1155 hours, S3 reported to this agency they were unaware of any incident involving C1 other than the altercation with C2, which they were present for. S3 stated C1 was touching C2, they started arguing, and C2 slammed C1 onto the kitchen table. S3 reported that C1 later complained his shoulder and arm hurt, and S3 was told later that day that C1 had also reported pain to S2. S3 was unaware of any incident involving C1 and S2. (Continued on Lic9099-c) In an interview with S2 on 11/23/2020 at 1628 hours, S2 reported to this agency that he had caught C1 trying to sneak through the bedroom window of a female client at the home, and S2 was also aware of the altercation between C1 and C2. S2 stated that after they caught C1 trying to sneak through the window, C1 blamed his shoulder injury on S2. S2 also recalls a day around the same time when staff were asked to come pick C1 up from school after injuring his upper body, but S2 was unaware of what happened, only stating this had happened before C1 sustained his shoulder injury. S2 denies throwing C1 on the ground, stating it would be impossible due to them being the same height and weight. This is contradicted by observations of C1 by this agency and examination of S2's driver's license which shows C1 and S2 are not of similar height or weight. S2 concluded their interview by reporting that C1 eventually apologized to him after the window incident. Finally, contact with Pleasant Hill Police Department Detective D1 on 08/11/2020 at 1107 hours confirms that D1 did not pull a case for this matter, and D1 indicated they could not substantiate the allegation due to conflicting statements. Review of Pleasant Hill Police Department Report #20-02-19-0055 also stated that Youth Homes conducted an internal investigation into this matter and reported conflicting statements from all parties and witnesses. This report continues that through further investigation in conjunction with Child Protective Services (CPS), this allegation could not be substantiated due to lack of evidence and conflicting statements. Based on the information gathered, including review of facility records, police records, medical records, and interviews with clients, staff, and witnesses, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that C1 sustained a fractured shoulder from being slammed onto the ground by S2. Although the allegation \"Staff fractured foster child's shoulder\" may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation did or not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. At this time, no deficiency is being cited. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Felicia Martin with read receipt, to be signed and returned over email due to COVID-19 precautions.",

    "narrative": "During an initial 10-Day Complaint Investigation Inspection at the facility on 03/18/2020 at 12:25PM, LPA Fremont met with Administrator Felicia Martin to discuss the nature of the complaint. Because this complaint is regarding the same incident as the complaint 14-CR-20200224152019 dated 02/24/2020, LPA Fremont only requested a copy of an incident report dated 02/19/2020. For this investigation, on the advice of Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Saxon Turner, LPA Fremont used documents and interviews from the complaint dated 02/24/2020 for relevant fact-finding. (See LIC811 - Confidential Names dated 02/23/2021) During an interview with S1 on 03/02/2020 at 11:51AM, LPA inquired about what C1 had disclosed to staff about their frequent AWOL's the weekend of 02/14/2020-02/17/2020. S1 stated that C1 admitted to having sex with another boy who wasn't a client, as well as C3, and \"the weed man.\" S1 also stated that when C1 and C3 returned from one of their AWOLs, staff observed that both clients were covered in leaves from the trees outside. This is corroborated by an incident report dated 02/21/2020, which states that \"S4 and S3 observed C1 and C3 running out the back door of the home and hopping the fence in the backyard. Upon return, C1 told staff that they had sex with C3 multiple times while on AWOL.\" This is also corroborated by an incident report dated 02/16/2020-02/17/2020, which states that C1 and C AWOL'd and C2 sold C1 to a homeless man in the community for \"$2 and a bag of weed.\" During an interview with C1 on 03/05/2020 at 12PM, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Saxon Turner asked C1 what they told staff after they came back from this particular AWOL. C1 answered that she told staff she had sex with a man in the community. When LPM Turner asked C1 how staff reacted to this statement, C1 stated they said \"Okay.\" During this same interview with C1 on 03/05/2020 at 12PM, LPM Turner also asked C1 about supervision at the facility. C1 stated that staff are on their phones a lot of the time. This is corroborated by an interview with C3 on 03/19/2020 at 9AM, who stated staff were on heir phones during shift. LPM Turner asked C1 what staff usually do when the clients try to run away, and C1 stated \"They let me go, they only tried to follow me once.\" (Continued on Lic9099-c) LPM Turner asked if C1 was allowed to go outside, and C1 responded that they weren't allowed outside without a staff member because they are on line-of-sight supervision. This is corroborated by the Needs and Services Plan for C1 at the time, which also states C1 was on line-of-sight supervision, and manual restraints were permitted to prevent AWOL. This is contradicted by an incident report dated 02/21/2020 which states that staff watched C1 and C3 go outside and jump the fence. Based on the information gathered, there is a preponderance of evidence that the facility did not provide adequate supervision of a minor, and that a lack of supervision by the facility resulted in inappropriate actions between minors. Therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. Because the home has been cited for Lack of Care and Supervision for a previous complaint (14-CR-20200224152019 dated 02/24/2020), which was regarding the same incident as this complaint, and because the home has shown significant improvement in providing care and supervision based on each client's Needs and Services Plans, no deficiency is being cited at this time. An Advisory Note LIC9102 was issued for California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 6, Section 80078(a) - Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Please see the attached LIC9102 for details. At this time, no deficiencies are being cited. One Advisory Note was issued per Title 22 regulations. An exit interview was conducted, Appeal Rights provided, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Felicia Martin with read receipt due to COVID-19 precautions.",

There are currently six clients in care. LPA Ng received a video showing a mouse crawling in the client's room and also received a picture of a mouse trap. In the video received, the mouse was behind a light brown dresser. In the second video, it shows the mouse standing on the blue rug in the middle of the room. The mouse trap was located in between the light brown dresser and a skateboard. At 10: AM, LPA Ng and Balhotra conducted an inspection of the facility grounds. The facility has four bedrooms, a kitchen, dining room and living room and two bathrooms. LPA's toured the facility and while observing a bathroom, there was a door that is locked with a broken door siding that the lock was attached to. LPA Balhotra mentioned that the door needed to be fixed due to it being a safety hazard. S1 mentioned she has a work order for it. LPA Ng and Balhotra toured the rest of the facility and no safety hazards were present. LPA Ng and LPA Balhotra discussed the reason for the inspection with S1 and S2. S1 stated that they called the Terminix and the company was here on 1/11/2022. In addition, S2 was able to provide a invoice from Terminix for 12/08/2021 and 01/11/2022 with their next appointment being on 2/9/2022 from 2- PM.

The purpose of the inspection was to follow up on an incident involving a sexual relationship with former staff and client. LPA Ng reviewed the IB report for complaint # 14-CR-20220415161702. The allegation, staff engaged in inappropriate behavior with client, and found that both staff and client confirmed that they were in a sexual relationship but denied that staff was employed at the facility during that time. The investigator, Shannon Borton asked staff if they were aware of the relationship. Some staff heard about the client being in a relationship with an adult and some said they were unaware. The staff that heard about it stated that they found out after the client left Youth Homes- East Bay. LPA Ng asked Ronnie Mabou, Administrator the procedures for incidences like this and how staff use prudent parenting to ensure clients are getting the services they need. What kind of services, what staff are communicating to clients, and how often they check in with clients regarding safe sex and other health services. No deficiencies were cited today.

    "narrative": "On 07/27/2020, LPA Balhotra traveled to the home to notify the licensee of this allegation, to tour the facility, and to conduct interviews with staff and clients. During this inspection, LPA Balhotra conducted interviews with the following clients and staff: C1, C2, C3, C4, S1, S2, and S3. In an interview with S1, S2 stated they had not personally witnessed rodents in the home, but had heard other staff and clients say they had seen them in the home. S1 stated that a client had recently caught a mouse in the snack closet, and Clark Pest Control came to the home the same day to remove it. In an interview with S2, S2 stated they had seen pests in the home, and that Clark Pest Control came out on a regular basis to set and remove traps. S2 stated they have started storing food in plastic bins with lids to try to mitigate the problem. S2 also stated they has personally seen pests in the pantry, garage, and living room. In an interview with S3, S3 stated they had seen a mouse approximately one month earlier, and two were caught in traps in the garage. S3 stated Clark Pest Control regularly came out to the home to set and remove traps. S3 stated the home is always kept clean, and staff deep clean every night. In interviews with C1, C2, C3, and C4, all clients confirmed they had seen pests in the house, specifically mice. C1 stated they had seen mice in the kitchen, and they thought the problem was that the garbage cans were kept in the garage. C2 stated they also saw a mouse in the kitchen, and they believed the rodents were coming in through a hole in the baseboards underneath the dishwasher. This is corroborated by a photo taken by LPA Balhotra during this inspection, which shows a small hole between the dishwasher and the floor where there is a missing piece of baseboard. C2 stated the house is always clean, and they believed the mice were coming in the house from the surrounding fields because the area is hot and dry. C3 and C4 stated they had also seen mice in the kitchen, and that Clark Pest Control frequently came to the house to spray for bugs and to set and remove rodent traps. C4 stated they had seen a dead mouse stuck in a glue trap in the kitchen, and sent a picture of the mouse to LPA Balhotra to verify this statement. The photo shows a Clark Pest Control employee holding a glue trap with a mouse caught in the glue. Other photos taken by LPA Balhotra during this inspection show rodent droppings in the cabinet under the kitchen sink, and a hole in the wall underneath the kitchen sink where the pests could possibly be coming through. (Continued on Lic9099-c) On 08/28/2020 at 9:01AM, LPA Fremont received an email from Administrator Christal Black, which contained copies of invoices from Clark Pest Control for pest treatments. The first invoice dated 03/03/2020 states that Clark removed one dead mouse from a garbage can in the backyard. The second invoice dated 05/05/2020 states the Clark employee de-webbed around the windows and doors, treated for spiders, ants, wasps, and roaches, and set glue boards in the garage, kitchen, and pantry. The third invoice dated 07/14/2020 states the Clark employee de-webbed around the windows and doors, and treated the home for ants, spiders, wasps, and roaches. Finally, the fourth invoice dated 08/20/2020 states the Clark employee who conducted the inspection found no signs of bed bugs, and no signs of rodents in the home. Because of this, no chemicals or additional glue boards were applied to the home to continue pest mitigation. Based on the information gathered, including LPA observations, records review, and interviews with staff and clients, there is a preponderance of evidence that the facility had mice coming into the home at the time this complaint was received in July 2020. Therefore, the allegation \"Facility has pests\" is substantiated. Because of the licensee's continued efforts to eradicate rodents and bugs from the home through the regular utilization of pest control treatments by Clark Pest Control, and based on Clark Pest Control finding no sign of rodents in the home in August 2020, no deficiency is being cited at this time. An Advisory Note was issued for California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 7, Section 80087(a) - Buildings and Grounds. Please see the attached LIC9102 for details. At this time, no deficiency is being cited. One LIC9102 - Advisory Note was issued. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Christal Black for the home's records.",

The facility has not been operating since September of 2021 so the facility has been vacant. Therefore, LPA Ng did not use Inspection Tool during todays inspection. Please note, the facility has been in communication with CCL regards to their current status. LPA Ng toured the facility inside and out and found the facility to be safe and clean. Administrator Christal informed LPA Ng that repairs will be completed once they decide to open back up. There were some drywall patches and wood panels showing. During LPA Ng's walk thru, LPA observed the facility having some items packed in plastic bins for storage. The refrigerator and freezer were empty. LPA toured the upstairs and there were a total of 4 client bedrooms in the facility. Two of the client bedrooms are shared and two are single occupancy. All bed rooms were empty and three were storing plastic bins, mattresses, and bed frames. There are three bathrooms. One bathroom is located downstairs. The downstairs bathroom is only designated for the clients that live downstairs and the upstairs bathroom for the clients that stay upstairs. The staff bathroom is located in the staff office. Cleaning supplies, medication cabinet, and sharps are locked and located in the staff office. The Administrator stated that the listed facility is rarely in use. There was one occasion was when a client had COVID and one time when clients would go out on their outings and want a place to hang out. LPA Ng also advised the facility to check in with LPA when deciding to open back up so LPA can know what the facility current status is.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that around April 2023, facility staff improperly restrained one client in care on multiple occasions which resulted in minor scratches. In an interview conducted, one client stated that facility staff were physically rough when conducting manual restraints but denied any type of physical abuse or corporal punishment in the facility. The client stated that in one instance, they sustained some minor scratches on their body as a result of being manually restrained. In an interview conducted, a second client denied any type of physical abuse or corporal punishment in the home and also denied that staff would be unnecessarily rough during manual restraints. In interviews conducted, three staff members denied the allegation and stated that the client in question exhibited a lot of behaviors that were physically dangerous to others as well as to themselves. As a result, they have had to use manual restraints on a more frequent basis with the client. Staff stated that there was one instance in which the client had to be held in a prone position and sustained a rug burn from the carpet. Staff stated that the client did not initially report this to them as they felt that it was an accident and not a serious injury. However, staff have began conducting more thorough body checks every time manual restraint is used since then. Staff stated that they receive manual restraint training every year through a qualified, contracted instructor. LPA reviewed facility video footage of instances in which the client had to be manually restrained. In the video footage, LPA observed instances in which the client was physically violent towards others as well as themselves, suggesting that manual restraint was necessary in those moments. LPA did not observe any indication of malice or intentional roughness on the part of staff conducting the manual restraints. A review of records revealed that the facility properly logged instances of manual restraint in the facility. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to suggest that the allegation occurred. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegation is deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED.

In an interview conducted, the caregiver stated that she was changing another minor in care when one minor who was jumping/playing on the bed fell and hit their face against the edge of the bedframe. The caregiver stated that she took the child to the emergency room and the child was discharged without a CT scan. The caregiver stated that the physician did not have any immediate concerns and instructed her to monitor the child for symptoms of a concussion. No follow-up visits was reportedly necessitated unless a change in condition was observed. Due to the age and cognitive conditions of the children, interviews were unable to be held. A review of records confirmed that a visit with the physician was conducted and that no follow-up visits were necessitated. An interview conducted with the county worker revealed no concerns of a lack of supervision or neglect by the caregiver. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to suggest that the above allegation occurred.

Page 3 see page 4 continuation Observations made with possible health and safety concerns: 1.On 7/20/ Staff#1 observed in facility not cleared handling files and assisting with client.

Based on the information gathered during confidential interviews, relevant parties denied the allegations indicating C1 has been taken to the dentist twice and each time C1 has become aggressive towards the dentist. The dentist has requested C1 be sedated, and AD is waiting for C1's social worker to get court approval for C1 to be put under anesthesia. C1 has been enrolled in school however since C1 does not have any pervious education history, C1 needs an individualized education plan (IEP) to determine if C1 will be enrolled in person school or be home schooled. LPA reviewed doctor visit notes which indicate C1's prescription for Clonidine is not working and a letter dated October 5, 2023, indicated it was advised C1 stop taking Clonidine patch and Clonidine due to C1 being allergic. Doctor's notes indicated C1 was seen by a doctor on 6/1/23, 6/8/23, 7/25/23 and 10/5/23. AD indicated C1 had a modified bed due to C1's weight and C1's pervious social worker had approved the bed. AD stated C1 now has a single bed that accommodates C1's size. LPA observed a single bed when LPA visited the facility. AD sent a picture of C1's bed which shows C1 has a single bed. FYA indicated C1 is enrolled in school and is waiting for a final decision on if C1 will attend in person school or be home school.

S1 excused herself for not being home to greet LPA's arrival, but stated where she had been, and took over the tour of the home. Individual and confidential interviews with S1, DSP, S2 and S3 were consistent in telling of S1's morning errand routine. It was also alleged that S1 is not at the facility the required amount of time. Confidential interviews with S1, DSP, S2, and S3 were consistent in placing S1 as regularly present at the home and providing for regular supervision of C1 by responsible staff in the event S1 was absent while on errands for the home and/or C1. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the following issues and concerns with the Licensee for Aloe Special Care Homes regarding Title Continuing Care Requirements Section 80010(a) Limitations on Capacity and Ambulatory Status. On 8/27/ Community Care Licensing (CCL) conducted an unannounced annual inspection and cited the SFH for allowing adult clients to live at the facility. Upon file review CCL determined that all clients in placement were over the age of 22 years. Licensee stated that they have always wanted to continue the care of the client's longer term, as they had them since the age of 3 years. Licensee stated that they had no intention to be out of compliance of Title Regulations as they had submitted an application and were licensed to provide services for adult clients at the Fountain Valley facility, however Regional Center delayed the process which brought them to their current status. Licensee stated they have submitted a new application to the Adult Senior Residential Care application unit on 9/13/24. Licensee changed original plan of having the Fountain Valley Home vendorized by Regional Center to serve the adults clients, as it would be more efficient to change location of the SFH to the Fountain Valley location and turn the current SFH into a licensed Adult Residential Facility for the clients to remain in the same home. LPM Ortiz stated the application was received by the Application Unit on 9/17/24, in addition, there has been communication with the Application Unit and there is an understanding that the application will be expedited. . LPM Valenzuela asked Regional Center Representatives regarding the length of time it will take the Regional Center to approve the vendorization of the Adult Residential Facility. Regional Center Representative Jacqueline Puente stated they could not confirm a timeframe, however David Chase stated he believes it can be approved by 9/23/24. David stated he has been in communication with Regional Center and has made requested revisions to their Program Statement. On 9/19/24 the following plan was identified: \u00b7 Licensee submitted Adult Residential Facility application on 9/13/24 to the Adult Application Unit. \u00b7 Application was received on 9/17/24 and will be expedited. \u00b7 LPA Munoz will communicate weekly with the Licensee. If there are any modifications to the current plan or there are any questions, please contact LPA Guadalupe Munoz at guadalupe.munoz@dss.ca.gov or (949) 701-3475. A copy of this report was reviewed and provided to Licensee David Chase. The signed report will be placed in the facility file.",
