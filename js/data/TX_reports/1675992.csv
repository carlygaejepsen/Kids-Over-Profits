By implementing these steps, we can ensure that our organization is well-structured, organized, and knowledgeable, ensuring us to work cohesively as a team."""
12/21/2023,748.2551(c)(2) - Individual Standards Evaluated,Individual Standards Evaluated,No,02/16/2024,02/14/2024,Individual Standards Evaluated,High,Yes,The victim child and several children who witnessed the restraint indicated that the staff used more physical force than required while conducting the restraint.  ,"I, Andrew Ward, received the following email from Eric Harris:

Licensing officials recently investigated at our facility regarding a two-person restraint that was performed on a child. After their thorough examination, it was determined that Adiee Emergency Shelter failed to meet the minimum standard 748.2551 (c) (2) for EBI implementation. Specifically, it was found that caregivers did not use the minimal amount of reasonable and necessary physical force.

To rectify this deficiency and ensure the safety and well-being of all children, RCC will undertake the following corrective actions.


1. Review and Update Policies: We will carefully evaluate our current policies concerning physical force used during child restraints. We will ensure that these policies align with best practices, local laws, and regulations. If necessary, we will make updates to clearly emphasize the importance of minimal force and prioritize the child's safety.

2. Training and Education: Comprehensive training will be provided to all staff members involved in restraining children. This training will cover important topics such as child development, de-escalation techniques, and alternative methods of restraint that do not involve physical force. Staff members will be educated on the potential risks of excessive force and the vital importance of using the least amount of physical force necessary.

3. Clear Guidelines: We will develop clear guidelines and protocols for staff to follow when restraining a child. These guidelines will strongly encourage the use of non-physical techniques whenever possible. They will also outline the specific circumstances in which physical force may be deemed necessary. We will ensure that these guidelines are easily accessible, well-communicated, and regularly reviewed with all staff members.

4. Continuous Supervision: We will implement a system of continuous supervision, where staff members will actively monitor and assess a restrained child's behavior and needs. This proactive approach will allow for early intervention and minimize the need for physical force.

5. Regular Evaluation and Feedback: Conduct regular evaluations of staff performance and provide constructive feedback. Encourage open communication to address any concerns or questions regarding the use of physical force on child restraints. This will help maintain accountability and ensure that staff members are consistently following the established guidelines.

6. Reporting and Documentation: Establish a clear procedure for reporting and documenting instances where physical force is used on a child restraint. This will help identify any patterns or area.

implementing these corrective actions will enhance the safety and well-being of the children under our care. We fully understand the importance of using only the minimal amount of reasonable and necessary physical force. We will do everything in our power to ensure that all children receive the utmost care and protection they deserve.

We acknowledge the seriousness of this issue and the violation of Minimum Standard 748.2003(b)(3) regarding the administration of prescription medication. We are committed to ensuring the health and well-being of all children in our care and understand the importance of administering medication according to instructions or a prescribing healthcare professionals order.

In response to this, we have implemented a corrective action plan. The LCCA will ensure all children in our care do not miss doses of medication. The following measures have been put in place:

1. The case worker is no longer allowed to leave the resident at the facility without 30 days of medication.
2. Placement agencies have been notified of the final changes to the intake process when placement is occurring with the child.
3. If the child does not have the proper amount of medication, the placement will be denied until the medication is received.

In addition, the medication is currently being counted by the incoming staff with the staff that is present at shift change. We have also requested that placement agencies do not send children to the facility with less than 30 days of medication.

Currently, the medication is correct for all our residents. We believe these measures will ensure that our residents do not miss their medication and that we follow all relevant standards.

During a Heightened Monitoring Inspection conducted 12/11/2023, medications were counted, and documentation was reviewed. The standard was found to be in compliance.

09/25/2023,748.535(2) - Individual Standards Evaluated,Individual Standards Evaluated,No,09/26/2023,09/25/2023,Individual Standards Evaluated,Medium High,Yes,"During a review conducted on September 25, 2023, it was determined that: 

(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan(s); and 

(2)	12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.

As you know, the heightened monitoring plans for your operation included a specific planned end date at the 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plans, your operation is now unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring.  Furthermore, your operations planned end date must now be revised, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended.

Further details of the failure of your operations administrator to ensure compliance include the following: 

-	Your operation received a Medium-High weighted citation in a pattern/trend category on March 31, 2023. Specifically, the operation was cited for 748.3353(c)- Monitoring Devices. The operation met compliance April 13, 2023. 

-	Operation failed to demonstrate 6 months of successive compliance with the standard and contract requirements that led to heightened monitoring; and

-	Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations. 

Finding: 748.535(2)  The licensed administrator must ensure the operation complies with current heightened monitoring plans.
","An HM extension was approved effective 9/25/2023.  In conjunction with this extension, a new deadline was established by which all requirements must be completed by your CPA/GRO in order for the operation to be released from its HM plan and move to the Post-plan Monitoring Stage of HM.  Because the extended deadline is now effective, HHSC has determined that the operation is compliant with the requirements of 26 TAC 748.535(2).  The HM deadline for your operation has been extended by 6 months and the new deadline is 3/26/2024.  "
