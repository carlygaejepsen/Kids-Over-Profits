The operation emailed the following corrective action on 08/05/25: Immediate Remedial Action:
o	Safe Haven Youth Ranch has transitioned to using Brookshire Brothers Pharmacy #11, Brenham, TX, as our primary local pharmacy to ensure timely access to prescribed medications for all youth in care.
o	This change was implemented to reduce delivery delays and avoid the risk of medication lapses caused by supply shortages or out-of-stock situations at prior providers.
Medication Procurement Procedure Update:
o	If a prescribed medication is unavailable at our primary pharmacy, staff are now required to immediately contact the Program Director/Case Manager and an alternate pharmacy to secure the medication before the current supply is depleted (if applicable).  If a prescribed medication is not covered by medical insurance, but available, the Program Director or Case Manager will secure funding to pay for the required medication.
o	Case Managers and staff trained in distributing medication will maintain a list of two backup pharmacies to expedite the fulfillment of prescriptions.
Staff Training and Accountability:
o	All designated medication administrators have received refresher training on HHSC requirements for medication administration, emphasizing the importance of ensuring uninterrupted medication regimens.
o	Training includes protocols for checking medication supply levels 57 days prior to depletion and initiating refill or alternative pharmacy procedures promptly.
o	Documentation of pharmacy contact efforts will be logged in the youths medical file.
Ongoing Compliance Monitoring:
o	The Program Director will conduct monthly audits of medication administration records (MARs) to verify compliance with prescribing instructions and timeliness of refills.
o	Any identified delays or lapses will be reviewed, corrective measures implemented, and findings documented in compliance reports for licensing.
Preventive Measures:
By utilizing a local, reliable pharmacy partner and implementing a proactive monitoring process, Safe Haven Youth Ranch will ensure that all medications are administered exactly as prescribed, without lapse, in compliance with HHSC regulations and the childs healthcare plan.

The operation emailed the following corrective action on 08/05/25: Safe Haven Youth Ranch will conduct a thorough review of each childs Medication Logs to ensure full compliance with medication error reports to explain any discrepancies in regard to the administration of medication for a child.

Step 1: Medication Error Discovery
When a medication error is found regarding a prescribed medication, the team member who found the error must contact a health-care professional immediately (unless the youth received the medication at the wrong time or a medication dose was skipped or missed) and follow the health-care professionals recommendations.

When a medication error is found regarding a non-prescribed medication, the team member who found the medication error must take the appropriate and necessary actions as required by the circumstances.

Step 2: Medication Error Documentation
For all medication errors, the following will be documented within 24 hours:
- the time and date of the error;
- the explanation of medication error;
- the time and date of the call(s) to the licensed health-care professional (if applicable);
- the name and title of the health-care professional contacted (if applicable); and
- the health-care professionals medical recommendations for ensuring the youths safety (if applicable).
 
Step 3: Regulatory Oversight and Corrective Action
To limit the number of team members involved in the medication administration process, only Supervisors, Managers, and the Program Administrator are trained and approved to dispense medication. Additionally, a QA Medication Technician has been contracted to support with reviewing medication logs as further oversight and a quality assurance effort in the proper administration of medication.

Quality Assurance Process:
A QA Medication Technician has been contracted to support as an additional layer of quality assurance when reviewing medication logs for further oversight in the proper administration of medication. The findings from the medication log review is then shared with the Program Manager and Program Administrator for further follow-up as determined necessary.

Leadership Oversight:
The Director of Regulatory Compliance and Quality Improvement and the LCCA provide oversight by reviewing medication compliance data during monthly quality assurance meetings. They audit logs for accuracy, monitor for patterns of errors, and develop corrective actions accordingly. Any significant medication errors are escalated for immediate review and response in accordance with state regulations and agency policy.

Where Documented:
Safe Haven Youth Ranch maintains all documentation related to All medication administration logs, incident reports, and medication error reports in each childs file within the Extended Reach database.

Responsible Management:
The QA Medication Technician in collaboration with the Program Administrator is primarily responsible for implementing Medication Error Documentation Compliance. This includes overseeing medication log reviews, coordinating training, ensuring timely documentation, and verifying compliance with Minimum Standards. In the event the QA Medication Technician is unavailable, the Program Manager or LCCA will temporarily assume responsibility for these duties to ensure uninterrupted compliance monitoring and accurate documentation.

The Director of Regulatory Compliance and Quality Improvement provides oversight to guarantee consistent adherence, accountability, and regulatory compliance throughout the process.
