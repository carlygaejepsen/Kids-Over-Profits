We are implementing a comprehensive training strategy to ensure all staff members are properly trained and retrained in Trauma-Informed Behavior Interventions (TRBI) and Managing Aggressive Behaviors. The training department will facilitate weekly ""Lunch and Learn"" sessions at noon, providing an informal and supportive environment for staff to refresh their skills and knowledge, as well as participate in ongoing discussions and check-ins regarding the management of challenging behaviors.
Leadership personnel, including Case Managers, lead direct care staff, the Assistant Director, and the Director, will be tasked with providing additional oversight and support to caregivers. This will ensure that staff members are equipped to work effectively with youth experiencing trauma and that a more collaborative and supportive approach is adopted in daily interactions.
Feedback mechanisms will be established to allow staff to voice concerns or suggestions regarding the implementation of the training and any challenges faced in applying these new strategies. This feedback will be reviewed regularly to facilitate continuous improvement and adherence to best practices in child care.
We will establish a monitoring system to evaluate the effectiveness of these trainings and support mechanisms. Regular assessments will be conducted to ensure that the strategies are being employed correctly and to identify any additional areas requiring attention or improvement.
