	Could you please have them explain how the Behavioral specialist specifically support the direct care staff? The specialist is on hand seven days a week and provide back up to direct care staff and supervisors and develop individual plans for each child in care and do life skills with the children in care.
	How will staff communicate with each other in crisis situations when they dont have teams in front of them? Cellphone? Walkie talkies? Staff use cell phones, house phones and walkie talkies.
	Are they doing head counts during transitions and shift changes? Theres a head count at shift charge as part of the overall process of informing oncoming staff, they do head counts when they take the kids outside to play and on outings.
	Are they only going to maintain ratio? Or have extra staff for the children on special supervision? The behavioral specialist dont count in ratio but can support with direct care and theres a supervision on hand 10 hours each weekend and a night shift floating staff. 
	Are the therapists contracted out or work for TruLight GRO? If they work for the GRO how do they help staff? The therapists are contracted in that they bill through Medicaid and come on campus for therapy. Each child in cares case manager meets with the therapist quarterly and theres communication when behavioral circumstances arise.
	Please have them be specific on what they are doing daily in real time to ensure supervision not just ratio and not what they would like to do. The operation has changed their safety plans. There was a link on teams, which remains. Additionally, the operation posts the safety plans in extended reach and case managers go over safety plans in person with staff by the next shift after the plans creation and safety plans are updated and often extended. Safety plan for behaviors such as runaways and self harm are also consulted with the therapists and Trulight goes on the therapists recommendations. Direct care staff/supervisors and therapists are required to notify Sondra and Tiffany immediately when such an incident happens after hours. The operation doesnt want to take away outside privileges for children in care, since its often a coping mechanism which reduces runaways, so staff will follow children in care outside.



Email Received 7/5/23

Operation Plan for compliance is as follows: 

For Safety Plans;
	consult with therapist and get feedback.
	talk with Behavioral Specialist assigned.
	Staff with supervisor
If it is an emergency, staff with administrators first. We need to make sure each safety plan is specific to the child.
