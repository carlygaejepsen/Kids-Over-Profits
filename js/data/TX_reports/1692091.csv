Most importantly, any service plan information that is in need of a safety plan will be transferred to the lanyard and the staff member responsible for the supervision of the resident will know that information as it will be printed on the lanyard.  In response to the TA given, we will also be documenting/auditing verification that each staff member is following each childs supervision plan in part by assigning staff to children and their associated lanyards at the beginning of each shift and documenting the headcount at the end of each shift ensuring all children are accounted for each shift.

Our new lanyard system ensures that every staff member knows exactly which child they are responsible for as they will be literally wearing the name of the children they are supervising around their necks.  As the staff switch up supervision responsibilities, so will the lanyard travel.  For example, a staff member has John Does lanyard around their neck along with three other children they are supervising during school hours.  John Doe has an appointment at the dentist so the staff member transporting John Doe will not only take John Doe but also will wear his lanyard during the appointment, ensuring the lanyard passes along with the resident from staff member to staff member.
