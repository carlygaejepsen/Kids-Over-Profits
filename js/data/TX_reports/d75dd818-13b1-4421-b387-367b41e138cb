Shiloh submitted the background check requests for the four staff members to the CCL
CBCU on 01/11/22. All four employees were determined to be Eligible per the
background check results from CCL CBCU.
Shilohs new Human Resources Record Manager was confused about the two versions
of required background checks for TDHHS and Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).
A background check was submitted and received from ORR via the Texas Department
of Public Safety for each employee prior to hiring. Shiloh did not allow any employee to
begin working with clients without an eligible background check. Unfortunately, there
was confusion about submission for TDHHS CCL and ORR employees. The
misunderstanding was clarified and the process for background checks resumed the
correct procedure on 01/11/22."
