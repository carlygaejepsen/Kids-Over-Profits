SJRC Texas understands the importance of providing the necessary supervision levels to all youth in our care. SJRC Texas adheres to the DFPS Minimum Standards by providing appropriate ratio to the youth in our General Residential Operation. It can be difficult during a crisis, when youth are non-compliant, to decide if the priority should be to follow a group of a non-compliant youth out of a building or stay with the majority of the youth who are compliant. Crisis triaging is a primary function of the direct care staff, so SJRC Texas will continue to coach and train the staff on how to handle these difficult split-second decisions. "
