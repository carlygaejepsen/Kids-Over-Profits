(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan(s); and 

(2)	more than 12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.

As you know, the heightened monitoring plans for your operation included a specific planned end date at the original 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plans, your operation was unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring by the original planned end date necessitating previous extension.  

Furthermore, due to your recent citations issued on August 3, 2023, your operations planned end date must now be revised again, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended again. 

Further details of the failure of your operations administrator to ensure compliance include the following: 
The operation received a high weighted citation in a pattern/trend category on August 3,2023. Specifically, the operation was cited for 748.685(a)(4) Caregiver responsibility - being able to intervene when necessary to ensure child's safety.    The operation has until August 16, 2023, to meet compliance on.   
-	Operation failed to satisfy the conditions of the plan
-	Operation failed to demonstrate 6 months of successive compliance with the standard and contract requirements that led to heightened monitoring
-	Operation was unable to meet compliance with High weighted licensing citations 

Finding: 748.535(2)  The licensed administrator must ensure the operation complies with current heightened monitoring plans.
","An HM extension was approved effective 8/8/2023.  In conjunction with this extension, a new deadline was established by which all requirements must be completed by your GRO in order for the operation to be released from its HM plan and move to the Post-plan Monitoring Stage of HM.  Because the extended deadline is now effective, HHSC has determined that the operation is compliant with the requirements of 26 TAC 748.535(2).
