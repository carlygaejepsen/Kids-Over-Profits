Moving Forward

The Professional Level Service Provider/Case Manager/Licensed Child Care Administrator will ensure that each childs service plan is completely individualized and detailed to ensure that the childs needs are evaluated and met in all areas of service and need, including but not limited to signatures.

Failing to do so may result in staff being removed from their work schedule pending results from investigation and/or allowed to work in another area.
