As you know, the heightened monitoring plans for your operation included a specific Â“planned end dateÂ” at the 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of Â“post plan monitoringÂ”.  As a direct result of the administratorÂ’s failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plans, your operation is now unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring.  Furthermore, your operationÂ’s Â“planned end dateÂ” must now be revised, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended.

Further details of the failure of your operationÂ’s administrator to ensure compliance include the following: 
-	Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations, including having an open investigation(s).
