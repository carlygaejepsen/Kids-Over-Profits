We take such concerns very seriously and would like to clarify our position and the structured approach we take to ensure the well-being and safety of every youth in our care.
Divine Integrity Group Home is committed to providing a safe, nurturing, and structured environment where female youth can heal, grow, and thrive. Our program is designed to offer a world-class experience, equipping youth with essential life skills while promoting emotional and social development. Our caregivers are trained to provide compassionate guidance and support while maintaining a positive and structured living environment.
To clarify, Divine Integrity Group Home does not arbitrarily discharge youth from our program. However, youth who engage in behaviors that significantly disrupt the programs flow, including persistent disrespect toward caregivers and bullying of other residents, jeopardize their permanency. Our primary responsibility is to create a secure and supportive setting for all individuals in our care. When a youth's actions threaten the safety or well-being of others, we are obligated to address these concerns appropriately and in accordance with DFPS regulations and best practices.
We implement a tiered intervention approach, which includes behavioral redirection, counseling, and individualized support plans, before considering any changes to a youths placement. Discharge is considered only as a last resort and is done in collaboration with DFPS and all relevant stakeholders to ensure the youths needs are met in the most appropriate setting.
