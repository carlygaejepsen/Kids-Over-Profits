Positive reinforcement is the most effective form of molding a behavior, and will be used first and in-conjunction with all other forms of behavior intervention.
Specific interventions allowed are described below:
Ignoring:  paying no obvious attention to the youths negative behavior, in order to extinguish the behavior from lack of attention.
Calm discussion:  listening to the youth to see if you can determine the source of the difficulty and help solve the problem.
Warning:  informing the youth of the unwanted behavior and of the possible consequences if the behavior continues.
Activity restriction:  a youth may be restricted from a specific activity for a specific period of time depending on the severity of the misbehavior.  
Quiet time:  allowing the youth at the youths own initiative to enter and remain in a designated area for a brief period, in order to regain control.
Verbal warning:  a warning may be given to a youth without further disciplinary action and will include the offense, expected behavior and the understanding that repetition of this behavior will result in further disciplinary action.
Loss of Level(s):  A youth may lose a single or more levels, depending on whether the incident was a major or a minor rule violation or the chronic repetition of the misbehavior.
Room restriction:  a youth may be restricted to his room for a specific period of time, the length of which depends on the nature of the misbehavior and the circumstances.  A restriction may not exceed one minute per year of the childs chronological or developmental age.
