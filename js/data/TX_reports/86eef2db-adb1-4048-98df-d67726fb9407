All staff member(s) involved in this deficiency will also undergo mandatory retraining on RCSAs supervision policies. This is non-negotiable and must be completed within 14 days of assignment.

As a reminder, all caregivers are required to maintain line of sight supervision during any instance that child is on an elevated surface. These surfaces include but are not limited to changing tables, playground equipment, or any other surface that a fall could reasonably cause injury from that height. All staff members are also reminded to utilize proper safety straps while using changing tables or playground equipment. Failure to do so may result in progressive disciplinary action. 

Remember, staff members are encouraged to communicate with one another to ensure children are adequately supervised at all times. There may be instances in which a staff member is requested by their supervisor or colleague to complete an assignment or task that could result in a lapse in supervision. Should this occur, that staff member is encouraged to maintain supervision regardless of the request. No assignment within the facility is more important than ensuring the safety of our children. No supervisor or colleague should also make a request that could hinder the supervision of children knowingly. These instances serve to further exhibit the importance of effective communication when caring for our children. For any questions, please contact the treatment director or quality improvement specialist directly.

The compliance plan stated the following: the expectation is that all staff within Respite Care of San Antonio (RCSA) demonstrate competency, prudent judgment, and self-control in presence of children. This means maintaining a level of mindfulness when completing tasks that directly affect a child or their wellbeing. RCSA will continue its zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate physical direction and continue to self-report any instance that may violate this standard should it arise. RCSA will also continue to utilize present structures to re-emphasize the importance of prudent judgment and self-control when managing our vulnerable population. 

RCSA prides itself on our ability to foster positive changes in our youth while instilling the skills necessary for them to progress developmentally. To maintain regulatory compliance, as well as to provide the highest level of care possible, all staff members are trained in SAMAs de-escalation strategies before being alone with our children. Satori Alternatives to Managing Behavior (SAMA) is a state certified and approved curriculum that Respite Care trains in and utilizes. The curriculum includes communication, escorting, basic protection, intermediate protection, advanced protection, and containment. These principles call for the least restrictive action to be implemented as a first resort and that containment should be reserved unless absolutely necessary. During this training, and all subsequent follow up training, it is stressed that staff members must utilize appropriate redirection techniques when managing behaviors. Staff are instructed to utilize the least restrictive intervention necessary to gain the compliance of a child. Staff are also instructed that we are never to utilize physical redirection unless that physical redirection is necessary to maintaining the health or wellbeing of a child in our care. This will continue to be stressed to our personnel during regularly scheduled classes that are to occur within the first 90 days of employment, prior to that staff being counted in the caregiver/ child ratio, and every 6 months thereafter as a refresher course. 

Under the guidance of the Treatment Director, all staff within RCSA have also been trained in Working with Intellectual/ Developmental Disabilities as part of their initial preservice requirements. Within this training, the 4 key functions of behavior are referenced, as well as behavioral management techniques that can be completed proactively or retroactively to effectively manage a childs needs. This training consists of nonphysical redirection techniques that are specific to the corresponding function of behavior. This training will continue to be completed as a preservice requirement, but will also be made available upon request, or at the discretion of the treatment team should staff appear to require increased guidance.

The plan is as follows: It is the expectation that all staff within Respite Care of San Antonio (RCSA) demonstrate competency, prudent judgment, and self-control in presence of children. This means maintaining a level of mindfulness when completing tasks that directly affect a child or their wellbeing. It is always recommended that RCSA personnel utilize each other as a resource and request guidance whenever necessary to ensure appropriate actions are taken under potentially stressful scenarios. Any action that may feel questionable or potentially harmful to maintaining the health, safety, or wellbeing of a child must be immediately ceased until further guidance can be obtained via the Treatment Director, Quality Assurance Specialist, or designee. It is always recommended that actions outside of normal day to day tasks be consulted upon to limit potentially harmful interactions from taking place. These scenarios include but are not limited to:

	Room Checks
	Retrieval of Property 
	Reinforcement or Consequences Not Previously Discussed as a Treatment Team
	Alterations to Established Protocols
	Atypical Requests from the Youth
	Atypical Behaviors from the Youth
	Changes to the Bed Chart 
	The Administration of PRN or OTC Medications
	Psychiatric Hospitalizations
	Medical Hospitalizations 
	ETC  

It is also mandated that any potentially harmful or maladaptive behaviors completed by a resident be reported to the Treatment Director, Quality Assurance Specialist, or designee immediately. This is to begin planning behavioral modifications that meet our criteria for safety and effectiveness.

Caregivers are not permitted to independently manage any of the aforementioned scenarios unless previously instructed by the Treatment Director, Quality Assurance Specialist, or designee; or the scenario presents an active risk to the health, safety, or wellbeing of a resident. Only under those circumstances may a staff act without guidance. Should that occur, at the soonest possible moment, staff must notify the Treatment Director, Quality Assurance Specialist, or designee; and complete a detailed report of the scenario, actions taken, and outcomes in the form of an Incident Report.
