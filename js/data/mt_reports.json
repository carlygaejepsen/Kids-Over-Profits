Residents #1 and #2 eloped\n\nfrom the therapeutic group home between 11pm and 1am.\nResidents #1 and #2 were able to leave the therapeutic group\nhome while staff #1 was assigned to supervise the program\nclients and were only identified as missing when the program\nreceived a telephone call from the emergency personnel that\nresident #2 had been discovered by a person in the community\nunconscious on the sidewalk. Emergency personnel suspected\na possible drug overdose. During interviews conducted with\nthe residents #1, #2, and #3 informed this surveyor that when\ngetting up at night they frequently would see staff #1 sleeping\non shift. Residents #1 and #2 reported that they would only\nelope on Staff #1’s shift because they know she doesn’t check\non them and the other night watch on the weekend is always\nawake and checking on them, so they do not try during the\nweekends. Residents #1 and #2 also reported that they know\nthat Staff #1 is not checking on them because they have put\ntheir garbage cans against the door at night to see if it moves\nfrom staff checking on them throughout the night and stated it\nnever moves when staff #1 is on shift. Staff #1 is not providing\nsufficient nighttime supervision to meet the safety needs and\nsupervision of residents at the program.\nPROVIDERS PLAN OF CORRECTION:\n1) AWARE suspended staff #1 and followed AWARE’s\ndisciplinary process to remove this staff member from this\ncurrent position as an alone member during sleeping hours of\nresidents. Staff #1 has been reallocated to another position\nthat is monitored and shared with a colleague. All NW staff\nhave been retrained on documentation and logs will be\nreviewed by supervisor to look for any cloning of records.\nAWARE also installed new alarms on windows. There is also a\nvideo monitoring system in common areas. Routine NW checks\nby an outside supervisor will occur at random to check that\n\nNW is awake and performing their duties as designated. All\nlogs will be completed as shift is occurring. A NW team\nmeeting specific meeting and training will be completed and\nlogged in the staff meeting and supervision notes in addition\nto weekly staffing meeting per requirements. Staff are to\nnotify of any missing child upon identification of the absence.\nStaff have been trained that they are to visibly see the person\nin bed and if not they are to go into the room and physically\ncheck the child and remove any debris causing a monitoring\nissue. If the child is identified as missing they will follow\nprotocols of notifications to police, Centralized intake,\nguardians, and AWARE’s on call responding team. Child will be\nlooked for and returned to the facility for monitoring or seek\nmedical attention as needed.",

Guardians were also informed of room/unit\nchanges, including another unit change that occurred on\n12/23/21 to implement additional precautions. The Lead\nClinical Staff completed an internal investigation 11/15/21 and\nthe Clinical Director completed a second internal investigation\non 12/7/21 to ensure effective corrective actions and safety\nplans were immediately implemented. Law enforcement\narrived to interview the youth as well; they did not pursue\nanything further.\nA mandatory staff meeting occurred to review the Supervision\n\n\nPolicy and reiterate the importance of proper supervision. It\nwas also clarified that even when youth are in quarantine\nprotocol, they must still remain within eyesight of staff, even\nwhen staff go upstairs for things like dispensing medication.\nThey discussed alternative ways to enforce this, such as\nsending the upstairs staff downstairs to supervise the youth.\nStaff member Maggie Sheen has not worked in the Unit III\nbasement since the reported incident on 12/6/21. She also\nreceived a corrective action written warning (attached), in\nwhich the Human Resource Manager told her further policy\nviolations would result in termination.\nAnother corrective action for this unit will occur during the\nweek of January 3, 2022 when it moves from the two-level\nhome at 5351 King Ave to a one-level unit at 1111 Coburn.\nThe 4 youth bedrooms are set in optimal viewing areas for\nstaff to maintain close supervision.\nAt the current location (& at soon-to-be new location),\nProgram Managers and Lead Clinicals are continuing to float\namong the staff for oversight and to make sure proper\nsupervision is being implemented.\nPlan of Correction received and accepted on 12/27/2021."

        "Plan of Correction": "The majority of outlet covers on the unit were installed with\nmetal “hospital grade” commercial covers (including light,\noutlet, and blank types). Additionally, “snake eye” tamperresistant screws were utilized.\nWhat was learned during these incidents was that covers that\nonly utilize one shallow screw do not provide sufficient\nresistance to a determined individual seeking to remove them.\nFollowing the first incident (Resident #3, 6-9), maintenance\nattempted to caulk the perimeter of the cover to provide\nadditional support. It was discovered after the second incident\n(Resident #3, 6-17) that this fix could be circumvented by using\na fingernail to disrupt the caulk.\nThe final solution that was identified and implemented\nincluded:\n•\nRemoval of electrical outlet covers in bedrooms,\nreplaced with a blank that includes two deeper “snake eye”\ntype tamper-resistant screws\n\n•\nInstallation, behind the covers (all types), of a strong\nbonding adhesive\n•\nDeepest tamper-resistant set screw possible for light\nswitches\nFurther physical-plant modifications included:\n•\nRearranging bedroom furniture to remove the risk of a\nyouth barricading between the fixtures and the door, except in\nbedrooms 3, 4 where rearrangement is not possible. (Staff will\nensure that higher-risk youth are not placed in these\nbedrooms)\n•\nAdditionally, for rooms 3, 4 a “barn door” type door is\nbeing evaluated\nAll the above work, aside from “barn door” installation was\ncompleted by 7/23.
