    "narrative": "On January 11, 2024, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint alleging that minor sustained an unexplained fracture(s) while in care. During the investigation, there was no corroborating evidence to support the above allegation. Although the Department received information that the client sustained unexplained fractures while in care. The Investigator received inconsistent information that would indicate that the fractures of C1 were a result from abuse or neglect in care. Confidential interviews reported that the fractures observed on C1 can be a result from an existing medical condition and the application of a medical device used to meet C1's medical needs in care. Investigator Santana reviewed medical records and exams and the information was inconsistent in supporting abuse or neglect in care. Other confidential interviews reported that a combination of therapeutic regimens and the application of a medical device in care may or may not have contributed to the fractures to C1. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation and due to age and limit verbal communication C1 could not comment on whether the fractures were a result of abuse, neglect or if the allegation is untrue. Based on confidential interviews the allegation that minor sustained an unexplained fracture(s) while in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Licensee.",

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the following issues and concerns with the Licensee for CARE SFH regarding Title Continuing Care Requirements Section 80010(a) Limitations on Capacity and Ambulatory Status and Health and Safety Code (HSC) Section 1522(c)(1) Administration. On 8/26/ Community Care Licensing (CCL) conducted an unannounced random annual inspection and cited the SFH for allowing a 25 year old client to live at the facility. Upon file review CCL determined that all clients in placement were over the age of 18 years. Licensee reported that they have had multiple plans in the past regarding oldest client because they have been in placement since age of 10 years. Primary original plan was to change the home to an Adult Residential Facility to accommodate the client's needs. The clients have been in placement and the Licensee stated, \"it's their community\". However, Licensee has now decided against this plan for the SFH. The plan discussed at today's meeting includes another property owned by the Licensee. The additional property will be converted into an Adult Residential Facility. LPM Ortiz discussed the importance of submitting an application as soon as possible to initiate the licensing process. Continued on page LPM Ortiz also stated that they would communicate with the application unit, the urgency of the current situation of getting the SFH into compliance. The Adult Senior Care Unit will assist with contacting the Application Unit to expedite the process and communicate with Regional Center regarding the vendorization process. All clients over the age of 22 will be moved to new Adult Residential Facility once it is licensed and vendorized, and Licensee will submit new application and update the program statement to included clients ages 18 years of age through 22 years old to allow clients to remain in care up until their 23rd birthday. On 9/11/24 the following plan was developed: \u00b7 Licensee will submit Adult Residential Facility application no later than 9/27/24. If they need additional time, they will contact LPA Munoz via email to request the additional time needed to submit application. \u00b7 Home identified for Adult Residential Facility currently has a tenant living in it. They need to move out (family friend in the home) prior to Prelicensing. \u00b7 AR Certificate has been completed for new home administrator. \u00b7 Program Statement will be completed within the next two weeks. \u00b7 LPA Munoz will communicate will Licensee weekly. The plan of correction is due to CCL by 9/27/24. If more time is needed to submit the plan of action or there are any questions, please contact LPA Guadalupe Munoz at guadalupe.munoz@dss.ca.gov or (949) 701-3475. A copy of this report was reviewed and provided to Licensee. The signed report will be placed in the facility file.",

There were POCs that were reissued on 09/17/24, that were originally cited on 04/19/24. The due date for all POC's was 09/20/24. A request for an extension of the POC due date was requested by the Licensee on 09/23/24. The extension was granted and the POC due date was extended to 09/27/24. On 09/27/24 at 8:22pm, Licensee sent Community Care Licensing emails containing documents, photos, and videos. On 10/02/24, LPA Pierotti reviewed the documents, photos and videos submitted by the Licensee for the POCs. LPA Pierotti found the submitted files to not contain the POCs that were developed and agreed upon during the meeting on 09/17/24. On 10/03/24 at 1:32pm, LPA Pierotti called Licensee regarding the submitted documents and explained what the department was looking for in a POC. LPA Pierotti explained the department wanted Licensee to submit a written plan stating that in the future the Licensee will take these steps to prevent the cited deficiency from occurring again. LPA Pierotti gave Licensee an additional extension to submit the POCs by 10/7/24. On 10/07/24 at 6:57pm, LPA Pierotti received documents from the Licensee. LPA Pierotti reviewed the documents on 10/08/24 and found the submitted documents contained POCs from the reissued citations however, POCs from the reissuing were not submitted. LPA Pierotti also found the POCs that were developed and agreed upon during the meeting on 09/17/24 were not submitted. On 10/16/24, during the visit Licensee signed Plans of Correction for the 13 remaining POCs. Licensee agrees to follow the agreed upon POCs and to follow Community Care Licensing Regulations to remain in compliance with the Department. Although Civil Penalties will be assessed, they were discussed during this visit and LPAs will discuss with the department regarding the amount. LPAs will have a follow up conversation with Ms. Cooper on 10/17/2 at which time the appropriate forms will be submitted for review and signature. Currently there is an appeal date which has been extended to 10/18/24. The Licensee will be submitting evidence and documents to support their appeal for the citations.

During the interview conducted with Adult #1, it was reported that the allegation was false. Adult #1 confirms that C1 is only prescribed one medication. Adult #1 confirms that medication is administered to C1 as follows: \u00bd pill at 6:00am and 1 \u00bd pill at 8:00pm every day by crushing the pill and placing it in water. Adult #1 watches to ensure C1 drinks the water containing the medication. LPA confirms the instructions on the bottle of medicine and by reviewing the daily entries on the medication log kept by Adult #1. Reporting party (RP) states Adult #2 confirms FP expressed medication was placed in a \"shake\" for C1 but when later asked by RP, Adult #1 denied this was true. LPA was unable to confirm whether C1's medication was placed in the shake on the day of the incident. Witness #1 confirms that the school does not administer or provide medication to C1. Collateral witness confirms that C1 is prescribed and taking one medication twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Based on the interviews conducted, the information gathered did not produce corroborating evidence to support the above said allegations. Due to inconsistent statements and documentary evidence obtained LPA Edison was not able to determine if the above said allegations occurred, therefore the allegations were determined to be unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred. No deficiencies were observed or cited at the time of this investigation. Exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report will be mailed to the Licensee.",

The purpose of this visit was to deliver the findings for the above complaint allegations. During the course of investigating the allegations for foster child's hygiene needs are not being met while in care and foster parent is not providing medication to foster child., LPA Edison conducted interviews with Adult #1 and other collateral contacts. During the interviews conducted with Adult #1, it was reported that the allegations were false. Adult #1 confirms that she sends C1 to school each day with clean clothes on as well as two sets of clean clothes and extra \"diapers\" in his backpack in case he needs to be changed at school. On the day licensee was interviewed, LPA conducted an inspection of C1's backpack and confirms extra unused diapers and two sets of clean clothes. LPA also noted that C1 had a small food stain on the front of his shirt, however, the rest of his clothing appeared clean. Adult #1 states that C1 has plenty of clothes, shoes, diapers, and cleaning wipes. Collateral witnesses state C1 often comes to school filthy and \"reeks of urine\". Adult #1 denies this allegation and states C1 takes a bath at 6:00am, 4:00pm, and 8:00pm daily. On this day, LPA observed C1 pulling Adult #1 towards the bathroom to run his bath. LPA was not able to make contact with collateral Witness #3, who was responsible for transporting C1 to school every morning up until September 8, 2021, to confirm the condition of C1's clothing and hygiene upon arrival every morning before school. LPA made several telephone calls and left messages with Witness #3's supervisor, however, the witness did not return phone calls to LPA. Other collateral witnesses state asking Adult #1 to pick up C1 from school and take him home due to him having soiled his clothes with urine and feces. Adult #1 refused to take C1 home but came to the school and cleaned C1 in the bathroom. C1 and C2 are both non-verbal, therefore LPA was unable to verbally interview them. LPA observed children to be clean. LPA was able to inspect each child's bedroom. LPA observed C1 and C2 have more than enough clothes and shoes, all in good repair, some still brand new to allow for multiple changes of clothing if needed daily. LPA also observed C1 having a big supply of \"diapers' and cleaning wipes in his bedroom. Collateral witnesses confirm C1 and C2 are both clean and well-groomed children upon recent visits to the home. CSW #1 was interviewed and confirms issuance of a clothing allowance and observation of clothes purchased for C1 with this allowance upon a visit to the home. CSW #1 confirms no concerns about C1's placement or care in the home. Based on the interviews conducted, the information gathered did not produce corroborating evidence to support the above said allegations. Due to inconsistent statements and documentary evidence obtained LPA Edison was not able to determine if the above said allegations occurred, therefore the allegations were determined to be unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred.

Bedroom 1 has 2 doors. 1 that leads to the Garden and the other that leads into the home. Bedroom 1 provides sufficient privacy to a client in care. Once the room is fully converted, Administrant will confirm the changes with LPA. LPA will then update the Facility Program Statement with the new LIC 999.

Facility personnel provided inconsistent statements to the Department, placement agency social workers and law enforcement regarding the incident. Initially, the facility reported a plastic highchair accidentally fell over and struck the foster child's (FC1) face on or about 9/02/24, 7: PM, causing no injury. The following morning, daycare staff observed FC1 with an abrasion on the left eye and nose, which later worsened to a bruising with swelling. Daycare staff requested the licensee pick up FC1 and suggested medical follow up. On 9/06/24, a forensic medical exam was conducted on FC1. The exam findings concluded FC1 sustained a nose fracture, facial contusion injuries and swelling of the facial area. The extent of the injuries was inconsistent with the explanation provided by licensee. In addition, the facility failed to seek timely medical attention for the child until they were advised to do so by daycare staff. On 9/3/24, FC1 was treated by a doctor for facial injuries. The doctor observed the child with bruising to his nose, cheek and eye areas and recommended completing x-rays to assess for broken bones or other damage. The doctor reviewed the child's record on 9/27/24 and x-ray results were not on file, indicating it was not completed. Also, the doctor who conducted the forensic exam on 9/6/24 noted the delay in seeking medical care for the child is consistent with neglect. Furthermore, the facility failed to follow reporting requirements. Until advised by the Department on 9/11/24, the facility failed to report the extent of the child's injuries as observed by daycare staff on 9/3/24 and the child's medical visit. Based on information gathered from interviews conducted and record review the allegations are substantiated. The facility is cited for violation of California Code of Regulation, Title Div. 6 regulation 83072(d)(1) Personal Rights, regulation 80061(b)(1)(D) Reporting Requirements and regulation 83075(b) Health Related Services.

    "narrative": "During the investigation, Licensee reported that she was away from home for one night to celebrate her anniversary. In the morning, she contacted her father and she learned that FC1 was fussy and didn't sleep the night before. Therefore, she asked to do a facetime video and she felt that FC1 had an unusual behavior. Licensee added that she rushed back home, and she realized that FC1 medication was not given as prescribed. Licensee's father administered 4 mg of Baclofen instead of 0.4 mg prescribed dosage of Baclofen. Licensee stated that she immediately called 911 and the FC1 was taken to the hospital. A confidential witness reiterated the medication error and added FC1 receiving the wrong dosage wasn't intentional or causing harm to FC1. Additionally, other interviews reported FC1's placement at the SFH was appropriate and FC1 was under a good care. Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined the allegation that an adult in the home did not dispense FC1's medication as prescribed is substantiated. The SFH is being cited for violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 4, Regulation 83075(d)(4): Health Related Services. This poses an immediate Health, Safety, or Personal Rights Risk to children in care. Exit interview conducted. Copies of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights provided to licensee. During the investigation, Licensee disclosed that the adult in home that cared for FC1 was her father who has been involved in the care and supervision of the children for a longtime. Licensee denied that her father was not trained to provide care for the children. Licensee stated that she was a registered nurse and provided ongoing trainings with her father. Licensee added that she felt comfortable to leave the children with her father and she believed her father made an error in reading the prescription dosage wrong. A confidential witness stated several medication trainings were covered; however, they didn't believe documentation was needed to prove that the trainings have occurred. CPS Investigator indicated that there was no record of medication training, however, the county has already provided a medication administration training in response to the medication error. LPA was unable to obtain any written documentation to show that the father received medication training. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the allegation that an adult in the home was not trained to provide care to child with special health care needs The Department's finding is that this allegation is unsubstantiated.

CCL received an allegation that alleged a lack of supervision resulted in a missing child (FC3). It was reported that FC3 had multiple unauthorized absences from the SFH. Special Incident Reports submitted to the Department indicated that FC3 left the SFH without permission and had a history of similar behavior in other facilities. However, confidential statements provided to the Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) denied inadequate supervision in the home and reported that FC3 would leave late at night or after the scheduled bedtime. Additionally, it was noted that, due to FC3's behavior, supervision during evening hours was increased. Confidential interviews also reported that the licensee took the necessary precautions to ensure FC3's safety while in care. Alarms were installed on the windows and doors, which would alert the licensee to any attempts by FC3 to leave the facility. Further, there were no concerns regarding FC3's continued placement in the SFH, as it was reported that FC3's authorized representative is aware of the behavior and a safety plan will be created specifically to address FC3's tendency to leave the home without permission. CCL also received allegations that the licensee did not provide adequate meals to children (FC1-FC4), licensee did not ensure children had clean clothing, and licensee did not ensure hygiene needs of children were met. Documentation reported that multiple unannounced visits were conducted at the SFH, and the home was observed to have adequate food and the foster children (FC1-FC4) were reported to have sufficient clean, and appropriate clothing. Hygiene products were also observed in the home, and it was reported the children bathed daily. Further, documentation of other confidential interviews consistently reported that the needs of the foster children (FC1-FC4) were being met.

LPA B, Aborchie conducted health and safety inspection with no immediate concerns and conducted interviews with licensee (LS) and staff #1 (S1). In addition, LPA M. Chavez conducted collateral interviews with FC1, FC2, and County Social Workers. Regarding the above allegation that licensee and an adult in the home handled foster child in a rough manner, it was specifically reported that LS grabbed FC1 by the wrists and pulled FC1 into the house and grabbed FC1 by the feet and dragged FC1 across the floor. During investigation, a confidential witness stated that LS was dragging FC1 inside the SFH and even recorded the incident occurring. Another confidential interview disclosed that they received a blurry image of what appeared to be FC1 being dragged down the hallway by an adult man. However, other interviews denied handling any foster children in a rough manner. LPA's received inconsistent information. Regarding the above allegation that licensee yelled at foster children, a confidential interview disclosed that LS does not yell at foster children in home however, when necessary, LS will use a higher voice level to redirect foster child's behaviors. Another confidential interview disclosed that LS would yell but not a lot. LPA received a conflicting information. In regard to licensee did not prevent foster child from being harmed by another child and did not provide a safe and comfortable environment for foster children allegations, a confidential interview disclosed that a child at the SFH would hit, curse, and push FC1 and LS could not control the child nor discipline the child. In addition, confidential interviews disclosed that there was an incident where the child was throwing rocks at FC1 and FC2 and LS could not get the incident under control ultimately leading to calling the police for help. As a result, FC1 did not feel that the SFH was a safe and comfortable environment. Furthermore, confidential interview disclosed that when living at SFH FC1 always felt nervous and had anxiety and living there felt like a jail. Another confidential interview disclosed that staff always ensured supervision and at no time has a child hit another child. Regarding the above allegations adult in the home spoke inappropriately to and threatened foster child. It was specifically reported that an adult male threatened FC1 that he would pour ice cubes down FC1's shirt after telling FC1 no to going outside and that an adult female told FC1 to shut up after throwing FC1 on to a bed. It was also specifically reported that an adult female told FC2 \"your mother is a bad mother. She's not worried about you.\" A confidential interview disclosed that no adult in the SFH has ever threatened foster children and it was specifically stated that FC2 constantly called biological mother to report dislikes in the home and would sometimes make-up stories. Another confidential interview disclosed that adults in the home told FC2 that FC2's biological mother didn't care about FC1 and FC2 because she isn't doing her classes. In addition, confidential interview disclosed that an adult male tried to trip FC2 then pulled down FC'1 shirt to pour ice onto FC1's body. Regarding the allegation that resource parent did not administer foster child's medication in a timely manner. A confidential interview disclosed that when FC2 was sick FC2 did not receive medicine. Another confidential interview disclosed that both FC1 and FC2 do not have any doctor prescribed medication but when FC2 had a cough or upset stomach, FC2 was given an over-the-counter remedy. Another confidential interview disclosed that FC2's biological mother prescribed FC2 an over-the-counter medication for a cough. In addition, confidential interview stated that when FC2 was on the phone with bio-logical mother the mother heard FC2 cough and then stated that FC2 coughed because FC2 was not being given the over-the-counter medication. LPA received a conflicting information. Based on interview and record review, the allegations that licensee and an adult in the home handled foster child in a rough manner; licensee yelled at foster children; licensee did not prevent foster child from being harmed by another child; licensee did not provide a safe and comfortable environment for foster children; Adult in the home spoke threatened and inappropriately to foster child; and licensee did not administer foster child's medication in a timely manner may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations, therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

During a confidential interview it was stated that LS would make FC1 and FC2 go to bed at 5:00PM while the sun was still up because LS is tired. Another confidential interview stated that FC1 and FC2 are sent to their room after dinner so that LS can sweep and mop the downstairs area after dinner. Then, FC1 and FC2 turn in their tablets at 8:00PM so they can go to bed at 9:00PM. In regard to the allegation that licensee denied the minors access to food, a confidential interview stated that FC1 and FC2 have freedom to get snacks in between meals and that LS prepares meals daily. Another confidential interview stated that LS provides food, and it is fine. LPA didn't receive any additional information. Regarding the allegation that licensee demonstrated inappropriate form of discipline, it was specifically reported that when FC1 misbehaved, the one-on-one staff would throw FC1 over his shoulder. A confidential interview disclosed that there was a time FC1 went outside without permission, therefore, FC1 was dragged back inside by the wrists by LS. Confidential interview also disclosed that another time when FC1 was in trouble an adult picked FC1 up and threw FC1 into the bedroom. Another confidential interview stated that the LS disciplines FC1 and FC2 by taking away their tablet privileges or time-out in their bedrooms. In regard to the allegation that licensee allowed a minor to provide care and supervision to other minors in care, it was specifically reported that there is a fifteen-year-old foster child in the SFH that at times has supervised FC1 and FC2. During a confidential interview, it was disclosed that when LS went to the store there were no adults in the home and that a fifteen-year-old watched FC1 and FC2 while LS was at the store. Another confidential interview disclosed that LS's daughter who is in college comes home on the weekends and supervises FC1 and FC2 and has fingerprint clearance. Based on interview and record review, the allegations that LS forced the minors to sleep; LS denied the minors access to food; LS demonstrated inappropriate form of discipline; LS allowed a minor to provide care and supervision to other minors in care may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations, therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.
