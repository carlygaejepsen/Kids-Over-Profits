The purpose of the inspection was to deliver the findings for the above complaint allegations. During the investigation, LPA interviewed staff and clients which revealed that staff left youth unsupervised and an uncleared adult was supervising youths. On April 4, 2020, a client (see 811 for confidential names) was taken to the hospital for an assessment. While at the hospital, the staff (S1) accompanying the client became concerned of a potential COVID-19 exposure. As a result of this concern, S1 left the client unsupervised at the hospital and contacted the facility for someone to replace her. According to interviews, there was only one staff on shift back at the house. Due to the facility being short staffed, S2 left the home to cover S1 but asked her boyfriend to cover S2's shift at the house. S2's boyfriend did not have a background check record clearance or exemption with the Department on this date but was approved to cover the shift by the Administrator under the presumption of the statewide waivers due to COVID-19. S2's boyfriend stayed with residents alone for a few hours until S2 returned with the client. Although the Department did issue statewide waivers for background check requirements due to COVID-19 (PIN 20-04), Administrator did not follow the terms and conditions set forth in PINs 20-04 and 20-09. The boyfriend's presence at the facility on April 4, 2020 was not approved by the Department because there no written waiver submitted as required by PINs 20-04 and 20-09. Based on the information obtained, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. California Code of Regulations are being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.

Additionally, the NSP modifications did not include the facility's recommendation regarding the feasibility of the child's return to a less restrictive family-like setting; the need for modification in services and the progress of the child toward a transfer goal. All the NSP reviewed by LPA contained the same information with no changes in the language.

    "narrative": "On this date, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Cynthia Galindo conducted an unannounced Case Management visit, via telephone as a result of Covid-19 related restrictions and spoke with Administrator Shannon Blanchard. The purpose of the phone call was to discuss a few concerns on the facility. LPA discussed the following with Administrator: Runaway Plan, Emergency Intervention Plan (EIP), staff training, admission determination and procedures, reporting requirements and supervision concerns. LPA conducted a thorough review of the facility's staff training records, incident reports and the facility's plan of operation and program statement as well as interviewed staff and Administrator. Based on record review, staff training records do not include training received on physical and psychosocial needs of children, including behavior management, de-escalation techniques and trauma-informed crisis management planning as required by regulation 87065.1 (c)(3)(X). Training records do not demonstrate how much time is spent on this required topic. According to training records, staff receive ongoing training from Managing Aggressive Behavior (MAB) however the Program Statement states training is to be provided by Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI). The MAB training is not in compliance with the regulations as it was not approved by the Department prior to implementation as required by regulation 87095.22(c). next page... Additionally, facility is not following the Plan of Operation and Program Statement in the following sections as required by regulation 87022(f): Staff training plan- facility does not provide some of the training listed in Section D, page 4-12. Admission process and procedures- facility is not completing pre-screening triage and assessments to determine the appropriateness of placement as stated in Section F, page 2. EIP- facility does not utilize manual restraints as an emergency intervention when a resident is in imminent danger of self-harm or harm to others in the home as stated in the Program Statement Section 22, page 6. After a review of the facility's Law Enforcement contact reports and service calls from the local police department, it was revealed the facility is under reporting incidents and late reporting to the Department as required by regulation 87061(k)(1). Late reporting has been addressed with facility on several occasions. LPA discussed with Administrator concerns over staff's supervision on youth due to a few incidents that occurred in the home. An incident report emailed to the Department where staff provided youth with a cleaning product to complete chores. Staff did not supervise youth who later drank some of the disinfectant spray in attempt to self-harm. Youth was taken to the ER for ingestion of a toxin. On another occasion, a youth obtained access to a facility phone in the middle of the night and made unapproved and unsupervised phone calls. Based on incident reports and interviews, staff did not supervise youth on these occasions as part of their duties and required by regulation 87065.2(b)(1). The facility is being cited for the deficiencies listed above. The plan of correction discussed with Administrator will also include a submission of an updated Plan of Operation and Program Statement to the Department for approval. A copy of this report and appeal rights were sent via email to Administrator for signature.",

According to interviews and records, minors refused to attend school on several occasions. It is unclear if the enrollment process was delayed by the STRTP or the county but ultimately, clients were enrolled in school. As far as mental health needs, the STRTP was recently approved for in-home mental heatlh services but is contracted with the county to provide mental health services.

Interviews confirm that staff was aware that the blade was missing but yet no attempts were made to locate the blade.

Licensee said the NSP will be updated to include detail information about the youth's progress and behaviors and any restrictions. LPA reminded licensee that phone restrictions and safety plans need to be included in the NSP and discussed with the placement agency and youth. Licensee stated the facility has activities for the youth but will now have a more structured calendar. Licensee said there is a curfew for phone use but has difficulty enforcing it because the youth are defiant. LPA advised licensee to communicate with placement agency and inform of house rules. As far as the visits, licensee stated visits are coordinated and approved with the placement agency. In some cases, the county will allow visits as long as they are supervised. Licensee stated visitation information is listed on the youth's NSP. Lastly, licensee stated there will be a Board meeting in early October and will provide the minutes when available.

Confidential interviews confirm that staff gave youth the medication she arrived with and was provided by the county social worker. Youth was placed in the home on August 17, 2022 and was discharged from the home on September 13, 2022. The facility received a copy the JV223 that was granted on July 19, 2022 after youth was placed in the home. A copy of the JV223 was obtained from the facility but only consisted of two pages with no list of the medication prescribed. Medication records are consistent with the medication the youth received during her stay at the home. However, the youth's Needs and Service Plan for August lists a different set of medication which does not match the medication records. According to the JV220 an JV220 attachment provided by the CSW, the medication listed on the NSP was the correct medication that was prescribed and should have been given to the youth. The facility staff did not confirm with the county social worker the medication the youth was to take according to the JV223 that was granted on July 2022.

    "narrative": "One client who was allegedly hit and yelled at moved to a lockdown facility and LPA was not granted permission by client's guardian to conduct an interview. LPA attempted to interview additional clients who were allegedly yelled at and threatened but attempts were unsuccessful. LPA's calls to the guardian of one client were not returned while another client is AWOL and whereabouts are unknown. One client interviewed refused to address the allegations but stated that client had no issues with staff and other clients during placement, and that there was no issue with food. Staff denied hitting and yelling at clients. Staff reported that clients were questioned by law enforcement during AWOL and then brought back to the facility by staff. Clients were upset and threatened to call licensing. Staff reported that one client made the call. Staff stated they were redirecting clients prior to AWOL but clients were non complaint. Another staff denied yelling and making threats towards clients. Staff reported engaging positively with clients and redirects clients when they exhibit negative behavior. Statements obtained from other clients interviewed did not support the allegations. Clients reported not being aware of the allegations and claimed no maltreatment by staff and no issues with food. LPA observed adequate perishable and non-perishable food supply during the unannounced inspection. Photos were taken by LPA for proof of facility meeting regulatory requirements. Staff informed LPA that meals are prepared based on the menu and that there are options available to clients who refuse any meal served. Clients are encouraged to participate in menu preparation. Staff follow the posted menu but are open to accommodating requests during meal preparation, with concurrence from all clients. LPA did not find evidence to support the allegations in interviews with other parties and during the records review. Based on information gathered, although the allegations may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations was not met, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form and Appeal Rights were emailed to the facility representative. LPA requested for the licensing report to be reviewed, signed and emailed back to LPA. There was no deficiency citation issued.",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that at least one staff member (S1; See LIC Confidential Names Form) at the facility failed to meet the needs of one client (C1) in care. More specifically, it was alleged that the staff member failed to take C1's comments seriously during an incident in which they were in a mental crisis. No injuries were sustained although C1 was taken to the hospital as a precaution. In interviews conducted with clients in the home, the clients all stated that they felt safe in the home and felt that the staff were able to meet their needs. The clients all denied feeling dismissed by the staff members in the facility and any time issues were brought up were addressed in a timely manner. In an interview conducted with C1, C1 stated that S1 was their favorite staff member in the facility and denied ever feeling dismissed by S1. S1 was always helpful and took their comments seriously. In interviews conducted with staff, the above comments were corroborated. S1 stated that on the date of the incident, they stayed with C1 the whole time that they were in a state of crisis and played games with them to try and redirect them per their individualized safety plan. S1 denied being dismissive of C1's feelings and stated that the facility had procedures in place to try and redirect clients in crisis prior to calling emergency services. An interview conducted with the facility social worker confirmed these statements. The social worker stated that they had never seen or heard of any staff members in the home being dismissive of clients and they had no concerns about it. Comments made by clients during times of crisis were always taken seriously. A review of C1's Needs and Services Plan and Admissions Agreement confirmed that C1 was known to have episodes of mental crisis and that attempts to redirect them prior to calling emergency services was standard. Based on interviews, redirection procedures for C1 involved constant supervision, board games, car rides, and more. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the above allegation occurred. Although the allegation may have happened or may be valid, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegations are deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED. An exit interview was conducted and a signed copy of this report, along with the Licensee's Appeal Rights (LIC 9058 01/16) was provided to the Licensee.",

Staff (S1, S2, S3) denied the alleged allegations further indicating that all staff members are trauma-informed and understand the importance for each client to complete their individualized program. Staff further indicated that they have not heard nor have clients reported to them any incidents regarding staff using inappropriate language. All staff members denied encouraging anyone to fight, however, further disclosed that an incident occurred involving two clients (C1, C5) who were involved in a physical altercation outside of the facility. S1 further indicated that they were transporting C1 in the vehicle and received a call from another staff member (S2) informing them that C5 had just gone AWOL. S1 indicated that on the way back to the facility they observed C5 less than a block away from the facility, so they (S1) stopped to verbally redirect C5, and in doing so, C1 jumped out of the vehicle and started an altercation with C5. S1 indicated that she attempted to verbally redirect the clients but was not having any luck, so S1 called another staff member (S2) who assisted in separating the clients and taking them back to the facility without any further disruption. An incident report was completed, and all supporting agencies were notified in a timely manner. Information obtained from the above clients denied the alleged allegations further indicating the clients are the ones who threaten and use foul language toward staff when upset. Clients indicated that the staff does a good job of avoiding shouting matches and de-escalating situations that may arise in the facility between clients. Clients further stated that they feel safe and supported by the staff members at the facility. Clients denied that staff encourage them to fight each other. C1 further disclosed that she did get into an altercation outside the facility with a former client (C5). C1 indicated that they were being transported by S1 back to the facility and they had stopped to pick up C5 who had just gone AWOL. C1 stated that she got out of the car and started a verbal altercation with C5 which turned physical and was separated by S1 and S2. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Facility Administrator. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time.

(Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated February 10, 2023). It was alleged that the facility staff handled a client (C4) in a rough manner while trying to redirect them resulting in staff pushing the client into a wall and hitting said client with an object. Information obtained from staff members (S1, S2, S3) denied the alleged allegations further indicating that all staff members are trauma informed and understand the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with all clients and supporting them in successfully completing their individual programs. Facility staff further indicated that the facility is a hands-off facility and will only place hands on a client to prevent self-harm or bodily harm to others. Staff further disclosed that an incident involving (S3) and C4 occurred on 9/23/22 where (C4) had taken the cell phone into their room knowing that their CSW had informed staff that (C4) was not allowed to use their cellphone unless being supervised by a staff member. S4 indicated that supervision was required due to (C4) sending and receiving inappropriate messages from an unknown male. S3 indicated that when they attempted to retrieve the cell phone C4 ran into the room and began punching a hole in the wall, S4 attempted to verbally redirect and de-escalate the situation from the bedroom doorway when C4 ran and nudged S3 out of the way. S3 further disclosed that after two minutes of using verbal redirection C4 calmed down and proceeded to the living room where staff gave C4's phone back without further incident. Staff indicated that the incident was documented and sent to the appropriate agencies. Information obtained from CSW indicated that they were aware of the incident and when they spoke with C4, they didn't disclose any information indicating that everything was good and that they felt safe.

The Ref. #1 (see Confidential Names, LIC Ref. #1 dated February 15, 2023) was placed at the facility on 6/30/22. CCL received Special Incident Report (SIR) dated 7/1/22 stating Ref. #1 attempted to AWOL on 7/1/22 at 5: PM and brought back to the facility by Law Enforcement (LE) on 7/2/22 at 12: AM. Ref. #1 became agitated and walked out of the facility stating they were leaving the facility. Ref. #1 picked up rocks from the flower bed and began throwing rocks at staff and facility's vehicles breaking windows. LE was called and when the Officer arrived, the Officer transported the Ref. #1 to Mark K Shell for 5150 hold. At 6: AM, the Officer called and informed a staff that Ref. #1 made threats to others in the facility so the LE Officer recommended that Ref. #1 not return to the facility. The facility received a call from the hospital requesting to pick Ref. #1 up as they will be discharged. The facility did not pick Ref. #1 up from the hospital because the Ref. #1's bed was closed. The facility contacted the placement county, Fresno Social Worker, regards to discharge of the client; due to immediate danger to staff and clients in the facility, the Ref. #1's bed was closed. The Ref. #1 was placed in the facility without the medication. The facility was informed the Ref. #1's medication will be brought to the facility next day, but the medication never came. Ref. #1's CSW stated that the emergency refill was requested. Staff stated the incidents are reported to appropriate agencies and CCL. Clients interviewed stated incidents are reported to their CSWs as they knew of the incidents. Based on the information gathered, although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There were no deficiencies cited during this inspection. An exit interview was conducted.

During the inspection LPA Larios met with Administrator, Raeanna Howard. Information obtained from record review and interviews conducted revealed that on the afternoon of 1/5/25 incidents occurred at the facility requiring staff to restrain a client multiple times over a three-hour period. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted indicate that during this time a staff (S1) (See Confidential Names form LIC811 dated 6/9/25) obtained a water hose and sprayed a client (C1) with water due to the client's confrontational behavior. In addition, multiple witnesses reported observing S1 exchange profanities with C1 while addressing the behavior. A review of the incident report generated by the facility revealed the absence of information required by the Department including a description of the restraints used. The facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards STRTP 87072(c)(16) Personal Rights due to the client being sprayed with water and 87061(i)(7)(C) Reporting Requirements due to the absence of required information in the incident report. Refer to LIC809D for deficiency. A copy of this report, LIC811, LIC809D and appeals rights were provided to the above-mentioned facility representative.",

Staff stated that when clients are transported, there are at least two staff in the car. On the day of incident, there were staff with two clients in transit. Client 1 (C1) became upset when the staff did not open the van window enough to stick their head out the window. C1 then removed their seat belt off and refused to put it back on. C1 then stood up and tried to reach for steering wheel. A staff intervened and moved to the back seat of the van and staff provided multiple redirections. C1 continued to stand up inside the van trying to reach for the steering wheel. Staff pulled over on the side of the road and that is when C1 climbed into the front seat and left the van. C1 ran into the middle of the road and staff followed and provided redirections. However, C1 refused and sat in the middle of the street and refused to get up. Law enforcement was contacted and C1 was transported to the hospital. The LPA was unable to obtain any statements from clients as they declined to be interviewed. The statements obtained from the confidential interviews did not provide sufficient information to corroborate the allegation.

Staff stated that they conducted their room checks as per protocol, and that the door to the minors' rooms are usually ajar unless someone is changing in the room, allowing for extra visibility. Staff denied seeing any inappropriate activity being done by clients. Staff stated that they could not control what happened while minors were on unauthorized leave away from the facility, but that they did caution all minors against leaving for that same reason. Staff stated that redirection is used when minors attempt to leave unauthorized, but that they cannot forcibly stop any client from leaving, so they do what they can and then report accordingly to law enforcement, the client's authorized representatives and community care licensing (CCL). Staff stated that they did report what the client revealed to them upon the client's return from an unauthorized absence to appropriate authorities.

Facility staff notify social workers when children leave facility unsupervised, however, children usually comeback within the time allotted. Staff only conduct searches if they have probable cause but do consistently conduct room searches. Staff stated that if they see children smoking or doing something illegal they immediately take action and confiscate the contraband. Administrator stated that staff are drug screened and fingerprinted and have worked in the facility for a long time. LPA did not review or receive any documents or reports that identify staff taking part in any illegal activities. Documents reviewed and information received show continued training of staff members in caring for children and all staff members currently being cleared and associated to facility.

Remote \"tele-inspection\" of facilities is a part of Community Care Licensing Division's emergency response to the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the tele-inspection, LPAs Herring and Gutierrez spoke with Trina Smith, Facility Administrator. All pertinent staff and client records were scanned and emailed to the LPAs prior to the tele-inspection upon request. LPAs conducted a facility tour with Ms. Smith at 1: PM. Two records of clients taking psychotropic medications were reviewed at 1: PM. LPAs observed that the Psychotropic Medication Administration Records (PMARs) for C1 and C2 for December 2020 indicates that all AM psychotropic medications (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6) were not administered on 12/13/20. S1 put her initial on the appropriate box for each PMAR and circled her initial to indicate that the medication was not given. However, S1 stated that S3 was the staff scheduled to pass medications on 12/13/20 for the AM shift and that S1 only put her initial on each PMAR form because she was the one who discovered the medication error. There was no documentation or special incident report explaining actions taken and reasons why all psychotropic medications were not administered on 12/13/20 (AM shift). LPAs inspected C2's psychotropic medications at approximately 1: PM. The administrator informed LPAs that C1 has been on a home pass since 2/14/21. C1's medications have been released to his parents, therefore, LPAs were unable to inspect C1's medications. (continued...) LPAs reviewed 2 staff files at approximately 2: PM. LPAs interviewed 1 client at approximately 2: PM. LPAs were unable to interview C1, who was on a home pass at the time of tele-inspection. LPAs interviewed 2 staff members at approximately 2: PM. LPAs reviewed the facility's Plan of Operation prior to the tele-inspection. LPAs conducted an exit interview with Trina Smith, Facility Administrator at approximately 2: PM. LPAs provided Advisory Note -Technical Violation (LIC 9102TV) and Advisory Note - Technical Assistance (LIC 9102TA). One deficiency was observed (refer to LIC 809D) and cited from the California Code of Regulations, Title 22. A copy of this licensing report was provided to the licensee via email.

    "narrative": "Investigation revealed the following: It was alleged facility staff are not appropriately supervising minor in care. Interview conducted with staff were similar and denied the allegation. Staff stated that they have adequate staff throughout each shift to monitor the children in care. Staff stated that children get passes to walk or be in the community but that when children do not return on time or if they aren't allowed to be gone proper agencies are notified and local law enforcement is called, and reports are filed. Staff stated they typically are unaware of what transpires when children run away from facility. However, one staff stated that they were made aware of one incident occurring while one child was on runaway status due to local law enforcement telling them what happened, but staff stated they were not given specifics only questioned about potential locations of child's whereabouts. Children had similar statements and denied the allegation. Children stated that there are adequate staff and that there is adequate staff to meet their needs. Two children had contradictory statements. Children stated that there was adequate staff to supervise them in the home, but that staff don't always answer the phones when children are on outings or wanting to get picked up. Additionally, one child stated that staff don't intervene when children are fighting. However, the information provided for staff was unclear as to if incident occurred in the home or while children were outside on runaway or outing. Child in which this investigation was generated denied speaking with LPA. Documents reviewed identified proper notifications were made pertaining to incident referenced within this investigation and all incidents leading up to and after child returned were documented. Licensing Program Analyst attempted to reach county social worker but was unable to speak with county worker regarding incident but documents reviewed identified no issues or concerns with facility or children being placed in facility. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report Confidential Names Form, and Appeal Rights were provided to the facility representative.

Investigation revealed that STRTP staff took three (3) clients on a supervised walk around the neighborhood, satisfying the staff to client ratio for being outside of the facility. On the walk, the group came upon two additional STRTP clients at a local park who were out of the STRTP on permitted community pass. The two groups interacted and an argument ensued. STRTP staff attempted to de-escalate the argument throughout, getting between participants for separation, only for another to engage from a different angle. By all accounts of the clients involved, STRTP staff did actively supervise the youths and de-escalate to the best of his ability.

    "narrative": "LPA also reviewed pertinent STRTP records, Department databases, and reports from other agencies. The STRTP has two facility vehicles. LPA observed a small sedan, and a white Toyota minivan. LPA was shown the inside of both vehicles. Of note, the white Toyota minivan has capability for seating eight (8) passengers, with the first row consisting of two (2) bucket seats, the rear row consisting of a bench seat for three (3) passengers, and the middle row consisting of two (2) dedicated bucket seats and a fold down seat with seat belt attached to the bucket seats allowing for a third passenger. LPA observed the fold down seat to be cocked in an unusual way, and asked Administrator (A1) about it. A1 said seat was working and attempted to put the seat in place, but being unable to, actually pulled the seat off the hinges and told LPA, \"Oh, I guess it 's broken.\" Interviews with clients (C1, C2, C4, C5) and staff (S1, A1) reveal knowledge of the seat being in disrepair, however LPA is unable to determine whether facility staff allowed clients to use broken seat during transport due to conflicting statements. Further investigation revealed that the facility van was taken to an auto shop on April 20, 2023, for a seat repair. However, the seat is a special order from the dealer and the part is on back order as stated in the work order. The work order was not provided to the LPA during the investigation. The STRTP also states that the facility has another vehicle which can be used to transport clients if additional seats are needed. Although one of the facility van seats is not in good repair, the facility took the van to the repair shop to obtain a work order. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that minor had access to illegal drugs while in care and staff did not provide adequate supervision resulting in minor consuming hand sanitizer. The investigation revealed that the minor returned to the facility from being AWOL and appeared to be under the influence. The minor exhibited unusual behavior and later on asked staff to contact 911 after the minor started vomiting. The minor disclosed drinking hand sanitizer during AWOL. The minor was transported by emergency personnel to the hospital where the minor reported drinking hand sanitizer and using methamphetamines. It was discovered during confidential interviews that the minor obtained hand sanitizer from school and drank it inside the bedroom, after returning to the facility. There was no witness to the incident. The minor engaged in substance abuse while away from the facility and no one from the facility provided the minor with methamphetamines. Staff on duty responded appropriately by monitoring the minor's behavior after returning from AWOL and by immediately seeking medical attention for the minor.

They emphasized their active involvement with the clients, staying informed about each client's daily activities. The staff also assured that they would intervene when necessary to guide clients in adhering to and completing their program. Both the staff and support team stressed the significance of educating clients on condom availability and safe sex practices. They consistently remind clients about the dangers of unprotected sex and the risks of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Regarding the drug use allegation, the staff explained that the facility implements measures to prevent contraband from entering, including conducting self-searches on clients and inspecting all bags. Despite these precautions, clients have succeeded in smuggling contraband by hiding items in areas not easily accessible to staff. If contraband is found, the staff will confiscate, document, and dispose of it appropriately. Information provided by C1 corroborated the aforementioned details, expressing a sense of security while residing at the facility and acknowledging the staff's assistance in achieving their individualized plan. C1 denied involvement with adult females or mistreatment of animals, stating that the only substances used were marijuana and alcohol during AWOL. C1 admitted to fabricating the claims to provoke a reaction from their teacher. Additionally, C1 mentioned that the facility staff are vigilant, conducting visual searches of items brought back to the facility and confiscating any contraband discovered. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated.

LPA met with Administrator George Jordan and Executive Assistant Betheny Jordan and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation at the facility, LPA became aware of deficiencies and areas in which technical support may be beneficial. Based on confidential observations, interviews, and record review, the licensee revised the plan of operation without providing to the licensing agency for review and approval prior to implementation. LPA is issuing a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Plan of Operation. Additionally, the licensee indicated in the revised plan of operation that per county, state, and team recommendations, the facility \"holds sole responsibility\" for visitation procedure changes. LPA advises that per the above cited ILS section, the facility must submit revised plan of operation procedures to the licensing agency for approval. LPA discussed that approval should be obtained prior to implementation. LPA also advised that individual visitation, transportation, and other service plans, and any modifications, be documented in the resident's needs and services plan and that, per ILS Section 87068. Modifications to the Needs and Services Plan, the facility ensure written approval of such modifications is obtained from the authorized representative(s) prior to implementation. Lastly, a transportation arrangement to a resident's medical appointment was made and when the assigned staff member could not provide transportation that day, an on-call staff member or other staff was not made available to ensure transportation. LPA advised that, per ILS Section Transportation, the facility is to ensure transportation to health related services, so to avoid missing future appointments, utilization of on-call staff is encouraged. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Executive Assistant Betheny Jordan.",

At this time, the county is expected to finish their review by August of 2022. During this meeting the following options were discussed; withdrawal of STRTP application by the program, this would prevent CCL (Community Care Licensing) from taking legal action against the program. The facility was informed that if the program is not able to obtain their Mental Health approval by the date of June 30, 2022 the department will have to take legal action. The facility was also informed that they could withdraw their STRTP application and submit a plan of closure.

Food supply was sufficient for non-perishable food and perishable food for one week. Due to the facility being affected by the pandemic, Licensee states they grocery shopping is completed twice a week and that the program now utilizes a grocery delivery service to assist. Due to the recent accreditation process that the program had completed, the facility's client and staff files were temporary relocated at the second location. LPA Belfield will review the files at that location. Medication logs and location were in a locked file cabinet. Client's rooms were clean and all bedding had proper linen. One client's bed was observed to have the box spring off the rails, however this was adjusted during the inspection. LPA observed client files for the three clients that are currently placed in the facility, C1, C2, and, C3 ( see LIC 811 dated 6/16/21). C1 and C2 allowed this LPA to look in their room briefly and did not want this LPA to see their closet. C3 did not want this LPA to look in their room at all, however they changed their minds and asked this LPA to observe. All client's rooms were clean and in good repair. No violations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division Six, or Interim Licensing Standards were cited during this inspection. An exit interview was conducted with Licensee and a copy of this report will be sent to Licensee Jamie Richard.",

Community Care Licensing (CCL) met with Administrator, Rachel McCormick and Consultant, Tricca Leverenz. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the Mental Health Program Approval (MHPA) and the required items for permanent licensure for JR Northstar I & II. The facility's 24 month STRTP provisional expires on June 30, 2022. The facility submitted their MHPA to DHCS on April 12, 2022. DHCS cannot move forward with the application until the facility finds a qualified Head of Service and the facility is contracted by Contra Costa County Behavioral Health. At this time, the county is expected to finish their review by August of 2022. During this meeting the following options were discussed; withdrawal of STRTP application by the program, this would prevent CCL (Community Care Licensing) from taking legal action against the program. The facility was informed that if the program is not able to obtain their Mental Health approval by the date of June 30, 2022 the department will have to take legal action. The facility was also informed that they could withdraw their STRTP application and submit a plan of closure. The facility will have an internal discussion, and the Administrator, Rachel McCormick will contact LPM Mendoza on when they will submit their closure plan to CCL, or notify LPM if there are any immediate changes with DHCS or their county contract. A copy of this report was emailed to the facility for signature.",

The marijuana was provided by S1 to the clients in the form of a \"wax pen\" and a \"pipe\". Sources revealed the encounters would occur outside of the facility during \"walks\" or while S1 was in the facility vehicle with the clients. S1 admitted to Investigator Douglas that she provided and smoked marijuana with the minor clients. Confidential independent interviews with clients residing in the facility at the time, further corroborate claims as some residents admitted to smoking marijuana out of S1's \"wax pen\" with S1 on several occasions and S1's \"pipe\" on at least one occasion. Upon discovery of said incident, S1 was terminated from her position at the facility. Facility representatives notified all required parties and conducted an internal investigation pertaining to the incident. (Continued on pg.

C1 was able to get into the safe because she had seen the PIN number as a staff person opened the safe while C1 was in the staff office. C1 was able to access a sharp knife when the drawer was unlocked during a meal preparation. C1 threatened to harm herself and was transported to a hospital to be assessed for a 5150 hold. C1 was released later that evening (9-13-20) and returned to the facility. To ensure the safety of staff and youth the facility social worker and facility administrator developed a plan of correction. The staff were retrained on Koinonia procedures and C1 is not to be in the staff office. Staff are to keep the sharp knives drawer locked during meal preparation. The medication safe will not be opened while youth are in the office or when the office door is open. A second incident report submitted on 9-15-20 noted that C1 had taken money from the house budget wallet during a transport from school to the facility. C1 was able to get the money because the staff's purse was in between the van seats. Staff have been instructed to keep their purses in the van safe while transporting youths. End.",

Four staff and three youths describe, in separate interviews, the process of receiving TA. The interviews confirm staff and residents have a similar understanding of the consequence system. The therapeutic assignment and the corresponding consequences are not included in the facility program statement.

LPA met with Administrator Sonam Prasad and informed of the purpose of the visit. The Licensing agency was informed that the facility caught a staff member on camera footage smoking marijuana on facility grounds. Based on record review and interview with Administrator, the staff member continued to work their shift after smoking marijuana, there were three residents present at this time, and one staff lead working with the staff. The facility had faced some challenges with the staff prior, provided the staff member additional training, and when other staff reported a concern that the staff member had smelled like marijuana one day when they were on shift, the Administrator spoke to the staff member about this less than a month prior and sent a follow-up email. Once the facility became aware of the incident, by seeing the facility camera footage, the staff member was directed to not come to their shift and instead report to the office. The staff member was to be terminated. However, the staff member resigned before showing to the office. LPA reviewed and obtained copies of staff records, including the follow-up email and staff training documentation. Per Administrator, the smoking policy is to not smoke on the premises, inside or outside, and this covers all substances. Staff are not to be intoxicated in any way on their shifts. Apart from onboarding training that all staff receive, no training or reminder about smoking and intoxication has been provided to the staff yet following this incident, but a staff meeting is planned for today, and Administrator agreed to include this as a topic. LPA is issuing a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Buildings and Grounds and a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision.

During an investigation at the facility, LPA conducted confidential interviews with staff, residents, and witnesses and review of facility records. Through this, the following was learned and/or observed. The facility does not have a facility manager designated for each shift. Per the plan of operation (POO), \"At least one staff member each shift shall be designated as Facility Manager. When the House Manager is working a shift, he is considered the Facility Manager for that shift.\" Per applicable licensing requirements, there shall be a facility manager present whenever the administrator is absent and children are present, including the night shift. Currently, the facility has one designated facility manager, who is also not fully qualified, and who does not work the night shift. LPA is issuing a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Personnel Requirements. The facility admitted a youth without consulting with the full team as indicated in the POO, and only provided 1-2 days of notice of the intake. Per the POO, \"When possible, the intake interview will include the La Cheim STRTP psychiatric nurse as well as the La Cheim STRTP Program Administrator... Emergency Placements are discussed with our Program Director who will then consider the case and consult with our Psychiatric Team before giving a decision on intake.\" A recently admitted youth was admitted without consultation with the CCL approved administrator and without the psychiatric team.

LPA met with Head of Services Dae'Jah Foster and Administrator Sonam Prasad and informed of the purpose of the visit. The POCs were developed and agreed upon on 2/17/23 for five citations issued on that day, under an LIC 809 and a LIC 9099, both dated 2/17/23. The due date for all POCs was 3/3/23. Submissions were received for 3, and 2 were missing. After the due date, licensee made a request for an extension but did not specify for what or until when. On 3/8/23, a complete request was received. Due to being past the initial due date, the extension is not being granted. At visit, LPA confirmed that the 2 missing POCs were incomplete. These were Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87022(f), due to not following intake procedures outlined in the plan of operation, and Section 87065(f) due to not having facility manager coverage during administrator absence. LPA is assessing two civil penalties for failure to correct, each of $100 per day beginning 3/4/23 and continuing until complete, for a total of $600 each as of today. LPA emphasizes that POCs should be submitted by tomorrow to avoid continuing fees. Additionally, during review of the LIC POC requiring training on consequences, LPA observed that the submitted training slides included discussion of a 10-day consequence for returning after curfew where home visits would be prohibited for 6-9 days. LPA confirmed this has been implemented as a consequence, although it has only recently been implemented for curfew violations. However, the plan of operation (Section 17 of the program statement) states that \"discipline will not be used to deny home visits.\" LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section Plan of Operation as well as assessing a civil penalty for repeat violation of $250, as this section was previously cited on 2/17/23. LPA also advises that per STRTP ILS Section 87072, denying home visits without a court order is personal rights violation, so this policy would not be approved.

Lastly, per applicable licensing requirements and the POO, the facility manager shall have either a bachelor's degree or two years of experience working with the population to be served or equivalent. When hired in October 2022, the facility manager had five months of experience as a direct care staff at the facility.

Additionally, at least one resident has purchased their own food and keeps their own food supply in their room and has done so after requesting staff purchase preferred foods and those foods not being obtained and/or prepared. LPA observed the facility to require cleaning and multiple repairs. Outside, LPA observed trash and contraband in the side yard, including an empty water jug, two empty cigarette packs, and one lighter with lighter fluid. LPA removed the cigarette packs and lighter and handed to Administrator for disposal. LPA observed a broken support beam under the back deck that had swung to the ground. Downstairs, LPA observed the bathroom toilet roll holder to be missing with a large screw exposed. The bathroom light switch cover was loose with a loose nail. The dressers in both downstairs bedrooms had missing drawer knobs and sharp screws exposed where the knobs would screw on. In one of the downstairs bedrooms, there is a heavily stained mattress with a hole in it, which Administrator stated would be replaced. The window screens were torn, and the curtain rod was pulled from the wall fixture. Upstairs, LPA observed a dresser with no drawer knobs, resulting in difficulty opening the drawers. There were two large holes in the wall of one of the bedrooms, graffiti on a ceiling beam, on the window, on the dresser, and on the front and back of the door. The graffiti on the door included gang-related symbols/lettering and profanity that speaks negatively of the facility and specific staff members. The door frame is also broken. There is currently a resident in this room, and Administrator stated the graffiti and holes were caused by a former resident and that the current resident moved into the room with this damage present. Administrator stated that the resident cannot be moved to one of the vacant bedrooms downstairs due to a runaway risk. When LPA arrived, there were two residents and one staff, Administrator. One of the residents is a known runaway risk. Staffing should be increased to provide extra supervision and meet this resident's needs. Administrator provided evidence of their correspondence with licensee on getting these issues addressed. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated.

The minutes of meetings of the board of directors related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth's safety plans, crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

    "narrative": "The allegation that facility staff did not ensure that C1 participates in school is related to C1 not attending schooling since October 2020. While the facility staff interviewed stated that they witnessed C1 logging in virtually and engaging in school, regularly. Staff reported that they witnessed C1 completing school work and engaging with teachers while logged on. Facility staff states that C1 was in attendance almost daily and states that despite being in attendance, the facility would get calls daily about not attending school. Staff states that they even called the school office in hopes to rectify the situation but the daily calls continued to be received. CSW states that C1 missing that many days and not being in school is not true. CSW states that C1's school was in direct contact with CSW and had CSW's email but CSW was not notified of any concerns about this prolonged absence(s) from school. LPA sent emails to C1's school requesting information related to C1's attendance 4/9/21 and 8/24/21 and no information was received. LPA was also informed when attempting to contact the school that LPA is not authorized to receive this information without written consent or court order. The allegation that S1 utilized an improper restraint is a result of C1 reporting that C1 was not allowed to leave the staff office when C1 wanted to and that S1 placed themselves between C1 and the exit door. C1 reported that S1 blocked C1 in the staff office and denied C1 the ability to leave the office when C1 wanted to exit. C1 could not recall when this happened. There are no witnesses found and no incident reported that would indicate when this allegation happened or if it happened. S1 denied that C1 was ever blocked in the staff office and prevented to leave at any time. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, LPA Hill finds that the allegations that facility staff did not provide minor adequate supervision, facility staff did not ensure that minor participates in school and facility staff utilized an improper restraint are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

Ms. Johnson was informed that the investigation included an initial virtual inspection at the facility on 4/9/21, a subsequent in-person inspection conducted on 7/16/21, interviews with C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6 (see LIC811 dated 8/25/21) as well as interviews with four staff, complainant and county social worker (CSW). LPA was also provided with C1's Needs and Services Plan and staff contact information. The allegation that facility staff did not provide adequate supervision is related to C1 leaving on an unauthorized absence and staff not shadowing or looking for C1. Incident report received 4/3/21 indicates that C1 did go on an unauthorized absence 3/27/21. After C1 did not return on their own \"after giving C1 time\", and C1 could not be located in the area, law enforcement was contacted and a missing persons report was filed. CSW stated that they were aware that the facility would give C1 time to calm down and did sometimes follow but not always due to the availability of staff to do this. CSW stated that C1 would usually return on their own after calming down. CSW stated that there was no formal plan related to this time away in the Needs and Services Plan.

All staff were consistent in their telling of the event, that they did not restrain the youth because the facility avoids physical holds, but that they did keep R1's hands down when in the facility office while they unravelled a phone cord that R1 had wrapped around R1's neck when upset and stating R1 wanted to die.

LPA met with Administrator Nina Davis and informed of the purpose of the visit. There were no children present during today's visit. The inspection was initiated on Tuesday 9/21/21. Refer to LIC Facility Evaluation Report, dated 9/21/21. LPA used the Inspection Tool to conduct the inspection. LPA inspected the facility site, conducted interviews with all present staff and residents, and reviewed current staff and client files, including files for recently discharged resident and staff who recently left facility. The facility was observed to be safe and free of immediate hazards. There are no firearms on the premises, per Administrator. Chemicals and medications are properly stored and inaccessible to residents. Medication administration is logged correctly and, based on staff interviews, medication administration procedures are thorough and followed correctly. Facility is maintained at a comfortable temperature. Residents report that the program provides a supportive environment. The facility is operating in accordance with their license. Staff have background clearances and are associated to the facility. The following concerns were observed: LPA observed the following: Sliding door handle broken; curtain rod over sliding door needs to be drilled back into the wall; large tear in living room sofa with stuffing spilling out; broken microwave door and handle; 3 bedroom doors are broken and/or have large holes, and 1 of those doors does not close due to damage; 4 holes in walls upstairs that have not been repaired; lights in the large bedroom's en-suite bathroom were non-functioning, including the toilet room light. Some items are pre-existing, and LPA was advised they would be fixed soon, so the repairs are still in-progress. Damages at site are not determined to cause an immediate risk to residents. LPA issued a citation of Title 22, Section Buildings and Grounds. LPA observed that the needs and services plans for resident R1, R2, and R3 (Refer to LIC Confidential Names, dated 9/24/21) were not available on site for review. LPA was informed by clinician that a needs and services had not been updated for resident R1 since the pre-placement. R1 was placed on 7/2/21. LPA issued a citation of STRTP Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87068. Modifications to the Needs and Services Plan. Needs and services plans should be updated every 30 days, noting any progress in the youth's case plan and can provide an opportunity to document what, if any, information from outside agencies is still being obtained. LPA observed that documentation of successful completion of training was not maintained in the personnel record for each staff. LPA is unable to verify training and that all hours of initial training and the 40 hours of annual training have been completed if not properly documented/logged. Current records do not reflect that all training was met, including for staff S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6. LPA issued a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87065. Training Requirements. LPA observed that the facility has developed and is using a clearly organized chart for initial training that could be adapted for documenting annual training. LPA observed that the hot water in the upstairs hallway bathroom measured at a high of 154. F, which exceeds the permitted ranged. A hot water warning notice was posted at the sink, complying with Title 22, Section Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment, and Supplies. LPA advises that the facility continue to monitor the hot water temperature at vanity sinks and adjust hot water settings as necessary to ensure temperatures do not go above F. Three citations and one advisory were issued at this visit. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was provided to Administrator Nina Davis, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

During this inspection, 10 out of Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 3 youth files were reviewed. 4 out of Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 3 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, March 15, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Davis.",

    "narrative": "On 4/20/22 at 3PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit to the facility regarding deficiencies that were discovered during an investigation at the facility. LPA met with Administrator Nina Davis and informed of the purpose of the visit. Safety precautions were taken, including mask-wearing and screening call. The investigation was conducted by the Investigations Branch. During investigation, confidential interviews were conducted with residents, staff, and authorized representative, and police report was reviewed. Based on interviews and record review, the following deficiencies were found. Staff S1 (See LIC Confidential Names, dated 4/20/22) used a disallowed restraint technique, by placing resident R1 in a prone restraint, per the program statement emergency intervention plan, which states, \"Interventions Never to Be Used... Prone restraint, unless written authorization has been provided by the youth's physician, based upon their prior physical examination of the youth.\" Based on file review, the facility did not obtain such written authorization documentation, as R1 was not in placement long enough to get a medical and physical assessment. Additionally, the file contains a Health & Education Passport, dated 12/28/21, that lists asthma as one of R1's conditions, which is listed as a risk factor in prone restraints in the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87095. Emergency Intervention Prohibitions. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87022(f) Plan of Operation. During the prone restraint, R1 placed R1's own hands behind their back, and S1 held R1's hands down to keep R1 down in the restraint, as witnessed by S2, and by doing so held R1 in a prohibited restraint. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section Section 87095.01(a)(5) Emergency Interventions Prohibition, which specifically prohibits the use at any time of any restraint that places a child in a prone position with their hands behind their back. LPA also advises, per STRTP ILS Section 87095.66(c) that any restraint requiring two staff, such as prone restraints, must be performed with two staff. Additionally, at visit LPA inspected the personnel record for S1 and found there was no intervention training certificate. The program statement indicates the facility will use Pro-Act, but Administrator stated the facility does not perform restraints. The personnel record does not reflect that S1 was properly trained and certified prior to using the restraint technique, and S1 and Administrator confirmed that S1 has not been trained since working with licensee's facilities. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87095.65(a) Emergency Intervention Staff Training. It was also learned during the investigation, based on S1's statements, that S1 made statements to R1 such as, \"This is the best home you'll ever be in, don't mess it up.\" This statement does not align with supported trauma-informed care practices and is emotionally abusive in nature. Staff statement that R1 is \"bad for business\" also indicates an inappropriate attitude toward R1. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87072(c)(11) Personal Rights. Lastly, the incident report submitted by licensee and written by staff S1 for the incident during which S1 performed the prone restraint does not include information about the restraint. As such, Administrator stated she was unaware that a restraint had been performed. The incident report is also lacking detail of the events, does not indicate when staff notified law enforcement or what items were damaged, and includes language (i.e. \"verbal judo\") that Administrator is unfamiliar with and cannot verify as part of the progam's intervention plan. LPA is issuing a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87095.61(a) Documentation and Reporting Requirements. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Administrator Nina Davis, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "A replacement was found after calling multiple care staff. Based on the interviews with residents, staff did night checks but possibly not after a certain hour. It is unclear what time resident R1 left the facility. R1 reported R1 left out the bedroom window at 11:30PM and that there weren't any room checks after 8PM. R1's roommate reported R1 left at 9:30PM and that staff were doing regular checks. S1 reported the last check in was at 11PM. It is possible that S1 called the advice nurse about the chest pain around the same time that S1 went upstairs and did the check ins, but it is also possible that due to their chest pain, S1 may not have been able to make it upstairs to check on youth. It is possible that a lack of supervision from either a lack of check ins or the delay in finding a replacement staff due to not having an on-call staff allowed for R1 to AWOL and travel to another city. R1 has a known history of being an AWOL risk and having relationships with older men. The issue with invading the youths' privacy is an understandable concern. However, if a youth is asleep, the only way to check on them is to have sight of them so you do not disturb their sleep. Morning staff reported a teddy bear was in the bed when they tapped the \"body\" and pulled the covers, so even if night staff had done a check in by sight, they still may not have realized the youth had left. It was reported that the reason there was no on-call staff designated in the absence of a facility manager was because staff were unwilling to for concerns of not being properly paid. LPA was not able to determine if this was the case. The only staff designated facility responsibility and on-call status at that time was S2. Further, the Director and Assistant Director could not be reached. However, S2 was responsive and did assist in finding a staff to take over the night shift. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with residents and staff, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. LPA is issuing an advisory per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 84065. Staff/Child Ratios. Additionally, LPA is issuing an advisory per Health and Safety Code Sections 1522.4(a). The facility has since been licensed as STRTP, but this incident occurred when facility was still a group home. LPA advises the facility review STRTP ILS Section 87065. Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios, as there are additional requirements regarding on-call staff for STRTPs.

    "narrative": "... stated they drove into the youth to get the youth to move but later denied this in interview with LPA. Based on LPA's review of video footage, R1 placed self on the hood and windshield of the vehicle and was directed by staff to get off of the vehicle. The vehicle appears to be stopped at this time. R1 removes self from the vehicle, and as R1 steps off and away from the vehicle, the vehicle is propelled forward about a foot at approximately 5- MPH. The speed is low but is high enough to indicate the gas was pressed rather than just the brake being lifted. R1's body is very close to the vehicle, and R1's hand is either still on the vehicle or had just been removed. From the driver's side, from where the video is shot, it is not clear that R1 would not be hit by the vehicle. However, R1 does not show signs of being hit. The vehicle's horn is then honked 6 times in succession. There is no apparent purpose for the honking other than perhaps to warn R1 from walking in front of the vehicle as it is now moving. Based on this footage, LPA determines that the staff operating the vehicle did not act appropriately, and their actions put the health and safety of R1 at risk. Individuals should not jump onto vehicles, and individuals should demonstrate extra caution when operating vehicles around others, especially if others are making attempts to place themselves on top of the vehicle. Additionally, during this incident, staff S1 confirmed to police that S1 stated to youth R2 when R2 pulled out a knife, \"You're bringing a knife to a gun fight,\" though S1 later denied this in interview with LPA. Police found an illegally concealed firearm during a search of S1's vehicle. S1 stated to police that S1 did not know at the time that S1's coworker (S2) had put S2's gun in S1's vehicle after extensive damage was caused to S2's vehicle earlier that day. S1 denied brandishing the weapon. Based on involved resident interview, S1 made a statement about not we're fighting but we're shooting. Based on record review and confidential interviews, S1 made a statement to R2 of a threatening nature that was a highly inappropriate thing to say to a child in care at a STRTP facility, as the statement could reasonably be interpreted by the youth as a threat. Multiple charges were filed against S1 by police, including assault with a deadly weapon, criminal threats, and cruelty to a child. The charges were ultimately dropped, but there is no evidence in supplemental reports that contradicts the findings mentioned above. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. LPA is issuing a citation per California Code of Regulations, Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Personal Rights. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights and a copy of this report were provided to Asst. Director La Tanya Harper, whose signature on this form confirms receipt. ... stated they drove into the youth to get the youth to move but later denied this. Based on LPA's review of video footage, R1 placed self on the hood and windshield of the vehicle and was directed by staff to get off of the vehicle. The vehicle appears to be stopped at this time. R1 removes self from the vehicle, and as R1 steps off and away from the vehicle, the vehicle is propelled forward about a foot at approximately 5- MPH. The speed is low but is high enough to indicate the gas was pressed rather than just the brake being lifted. R1's body is very close to the vehicle, and R1's hand is either still on the vehicle or had just been removed. From the driver's side, from where the video is shot, it is not clear that R1 would not be hit by the vehicle. However, R1 does not show signs of being hit. The vehicle's horn is then honked 6 times in succession. There is no apparent purpose for the honking other than perhaps to warn R1 from walking in front of the vehicle as it is now moving. Based on this footage, LPA determines that the staff operating the vehicle did not act appropriately, and their actions put the health and safety of R1 at risk. Individuals should not jump onto vehicles, and individuals should demonstrate extra caution when operating vehicles around others, especially if others are making attempts to place themselves on top of the vehicle. However, based on record review and confidential interviews, it is not clear that any of the injuries R1 sustained were caused by staff's actions rather than by R1's own actions. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with residents and staff, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Asst. Director La Tanya Harper, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

LPA met with Administrator Nina Davis and informed of the purpose of the visit. LPA used the Inspection Tool to complete the annual inspection. LPA toured the facility site and observed the facility to be clean and sanitary. Administrator informed LPA that the facility plans to get a new dusting rod to remove a hanging web/dust web in the entry way and to haul the old mattresses currently stored in the garage to the dump. Commonly touched services are sanitized regularly. Pool in backyard has a pool cover. Per Administrator, there are no firearms on the premises. Sharps and medications are stored in the locked closet in the entryway. First aid kit is stored centrally. Scissors and tweezers are missing from the first aid kit.

    "narrative": "On Thursday 2/3/22 at 9:16AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins made a visit to the facility to review training records, per the agreement established at the Noncompliance Conference on 9/23/21. The agreed upon terms were that the licensee would be subject to increased monitoring for at least 12 months and the licensee is to conduct monthly trainings on any of these topics: trauma-informed care practices, safe vehicle operation, proper de-escalation procedures when following residents in a vehicle, and firearm storage and safety. LPA met with Administrator Nina Davis and informed of the purpose of the visit. LPA also spoke to Assistant Director La Tanya Harper over the phone to discuss the report. Safety precautions were taken, including LPA wearing an N95 mask, hand hygiene and gloves, and screening call. LPA reviewed the training binder, training logs, and training certificates and obtained copies of the training logs. LPA observed the following: 1) Staff S1, S2, and S3 (See LIC Confidential Names) have not attended a training on firearms, per the logs. LPA advises that a make-up training be held for these staff members. 2) The AWOL Procedures training covered safe vehicle operation, based on the training materials previously provided to LPA, but the training log does not clearly reflect this, and the materials were not available in the binder due to being stored at the administrative office location. LPA advises that, since the requirement to have trainings on safe vehicle operation is in response to a staff member's unsafe operation of a vehicle during an AWOL incident, the materials be available for review at the facility site to verify for anyone reviewing the logs that it covered safe vehicle operation and/or that another all-staff training be conducted that specifically covers safe vehicle operation and is titled to reflect that. The training log is otherwise complete, and the licensee is in compliance. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator Nina Davis and Assistant Director La Tanya Harper over the phone. There are no citations. A copy of this report was provided to Administrator Nina Davis, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

During this inspection, 6 out of Direct Care Staff and 1 out of 1 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of Direct Care Staff and 1 out of 1 youth were interviewed.(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, May 12, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, monthly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Nina Davis.",

LPA met with Direct Care Staff Keisha Ward and Direct Care Counselor Imani Richardson and informed of the purpose of the visit. Pre-visit contact was made in the morning of the day of visit. LPA reviewed the training binder, training logs, and training certificates and obtained copies/scans of the training logs. LPA observed the following: 1) At the last visit, on 2/3/22, it was observed that not all staff had attended a training on firearm safety. At today's visit, it was observed that the staff missing the training have since attended. 2) All except for one staff have been trained on safe operation of vehicles. 3) The facility is conducting trainings on listed, and related, topics about every 30 days / monthly, per the agreement. However, per the training logs, not all staff have attended trainings. Two staff training logs do not reflect any trainings have been completed since 3/29/22, and one staff training log does not reflect any training since 3/9/22. Staff logs reflect that staff have completed as much as 20 hours and as little as 8 hours of training in the past 12 months and do not reflect that the 40hr requirement has been met. 4) Lastly, LPA observed that staff on site, who is the only staff present while two residents are present, is not trained to the level of a facility manager. The 4PM shift's staff were also not facility managers. LPA is issuing two citations, per Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Personnel Requirements and Section 87065.

Per the facility's program statement, \"Transportation is provided to all youth/NMDs to school unless the youth/NMD prefers to walk to school in which in that case it is right for their age, developmental level, maturity and it's in their Needs and Service Treatment Plan,\" which was not followed. Further, Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Transportation provides that facilities shall ensure transportation is provided to residents with any special arrangements agreed upon with the care team and documented in the needs and services. Based on confidential interviews and record review, staff perform room searches with two staff and the resident(s) present during the search. This policy/procedure is not listed in the facility program statement. Additionally, based on confidential interviews, multiple reports indicated that staff have made inappropriate comments and spoken inappropriately of or with residents, including referring to resident as nasty for making a mess and discussing a resident and their personal matters around or with other residents. One of these staff is no longer employed by the licensee. Based on confidential interviews, staff did open a resident's expected mailed ID in order to make a copy of it and has done this before. However, it is not a policy or a trend that staff will open residents' mail, and no mail is withheld from residents. Staff do request that residents open packages in front of staff in order to log it on residents' inventory list and to ensure the item is not dangerous or contraband. Resident reports indicate this has not been an issue for residents. However, this is not listed in the facility program statement, and residents have a right to confidentiality in the mail they receive. Lastly, based on confidential interviews, a resident requested to be taken to the emergency room for pain, but staff did not agree to transport resident. Resident and a peer called 911, and when the ambulance arrived, staff spoke to the medics, who then left. Later that night, the resident again expressed their concern of their pain, and staff called the advice nurse, who advised the resident be taken to the emergency room, and the resident was transported by ambulance due to the late hour. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. LPA is issuing citations of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections Plan of Operation and Health Related Services and STRTP ILS Sections Transportation and Personal Rights. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Assistant Administrator La Tanya Harper, whose signature on this form confirms receipt. Based on confidential interviews, staff do provide transportation to the hospital, but if an incident occurs in the middle of the night, when the ratio only requires one staff on shift and on-call staff cannot arrive quickly enough, staff will allow a resident to be transported by ambulance. LPA advises that per Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87065. Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios, facilities with a capacity of 6 or fewer residents, when one or more residents are present, shall have at least one direct care staff on call and capable of arriving to the facility within 30 minutes. Based on confidential interviews and record review, a resident had a medical visit on 11/14/21, and the visit summary advised a follow-up appointment be made for one (1) week later, which would be around 11/21/21. Medical records reflect that multiple visits were made, but no visit summary for a visit around this time was observed. Based on interviews and record review, some appointments were cancelled or could not be scheduled within the physician's requested time frame, and some health appointments the resident elected to not go to. Resident records do not reflect a trend of not scheduling doctor appointments. There is insufficient information to determine that appointments are not made for residents. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or is/are valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation(s) is/are unsubstantiated.

Additionally, the resident was a known risk for unauthorized leaves, which the facility expressed concerns with to the resident's authorized representative, but the facility found 1:1 supervision inaffective for the resident due to the resident becoming agitated by increased staff monitoring and being near staff, resulting in 1:1 supervision being terminated for the resident. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be substantiated. Due to the known risk for unauthorized leaves and not reporting the leave(s) immediately to the police, per facility protocol, LPA is issuing a citation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section Plan of Operation. See attached LIC 9099-D. LPA also advises that per Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87065.5, the facility shall increase the number of direct care staff when a resident requires special care and supervision due to behavior. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Assistant Administrator La Tanya Harper, whose signature on this form confirms receipt. Additionally, the resident was a known risk for unauthorized leaves, which the facility expressed concerns with to the resident's authorized representative, but the facility found 1:1 supervision ineffective for the resident due to the resident becoming agitated by increased staff monitoring and being near staff, resulting in 1:1 supervision being terminated for the youth. There is not sufficient information to determine if a violation led to the incident occurring. Additionally, based on confidential interviews and record review, drug use is not allowed in the facility, and it has either not been witnessed by some parties or staff have been observed to confiscate contraband when they become aware of it. The facility is reported to have a menu residents enjoy, staff make quality meals and accommodate residents' dietary needs and preferences, residents are able to make their own meals if they prefer, and the facility was observed to have a large store of healthy food. However, at multiple visits, LPA observed food out of date or expired, including significantly moldy fruit that was exposed and accessible to residents. There is not sufficient information to prove that food service is overall inadequate. Further, based on confidential interviews, most residents report that staff do not bully and are not aggressive with residents. Staff use verbal intervention during altercations, but do not use physical intervention and are hands-off. Lastly, it was reported that medical documentation for a resident could not be located in order to provide to a paramedic who responded to the facility. The specific documentation could not be clarified, and LPA was able to have access to medical documentation. However, LPA advises that the facility ensure medical documentation is accessible to care staff in case of an emergency so that medical information can be provided to authorized parties. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or is/are valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation(s) is/are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Assistant Administrator La Tanya Harper, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

The complaint alleged that during this verbal argument, staff did not treat youth with dignity. After the review of documentation and interviews with relevant parties, it was found that the allegation could not be corroborated due to insufficient evidence. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is UNSUBSTANTIATED.

A probation officer who oversaw this case reported that Probation would not pick up R1 because R1 did violate probation. R1's social worker reported that the facility told the social worker that they refused to pick up R1 and bring back into care, because they felt that R1 was not fit for congregate care.

LPA was granted entry by Facility Manager Cheryl Scott, and Interim Administrator Tracy McWoodson arrived at 11:25AM. LPA used the Inspection Tool to conduct the inspection. LPA obtained copies of the following: Current LIC Personnel Report, LIC Emergency Disaster Plan. At 4:30PM, the inspection was not completed. Additional time is needed in order to finish the inspection and the report pages. LPA advised that an annual continuation inspection will be conducted at a later date. LPA inspection today included: 10:35AM Tour: The facility is clean and in good repair. There are some minor wear and tear damages that do not affect functionality and are being addressed with work orders, so repairs are pending. License is visibly posted in staff office. Personal rights and foster youth bill of rights are posted in the living room. First aid kit was observed to be complete. Chemicals and detergents are stored in locked cabinets in the laundry room and garage. Medications and sharps are stored in a locked closet in the living room. The facility is maintained at a comfortable temperature, and hot water in the upstairs hallway bathroom measured within permitted range, at 112. F. 1PM File Review: Files are well organized. Medication Administration Records (MARs) are orderly, and psychotropic medications are logged on the appropriate form. File review will continue during the annual continuation visit. During visit, LPA observed that staff S1 (See LIC Confidential Names) is not showing as associated to the facility but appears on the schedule (LIC 500). At 3:35PM, Assistant Director La Tanya Harper made the clearance transfer via Guardian so S1 appeared on the roster. S1 does not need to be removed from the schedule, but a citation of California Code of Regulations, Section 80019 was issued with a mandated civil penalty of $500.

    "narrative": "The needs and services plan dated 10/21/21 includes the following: \"Transition Plan: [R1]'s current plan is to graduate high school and move back with her grandmother or transition to a county connected independent living program. The staff and counselors at Lighthouse Mentoring Center are supporting [R1]'s connection with her grandmother and guiding and educating her on the resources available through the Independent Living Program. Additionally, [R1] is working on developing other independent living skills, such as securing, and retaining employment, budgeting and managing her own transportation.\" The complaint report was filed on 10/20/21 in response to an incident that day. The transition plan was updated after the incident. Administrator informed LPA that the plan was not updated before because the plan to manage own transportation had been verbally discussed and agreed upon at a CFT. This was, though, before R1 changed schools. Additionally, the facility did not have a record of bus routes that R1 was to utilize to make their way home, and Administrator was unaware of what bus route R1 would need to take to get home to the facility, which is a safety concern. Based on LPA's review of local bus routes, the 9-minute car ride home would have taken R1 an average of 2 hours to get home by bus. The only route that would be quicker (but still 90 minutes) costs more than the amount of money R1 is provided to self-transport. Multiple routes require multiple transfers, and R1 is a known AWOL risk, per interview and record review. Staff are able to transport youth to work after school on days R1 works, but the facility does not have a schedule for R1's job, because the employer does not provide these to R1. However, staff availability indicates that staff are available to pick up the youth after school. Further, the route home from R1's previous school was about 37 to 44 minutes by bus. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegation is found to be Substantiated. There is one citation. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Administrator Tracy McWoodson, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

During this inspection, 7 out of Direct Care Staff and 5 out of 5 youth files were reviewed. 4 out of Direct Care Staff and 5 out of 5 youth were interviewed.(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, April 27, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, monthly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Tracy McWoodson.",

S1 reported that S2 was made aware of this and was nearby downstairs with another resident but may not have been able to see the residents upstairs. S2 reported that S2 was not made aware that S1 was using the restroom and that S2 was in the kitchen area with the fifth resident in care. S2 responded when called by the residents. The lighter, and per staff statements, multiple lighters on multiple occasions, were confiscated from R3. However, due to lack of supervision, the lighter could not be confiscated at the time of the incident, the incident of R3 using a dangerous item could not be prevented or intervened, and R3's injury could not be prevented. Further, resident and staff statements indicate that staff interactions with youth are not always trauma-informed and that multiple staff members at times use an inappropriate and disrespectful tone with residents when delivering information or explaining consequences. When staff share information with residents, the tone, word choice, and body language are important in delivery of that information. Additionally, if a resident responds negatively to a staff statement, staff are responsible for ensuring they use trauma-informed care, per policy procedures, to calm the resident, communicate their intentions, and to maintain the relationship between staff and residents and the health and safety of the resident. Staff tone and attitude contribute significantly to the environment in the facility.

During this inspection, 5 out of Direct Care Staff and 5 out of 5 youth files were reviewed. 3 out of Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 5 youth were interviewed.(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, March 14, 2023). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, monthly assessment, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Tracy McWoodson.",

    "narrative": "During another incident, one resident was downstairs in the front living room on a phone call monitored by the staff on duty. Another resident was upstairs, unsupervised. The front living room is visible from the upstairs landing and hallway, but the main kitchen/dining/family room area is not visible from the front living room. The resident upstairs came downstairs, entered the main kitchen/dining/family room, and exited the facility through the back sliding door. This resident then returned about 5 minutes later with contraband not visible to staff, and returned upstairs. The investigation found that the call the resident was on was not a required supervised call but that staff observe the resident on the phone to ensure the resident does not make unapproved calls afterward, as the resident does have a list of calls that need to be approved and/or supervised. Later, both residents were in one of their bedrooms and shared the contraband, which was learned to be a can of alcohol and a nicotine vaporizer pen obtained by the resident who exited the facility from an adult not affiliated with the facility. Additionally, multiple reports obtained described supervision at the facility as relaxed or that staff are disengaged or distracted on their phones. The incident report submitted for this incident also did not reflect that engagement or redirection was done. Lastly, the staff could have been stationed upstairs and had sight of the resident on the phone or could have engaged with the resident who exited the facility and continued listening for a break in the phone discussion or for redialing, or the facility could have increased staffing to meet the extra supervision needs of the resident with required monitored phone use. Regarding the third allegation above, the reports obtained indicate that due to a lack of supervision allowing residents to enter other residents' rooms, multiple residents have had their personal belongings stolen by other residents, and sometimes those items have been destroyed, including clothing, a journal, and a family photo. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. LPA is issuing citations of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), section Plan of Operation and 87065. Personnel Duties. See attached LIC 9099-D.

    "narrative": "Additionally, reports obtained indicate that supervision procedures are not being followed consistently, with some reporting that staff check on residents every 30 minutes, every hour, or less often. This does not align with the supervision model outlined in the POO. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated. LPA is issuing citations of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) sections Plan of Operation and 87065. Personnel Duties. See attached LIC 9099-D. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Administrator Tracy McWoodson, whose signature on this form confirms receipt. Personal inventory records reflect that the resident in question had a collection of clothes, and interviews with individuals who observed the resident did not support that the youth did not have enough clothes. Some reports obtained indicated that residents exchanged clothes and that this practice has continuously been discouraged by facility staff. Similarly, some reports obtained indicated that residents shared electronic devices, but that, since not all residents are permitted by their authorized representative to have certain devices, such as a cell phone or other other electronic communication device, that this practice is also discouraged by facility staff. Additionally, it was reported that the resident in question had their electronic device taken away by the facility. However, interview with the authorized representative and staff indicated that the resident did not have an electronic device while in the program, so no device could have been taken away. Lastly, the allowance records reflected regular allowance dispersal, and residents interviewed support that allowance procedures are followed. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "The email chain does not reflect clear communication in responding to the request to confirm the correct details, but staff picking up the resident on Monday indicates agreement with the plan. There was mention that the resident was not picked up on Tuesday due to the facility not having enough gas in the van, which was not supported by all involved staff member(s) but which was supported by the email chain correspondence. The correspondence indicated that there was no issue with gas because the facility had only intended to pick up the resident from school on Monday and from the local BART station on Tuesday. Additionally, during that week, the care team noted that the resident had a wrapped ankle and had expressed that it had been hurting for a while. The care team asked the facility management about this, and management staff stated that there was no communication to staff about an ankle injury. However, review of the facility shift notes reveal that there was an entry on January 21, 2023 about the resident having leg pain, and the staff member requested that the facility schedule an appointment for the resident to make sure the resident did not sustain a sprain. However, the resident was not taken to see a physician, and the facility could not supply evidence of a medical visit for the resident regarding the matter. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be substantiated.

Per the IR, staff confiscated a resident's birth control medication (a plan b pill and condoms). During a visit to the facility on 9/12/23, Administrator confirmed that the medication had not been returned to the resident. During today's visit, Administrator further explained that the medication was a single pill not in any packaging, so staff were not sure if the medication was actually birth control. Administrator stated the resident has not asked for the medication and that if the resident were to ask, the facility would take the resident to the doctor to get the requested medication. The condoms had been returned to the resident the day of the incident. LPA advises that since one of residents' personal rights is to have access to birth control medication, if staff confiscated the pill due to not being sure it was birth control, and if the condoms were returned to the resident, these details should be included in the incident report.

LPA met with Administrator Tracy McWoodson and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation at the facility, LPA observed that there was some evidence that staff may be on their phones during their shifts, particularly if providing supervision upstairs, that staff may be working past their shift and paid hours, and that staff may not be assisting residents with accessing therapeutic services or activities, specifically requested outings to the gym, which would go against the facility policy that residents are able to request to go to the gym and be taken so long as other facility operations are not disrupted. While it could not be proven these were widespread violations or that the facility was out of operation, LPA advises as best practice that staff be trained on the following relevant sections: Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) sections 87065.2, subsections (a), (b)(1), and (b)(6). See the three LIC 9102s attached.

LPA conducted confidential resident and staff interviews and reviewed resident and staff files. LPA observed resident and staff files to be complete, except for the items discussed below. During review of incident reports, LPA observed an incident in which staff handling of a situation may have contributed to two residents running away from placement. LPA discussed the incident and planned follow-up with the staff members with the Administrator. LPA reviewed the involved staff members' files. LPA observed that staff S1's (See LIC Confidential Names dated 2/1/24) personnel file did not include the staff member's initial training record. Therefore, LPA was unable to verify that S1 had completed the necessary initial training in order to be left alone with residents and to be counted toward the staff to child ratio. The documents were requested, and the licensee was unable to supply on this day, so LPA was not able to verify the documents reflected the necessary hours.

This inspection is a continuation of the inspection that began on May 21, 2024, at 10: AM. LPA Belfield and Aparicio met with Administrator Tracy McWoodson who assisted with the inspection. During the previous inspection, LPA Belfield and LPA Aparicio met with Executive Director Assistant LaTonya Harper. Staff and client file reviews and interviews were conducted. During the client file review of the initial inspection, LPAs observed no documentation indicating the child has been participating or offered the opportunity to participate in the development of their Needs and Services Plan (NSP), and NSP not being updated every 30 days from the date the child was placed in the facility in three of the three client files. Additionally, LPAs observed no child and authorized representative signatures available on the NSP in three of the three client files. During today's inspection LPAs conducted a walk through of the facility, photos were taken during the walkthrough, reviewed client Psychotropic Administration Records (PMAR), reviewed Centrally Stored Medication Log (LIC622), and LPA's observed administrator conduct a pill count for each client. Based on observations made during the pill count and psychotropic medication documentation review, LPAs determined the following: the centrally stored medication log for each psychotropic medication is not properly documented to include the correct pill counts and number of refills prescribed; the document prescription numbers on the PMAR's and centrally stored log were incorrect for one of three clients files; Psychotropic medication was logged on a PRN form instead of the PMAR.

(See LIC Confidential Names List). LPA provided technical support in the form of an advisory for staff to set limits for behavior that are consistent with trauma - informed care standards. See LIC Technical Assistance. During the discussion, Facility Administrator indicated that staff regularly receive training around trauma informed care and staff are encouraged to swap places when handling an escalated resident. Facility Administrator added that they have checked in with S1 regarding trauma informed practices while identifying areas of improvement. LPA advised that Facility Administrator maintains this type of conversation and training with their staff. LPA obtained documentation of supervision check in between facility administrator and S1.

Safety precautions were taken including screening call and mask-wearing. The Inspection Tool was used to conduct the inspection. There are two residents in care. LPA interviewed present residents and staff. The facility is maintained at a comfortable temperature, and hot water at the upstairs resident bathroom measured within permitted range, at 111. F. The facility, per the tool, was in compliance in all areas other than those listed below, for which citations or advisories were issued. 1. Staff Ratios. During visit, two residents returned home, and there was only one staff (Administrator), and no additional staff showed at their arrival. LPA issued an advisory of STRTP Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87065.5(b)(1). 2. Staff Ratios. The current LIC Personnel Report indicates there is one overnight staff who works 12AM-8AM Monday through Friday and one overnight staff who works 12AM-8AM Saturday and Sunday. LPA issued a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87065.5(b)(2). 3. Needs and Services. Residents records contained needs and services plans that were not being updated every 30 days. R1's (See LIC Confidential Names, dated 10/7/21) plan was dated 5/28/21 and had a \"re-evaluate\" date of 7/21/21, and R2's plan was dated 8/22/21 and had a \"re-evaluate\" date of 11/22/21. LPA issued a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87068.3(a). 4. Smoking on Site. During tour of facility, LPA observed 10+ cigarette butts in the back and side yards. Per Administrator, staff are aware that residents are smoking in their rooms and throwing the cigarette butts out of the window. Staff are doing contraband checks, but cigarette butts have not been removed from grounds. LPA issued a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87087(c). 5. First Aid Certificates. LPA observed that 5 of 10 staff files reviewed [Refer to LIC Confidential Names for staff names] did not include a valid/current first aid certificate. LPA issued a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87065.1(c)(6)(A). 6. Staff Training. LPA observed that 9 of 10 staff files [Refer to LIC Confidential Names for staff names] did not contain training documentation. Some staff were missing all staff training and had no training record in the training binder. Some staff had the initial training log completely signed off. Staff work at multiple facilities, and LPA has prior knowledge that some staff have completed initial training based on copies of their files at other locations. However, the training records in the staff files at this site would indicate that less than 15 hours of training were completed in 2020. Additionally, there is a training record in staff files that indicates 20 hours were completed in 2021, completed over two days, with 10 hours done each day. The dates are 1/12/21 and 3/30/21. Per Asst. Director La Tanya Harper, these dates are the completion dates for mulitple days long training courses. There is no training material for this training in the record, breakdown of time spent on each topic or how the hours were calculated, nor a certificate. LPA issued a citation of STRTP ILS Section 87066(b)(4). 7. Bedroom Sharing Arrangement. LPA observed that the resident records do not contain documentation of the bedroom sharing arrangements. LPA issued an advisory per STRTP ILS Section 87087(e). 8. Condition of Site & Grounds. LPA observed minor damages, including a cracked microwave door, two fist sized holes (one in bedroom, one in upstairs hall), and cracked/punched doors to two bedrooms. Damages do not appear to cause an immediate risk, and all items are functioning. Administrator showed LPA a list of items, including these damages, that have been sent to the director for repairs but have not yet been repaired. Per Administrator, the licensee is taking steps to address these damages. The facility is otherwise in good condition. Additionally, LPA observed two bent and broken window screens in the side yard. Per Administrator, residents break these off of the windows in order to throw cigarette butts out. LPA observed the screens had not been removed from the side yard. The screens are made of metal, which can be bent and worked into a dangerous item. The screens also are in the walkway, and while light in weight, they are large and could obstruct the passageway in an emergency. LPA issued an advisory per STRTP ILS Section 80087(a). 9. Health Screenings. Two staff files were missing health screening with TB test. LPA issued an advisory of STRTP ILS Section 80066(a)(10). One staff does not work on site at this location. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report was left with Administrator Maurice Jones, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

Administrator confirmed that the report was accurate and that there was only one staff on shift. LPA discussed the ratio requirement for facilities with a capacity of 7 or more, which applies even when the facility census is 6 or below. LPA also discussed that the licensee should continue to provide hiring updates but that the ratio requirements must be followed following this incident to ensure compliance. Lastly, LPA discussed the process of reducing the capacity, since the facility does not typically go over 6 residents, and doing so would make the ratio requirement for this facility the same as that for the licensee's other facilities.

The purpose of the inspection was to complete the continuation inspection for STRTP annual inspection that was initiated on October 05, 2021. LPA's already completed the physical inspection, staff records, and staff interviews of the facility. During this annual inspection continuation LPAs interviewed four of the six clients to ensure the STRTP are meeting the Title Regulations and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS), see LIC 811 dated 11/10/21. The client interviews are located under the LIC 809 dated 10/22/21. Based on interview with clients, there was some confusion over the \"point system\" used that determines the amount of cash a client can keep on them physically, but the amount that is deposited into their savings does not change. In-addition, there was some concern over the food menu; however, it was noted that staff allows for the clients to give suggestions and they will do their best to accommodate them. The STRTP appears to be meeting Core Services/Supports requirements. Due to only the physical plant, and client interviews being completed this inspection will be continued at a later date. No deficiencies were found during this inspection. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the residential manager Anne Lacy.",

Confidential interviews reported that C1 would take the facility's house phone, hide it in their room, and keep it for personal use.

Confidential interviews revealed when C1 was on hold of the facility house phone, and if C2 and C3 requested to use the phone, staff would allow them to use the staff phone for their calls.

(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, June 22, 2023.) The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma- informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Carrillo and LPM King observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Corina Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

    "narrative": "On June 29, 2021, at 9: AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carmen Escobar arrived at Maywright Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP). The purpose of the inspection was to complete the continuation inspection for STRTP annual inspection that was initiated on June 28, 2021. LPA already completed the physical inspection of the facility and reviewed facility client files on the first day of the annual inspection. During this annual inspection continuation, LPA Escobar reviewed ten personnel files to ensure they contained all required documentation per Title Regulations and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS). Personnel Files are usually maintained in a locked closet inside the staff office. All appropriate personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. Eight of the ten files that were reviewed were for employees who converted from group home personnel to STRTP personnel. LPA observed the converted staff members were trained according to the STRTP training requirements for employees. File for staff 1 (S1) did not have current job evaluation. Nine of the ten staff files did not have not have employer verification forms in files. Technical advisories will be issued for the aforementioned staff file issues. Administrator Jerome Jordan states he has been the current administrator since 2018 at the facility, however, no documents or requests for administrator change were made to Community Care Licensing (CCL). Incorrect administrator remains on file. Per interviews conducted, the present administrator is not at the facility as required.

Administrator Jerome Jordan is present at the facility a minimum of 20 hours a week, as verified by staff schedule and interviews. Appropriate staff/client ratios were verified during this inspection. LPA discussed the following with the Administrator and Facility Manager: incident reporting, including incidents related to Assembly Bill 388 law enforcement contacts as well as incidents involving emergency interventions. LPA discussed procedures for Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings, including an overview of required Core Services and Supports. On this second day of the continued annual inspection, two youth counselors (direct care staff), one Case Manager, one Facility Manager, and Facility Administrator, were present and were interviewed in regard to their job duties, training, and services provided at the facility. All staff were able to provide sufficient information in relation to the facility's STRTP program. Staff have no issues or concerns regarding the facility. Based upon the inspection of facility records and interviews with staff and clients, the Licensee appears to be meeting CFT and Core Services/Supports requirements. LPA requested the recent board meeting minutes be provided via email by July 6, 2021. LPA also requested an updated LIC500 be sent to LPA as soon as possible.

    "narrative": "not receiving therapeutic services as required, and C1 is not attending school regularly. Specifically, it was reported the STRTP lacks supervision for clients as clients are allowed to stay out past PM. It was also reported C1 is not receiving therapeutic services due to therapist availability issues and facility never notified C1's CSW of this. It was also reported that C1 did not attend school for a month. Several witnesses corroborate that therapeutic services were minimized due to service providers having COVID19 and also STRTP clients declining services. Facility provided LPA verification of mental health treatment service logs which demonstrate weekly services provided to C1 or C1 declining services. Staff confirmed therapist was out with COVID19 on occasion but provided LPA information about staff-led \"groups\" that were provided to clients in the meanwhile. Finally, staff confirmed C1 was not in school for almost three months, however, facility provided emails from school district corroborating efforts being made to enroll C1 in school, however, the facility had to wait for a school to accept C1 as several had denied enrollment. Several confidential interviews corroborate the allegations are \"not true\" and corroborate that staff are always supervising clients in the home and some clients are approved by their county social workers to take community walks that can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on the client. Facility confirms the clients are not generally out past PM, but on occasion, clients may return late. Facility provided LPA with corroborating documentation of this information. Facility took action in each of the allegations reported and followed standard protocol. While a witness maintains these allegations occurred, the majority of all confidential interviews corroborate the information provided by facility. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that staff do not provide adequate supervision, C1 is not receiving therapeutic services as required, and C1 is not attending school regularly, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. The allegations are, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited.

    "narrative": "before being enrolled in school, C1 is constantly late to school, and facility is non-responsive to school regarding C1. Specifically, it was reported that C1 is late for school almost on a daily basis. When addressed with C1, it was reported C1 is late to school due to staff being late each morning during shift change. Additionally, C1 was at the facility for over a month before being enrolled in school. Staff confirmed C1 was not in school for about a month, however, facility provided emails from school district corroborating efforts being made to enroll C1 in school. The facility had to wait for a school to accept C1 as several had denied enrollment. Finally, it was also reported a confidential witness has reached out to the facility \"time after time\" regarding C1's school attendance and school concerns and the facility has not called back or made any effort to communicate with involved party. While a witness maintains this occurs, all other witnesses corroborate clients, including C1, are not late to school because of staff, rather, are late because clients refuse to wake up for school. Several witnesses corroborate staff will provide verbal direction for clients to get up, however, clients refused to get up for school. Facility provided LPA with corroborating documentation of this information in the daily log. Finally, while a witness maintains staff has made no effort to be in communication with C1's school, the majority of all confidential interviews corroborate the facility took a few weeks to get into the habit of being in constant communication with schools, however, once facility began with more communication, the facility has stayed on top of everything and make a constant effort to update schools and county social workers if anything comes up or needs to be addressed regarding clients. Several confidential witnesses confirm the facility is \"doing what it needs to do\" for clients in their care. The confidential witnesses corroborate they do not like to get up for school and neither did C1 at the time; this always made clients late to school. Other witnesses maintain the facility did not communicate well at first, but within a few weeks, had everything together and have been doing a great job since then regarding client communication with both schools and CSWs. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that C1 was at facility for an extended period of time before being enrolled in school, C1 is constantly late to school, and facility is non-responsive to school regarding C1, may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "The incident report also reported that C1 had no adverse side effects from the medication. Confidential interviews reported that the STRTP's medication protocol requires staff to give clients medication in the staff office. Before giving the medication, staff check the labels to ensure they have the right medication and verify the client's identity. Staff will then place the medicine in a cup to be given to the client and complete the Psychotropic Medication Administration Record (MAR). Corroborating confidential interviews admitted the incident took place and reported that S2 did not follow the STRTP's medication procedure. A Confidential interview reported that S2 failed to follow the procedure because they (S2) felt \"rushed\" and gave C1 the medication in the bedroom without verifying the medication was being given to the correct client. During the health and safety inspection, LPA was provided with C1's MAR, and the medication error was documented. However, the staff signature and initials were missing. LPA also observed all medications were centrally stored inside a locked box in the living room closet. All medication was observed to be in their original bottle, with labels unaltered, and stored separately in zip lock bags. Additional documentation provided to LPA shows staff received retraining on medication management on 02/13/2024. Furthermore, a confidential interview reported that S2 has not administered medication since the incident, and the staff was instructed to give the client medications in the staff office, according to the STRTP's standard procedure. Based on confidential interviews and a review of pertinent documents, the allegation that staff (S2) mismanaged a child's (C1) medication is substantiated. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The STRTP is cited with a violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 87075(a)(c) Health Related Services (a) In addition to California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80075, the following shall apply (c) Psychotropic medications shall be used only in accordance with the written directions of the physician prescribing the medication...

The purpose of the inspection was to deliver the findings for the below incident reported via Special Incident Report (SIR). According to the SIR, on 3/19/20, Child Ref #1 (C1) (see Confidential Names form LIC811 dated 3/16/21) was horse playing with his peers outside of Kiwanis Cottage and then C1 began insulting staff and striking the Cottage windows with his fists. After several redirects from Staff Ref#1 (S1) C1 began to walk away from the Cottage. C1 then quickly made a turn saying, \"you thought\" and returned towards the cottage kicking the door. C1 then walked away towards the recreation center and returned near his cottage and dismantled a yellow mop bucket top wringer and approached Kiwanis cottage. S1 counseled C1 to make positive choices. As C1 approached Kiwanis cottage, Staff #2 (S2) witnessed C1 attempting to throw the mop at Kiwanis' window. Thus, due to C1's escalating behavior, C1 was escorted (restrained) away from the area with S2 (Right) and S1 (Left) at 1:12pm-1:14pm (both ProAct trained) to Gregory cottage. LPA Flores obtained copies from C1's files: Child and Family Team Meeting (CFT) copy report, Needs and Services Plan, Placement Agreement, Restraint Debriefing Form and Discharge Summary. The documentation reviewed revealed that C1 was transitioned to a standing restraint from 1:14pm to 1:15pm with S1 and S2 remaining in their positions. C1 continued to threaten staff and attempted to free himself from the restraint. C1 was transitioned to a floor assisted restraint with staff remaining in their positions and Staff Ref#3 (S3) securing C1's legs (also ProAct trained) from 1:15PM - 1:24PM (9 minutes). S1 offered deep breathing coping skills for C1 to practice deescalating. cont.# C1 began to take deep breaths and informed staff he was ready to comply with instructions. C1 was then asked to have a seat on the couch to take space and wait for Nurse Genevieve Andrade, to follow up with him. STRTP Management team was updated. The agency nurse conducted the medical assessment of C1. On 3/26/20, a CFT meeting was conducted and C1 agreed to growth in the following areas: provoking, instigating, substance use, fights with peers and how to use coping skills when bored. On 9/10/20, C1 transitioned to the care of his biological mother. No further inspection is needed at this time. A copy of this report and LIC811 was provided to the facility representative.

Additionally, Krysti reported that she did not immediately report this interaction because she was a distance away, and being dark and hard to see exactly what happened. On 1/10/20, Deputy Romero of the LA County Sheriff's Department, San Dimas Station, arrived at the treatment facility to investigate the allegation made by C1 regarding S1. Deputy Romero interviewed other children and informed to Talesha Payne that none of the children witnessed C1 being punched by S1. Deputy Romero informed Talesha Payne that some of the children stated that other children were attempting to blackmail S1 for money by making allegations. Talesha Payne informed Deputy Romero that C1 was discharged from the STRTP and is currently on a psychiatric hold at a hospital where he is scheduled to be discharged from there within the hour. Deputy Romero stated that he will contact Ms. Payne after speaking with C1 and S1. In afternoon of 1/10/20, Deputy Romero contacted Talesha Payne and informed her that during his interview with C1 he stated that on 12/30/2019, he was highly intoxicated on Vodka and did not recall S1 punching him in the eye. # C1 stated that while on runaway status with another child, he was smoking and drinking, and the other child was involved in an altercation. Deputy Romero reported that he followed up by asking C1 why he was currently in the hospital, and C1 stated that he got drunk and made statements that he wanted to kill himself. Deputy Romero asked C1 if he was still suicidal and C1 stated that he was never suicidal, he just wanted his social worker to move his placement. After Deputy Romero talked with C1, Deputy Romero contacted S1 who denied being physically aggressive towards C1. On 01/29/2020, S1 was terminated from the STRTP. An Advisory Note / Technical Violation was issued. No further inspection is needed at this time. A copy of this report, LIC811 and LIC9201 was provided to the STRTP representative.

    "narrative": "On 05/05/2021, the Department received a complaint alleging that staff did not prevent youth from AWOL's. LPA conducted interviews with four (4) staff whom witnessed the event and three (3) youths. Staff denied the allegation. Based on interviews conducted with staff it was revealed that multiple youth ran away on 04/27/21 and staff did try to prevent youth from leaving the facility by counseling youth not to leave and by following them off campus until they lost visual. Also, that staff does not use physical restraints on the youth when they ran away from the facility. Based on interviews conducted with youth it was revealed by two youths that staff did try to prevent youth from leaving the facility; however, one youth stated that staff did not try to stop youth from leaving. Based on conflicting statements this allegation could not be corroborated. It was alleged that staff did not prevent self-harming behavior while minor was in care. The facility staff denied the allegation. Based on interviews conducted with staff whom witnessed this incident it was revealed that on 04/28/21 during a meeting with staff the youth grabbed a pair of scissors, ran out of the office and left the facility. Interviews revealed that staff followed behind youth and alerted the San Dimas Sheriff's Department about youth making self-harming statements and having in possession a pair of scissors. Consequently, the youth was found by the San Dimas Sheriff's Department and was hospitalized and placed on a psychiatric hold for making self-harming statements. LPA interviewed the placement agency social worker whom indicated that the incident was reported timely and did not have any safety concerns with facility staff. Based on interviews conducted, one youth stated that staff did not try to prevent youth from self-harming and the other two youth disclosed that staff did call the police to report the youth had a pair of scissors. Based on conflicting statements this allegation could not be corroborated. It was alleged that staff made inappropriate comments towards minor. The facility staff denied this allegation. Based on interviews conducted with staff whom were present it was revealed that no one witnessed or heard a staff make inappropriate comments towards minor in care. It was revealed by youth that inappropriate comments were made by staff on 04/28/21 but that no one else witnessed it. Based on interviews conducted with youths it was revealed that one is affirming inappropriate comments were made and the other two denied witnessing or having heard any staff make inappropriate comments. Throughout, the interviews LPA observed conflicting statements regarding this allegation and was unable to corroborate whether the allegation was true. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the above allegation{s} did or did not happen, therefore, the above allegations are being closed UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Staff Danielle Chiong shadowed C1 and opened the hallway door. C1 then exited his room with a clenched fist and walked in the direction of the child's room (from the previous incident). Staff Clarissa Sanchez stood in front of C1 as a precautionary measure. C1 then began to push a bench in the direction of Staff Jun Wei-Kao, but Staff Jun Wei-Kao was able to evade. Staff Clarissa Sanchez fresh-faced with Staff Jun Wei-Kao and asked C1 if he would like to take space outside with staff. C1 declined and continued to try to get to the other child. Due to C1 increased aggression, he was placed in a moving restraint with Staff Clarissa Sanchez left side and Wagner Contreras right side (Both ProAct trained) from approximately 5:18PM- 5:19PM (duration one minute).

The investigation revealed that two facility clients engaged in a sexual interaction behind stage curtains in the recreational building while under the supervision of a facility staff. The sexual activity was discovered by another facility client who reported it to the staff. By the time the staff walked up to the stage area, both clients were securing their pants. The client who reported the incident to staff refused to make any statements to Investigator Spindola, but the staff told Investigator Spindola that the client told him that the two clients were having a sexual encounter behind the stage curtains. Confidential statements obtained from one of the facility clients indicated that the sexual abuse occurred, and he screamed for help during the incident but the staff was not in the immediate vicinity according to the client. The biological parent of the other client did not want her child interviewed regarding the allegation. Based on the fact that the facility staff allowed the clients to play behind a closed curtain for an undetermined amount of time, and the fact that this is the third similar incident that occurred in a couple of months, the allegation is substantiated.

The investigation revealed that while the client was speaking with his mother on the phone, another client engaged him in a verbal dispute that escalated into a physical altercation resulting in the client being pushed and falling to the ground sustaining an injury to his finger. Confidential statements obtained indicated that the client who sustained the injury was prone to engage in fights with other clients without provocation resulting in other clients retaliating against him, and some fights occur suddenly whereby staff are unable to prevent the fights due to the sudden nature.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that a facility client was sexually abused by another client at the facility due to neglect and lack of supervision. The investigation revealed that two facility clients engaged in a sexual interaction behind stage curtains in the recreational building while under the supervision of a facility staff. The sexual activity was discovered by another facility client who reported it to the staff. By the time the staff walked up to the stage area, both clients were securing their pants. The client who reported the incident to staff refused to make any statements to Investigator Spindola, but the staff told Investigator Spindola that the client told him that the two clients were having a sexual encounter behind the stage curtains. Confidential statements obtained from one of the facility clients indicated that the sexual abuse occurred, and he screamed for help during the incident but the staff was not in the immediate vicinity according to the client. The biological parent of the other client did not want her child interviewed regarding the allegation. Based on the fact that the facility staff allowed the clients to play behind a closed curtain for an undetermined amount of time, and the fact that this is the third similar incident that occurred in a couple of months, the allegation is substantiated. Based on the information gathered, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was met, therefore the allegation is substantiated per California Code of Regulations Title 22 - refer to LIC9099-D for deficiencies. Per the new Civil Penalty laws, Health and Safety (H&S) Code section 1548(E), an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) determination is pending due to the substantiated allegation. If an ECP is warranted, a Community Care Licensing (CCL) representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment. A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form, LIC 9099-D for deficiency and Appeal Rights were provided to the agency representative.",

The Program Director at the facility, including staff workers who were mentioned or identified in the referral denied the allegations that meals provided to clients are skipped and food is spoiled. Staff workers were consistent and stated that all meals and snacks are prepared daily in the primary kitchen, including cottages having their own refrigerator with access to other fresh foods and snacks. Staff reported that clients are not allowed to physically assault other clients and will take appropriate action to control client(s) behavior. Staff working denied that they will bully those clients that wish to file a grievance towards anyone and stated that they will assist those clients in completing the form. In confidential interviews, statements obtained could not corroborate the allegations reported. One client stated that was one incident (no date provided) when his meals were skipped but then stated that facility cottage provided him with other options to have his meal after returning late in the evening from school. Other clients stated that meals are being provided without being skipped. On the matter of food is old or spoiled, two clients reportedly observed some juices/drinks in the cottage refrigerator past their \"use by date\" for consumption, other clients had no concerns. It was reported that staff are allowing clients to bully their peers by placing them in a choke hold or headlock. The one focused client who was identified as the minor who uses choke holds and headlocks towards his peers admitted to playfully being rough using headlocks and not choke holds. The focused client admitted to bullying others in the past. One client disclosed that he once told a staff working that the focused client plays to rough. Other clients denied that the allegation and stated that everyone plays rough and defines this as \"horse playing\". All clients stated that staff will normally react quickly to clients when that misbehave or when they exhibit aggressive behavior with their peers. Clients also denied that a client was physically assaulted specifically on 09/06/2021 that resulted in having a bloody nose while playing on the water slide. The clients denied the allegation, one client who had a bloody nose stated that it was accident. The facility provided a copy of the special incident report (SIR). Clients denied that staff will bully those clients who file a grievance about their treatment. Individual identified as other who provided information about the allegations could not be contacted or located and therefore no statement was obtained. The county referral dated 09/06/2021 that is associated to this complaint investigation was not investigated by the county but was evaluated out for review. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. An exit interview was conducted and copy of this report was provided to the facility representative for review and signature. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

The purpose of the inspection was to deliver the findings for the below incident reported via Special Incident Report (SIR). The STRTP reported that on 5/25/2022, Child Ref #1 (C1) (see Confidential Names form LIC811 dated 06/21/2022) was restrained for 17 minutes. C1 needed medical assistant and was transported to a medical facility. LPA Flores investigated the incident and interviewed C1, School Support Services Dalton Drumm (DD), Lead Support Specialist Juan Morales (JM), Nurse Katherine Wolfe (KW) and Patricia White. A review of C1's file was conducted, and copies were made. The statements obtained, video surveillance and documentation reviewed revealed that on 05/25/2022, C1 was erratic and was mad because C1 could not to find a pair of shoes. After a while C1 walked inside the administration building at the Canyon View School and was told by DD that he could not be inside the building. cont.# C1 got close to DD and slapped DD's hands multiples times, while DD was evading C1, C1 lunged with a close fist towards C1 and began to chase DD through the hallway. LPA Flores observed in the video footage that C1 closed the glass door and did not allow DD to have access back into the building. DD continued telling C1 that he was not allowed to be inside the building, but C1 refused to leave the building. JM arrived to assist with the incident. While DD asked C1 to leave the building, C1 ran towards DD with two closed fists. C1 attempted to strike DD but he was unsuccessful due to DD evading. Due to C1's aggressive behavior, he was placed in standing restraint by DD and JM, and immediately transitioned into a 2-person floor restraint at 10:27AM, with DD on the right side and JM on the left side. Additional staff was requested to assist. Instructional Aide Miguel Mondragon (MM) arrived and assessed. C1 was placed in a 3-person floor restraint with MM securing the legs. Nurse KW was notified at approximately 10:29AM and arrived to assess C1 noting his speech to be incoherent, rapid, and pressured. During the interview, KW disclosed that she approved the continuation of the restraint after the initial 15 minutes. According to the SIR, C1's skin was cold and clammy to the touch and his pupils were observed as dilated. C1 began to bang the front of his head against the tile floor multiple times, stating \"Call 911\" and \"Help Me\" in-between times of incoherent speech. KW determined that C1 might be under the influence of a substance. cont.# Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were contacted at 10:33AM. C1 remained in a floor restraint until EMS arrived and took over care at 10:44 am. EMS transported C1 to a medical facility where C1 was assessed and vitals and blood work were taken. C1 notified the nurse of chest pain and had a hard time speaking to the doctor. When C1 was asked by medical personnel if he had thoughts of harming himself or others, C1 replied \"no\". At the hospital the nurse proceeded to take a urine sample, and traces of cannabis were found. C1 was cleared and discharged from the hospital. It was recommended for C1 to follow up with a psychiatrist. At 2:23PM, C1 returned to the STRTP, C1 got food and transitioned to his room. At the STRTP, C1 was close monitored by the STRTP staff. No further inspection is needed. No citation was issued. A copy of this report and LIC811 was provided to the facility representative. Exit interview conducted.",

    "narrative": "Page The Department received a complaint alleging clients in placement engaged in sexual acts while at the facility. The investigation revealed two clients left a scheduled swimming activity and began wandering around the facility, unsupervised by staff. Later that day, clients were observed behind a cottage by staff and, when asked what they were doing, disclosed they attempted to engage in consensual sexual acts. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted revealed the clients attempted sexual acts three times, throughout the facility. Per the facility incident report, the clients are observed on video without staff supervision for approximately twenty-two (22) minutes. There is a total of eight (8) non-consecutive minutes where video visual of youth is lost. The incident report states the clients are first observed at 2: PM walking towards the dining hall. However, information gathered from confidential interviews conducted revealed the initial incident occurred in the restroom near the swimming pool while the swimming activity was taking place, indicating the clients were unsupervised prior to what is observed via video footage. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted revealed youth are knowledgeable of camera locations on campus and, capable of evading them if necessary. Records obtained during the investigation revealed two staff were issued written warnings due to the incident. The written warnings state the staff failed to follow facility supervision protocol resulting in minors engaging in inappropriate acts. Based on information gathered from interviews conducted and record review the allegation is substantiated, the standard of the preponderance of evidence has been met. The facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Article 06 87065.2(b)(1) Personnel Duties. Record review and information obtained from interviews conducted confirm two clients engaged in sexual acts due to lack of staff supervision. Exit interview conducted.

LPA asked Ms. Smith why the minor's bicycle was locked. Ms. Smith explained that the minor requested the lock for his bicycle because the other residents in the home would use it and leave without permission on his bicycle. The facility staff purchased a lock for the minor. On June 26, 2022, the minor was upset and wanted to leave the facility without permission. The minor broke the lock off and did leave the facility. LPA asked Ms. Smith why would the minor have to break the lock off if he has the keys. Ms. Smith explained that the minors in the home do not keep their own keys. When they want their keys they request it from staff and staff will get it for them. LPA asked Ms. Smith if the bicycle was locked to prevent minor from leaving the facility without permission. Ms. Smith stated that the minor locks his own bicycle so others don't take it. They did not lock it up to prevent him from leaving the facility. On the day of the incident, minor was upset and didn't wait for the key and broke the lock off and then left. Ms. Smith explained to the LPA that staff is aware that they are not to lock up minor's personal belongings without their permission unless it is something they are not allowed to have in the home (contraband). There were no deficiencies cited during this Case Management for the incident of June 26, 2022",

Mr. Smith contacted Facility Manager, Nadia Smith which arrived at the facility shortly thereafter. The purpose for the inspection is to conduct a Case Management with regards to incident reports dated May 13, 2023 and May 14, 2023. Incident report dated May 13, 2023 stated that minor refused to take medication and lost points due to this. This incident report was also not signed by facility personnel. This incident report in question was vague with details and specifically stated that the minor lost points for not taking medication. Mr. Smith stated that he is the staff that is responsible for completing and submitting incident reports for the facility. Mr. Smith explained that he did not complete the incident reports in question as he was off on vacation during that time. Mr. Smith stated that the facility does not take away points for not taking medication and is not sure why that was put in the report. Ms. Smith stated that while Mr. Smith was out on vacation another staff completed the report. Ms. Smith agreed that this incident report was not properly completed with information and that clarification should had been stated that the loss of points was due to the disrespect (Inappropriate language) to staff and not because of not taking medication. Incident report dated May 14, 2023 was vague and lacked information for a complete incident report. AWOL protocols were followed but that was not conveyed in the report due to the incompleteness of the report. Ms. Smith also acknowledged that the reports were not signed and not reviewed before being submitted to Community Care Licensing. Ms. Smith stated that all staff will undergo re-training on incident report writing. An Advisory Note -Technical Violation was issued on this date, no deficiencies cited during this inspection.",

(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, March 19, 2024.) The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma- informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Carrillo observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Nadia Smith.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced annual continuation inspection at the Administrative Office located at Georgia St., Vallejo, CA 94590 and met with Administrator Steve Dogan, who assisted with the inspection. LPA received 2022Q2 and 2022Q Board Meeting Minutes. In the meeting minutes for both meetings, discussed was a new facility for this Licensee called the Haflinger house. LPA ensured that Administrator understood that no clients may reside at this residence until their program statement and application have been reviewed and approved. There has been no application submitted as of this time. Administrator understood and agreed that no children will reside at that house until their program has submitted the application, it has been approved, and a license has been issued. LPA reviewed four client files and five staff files, including one Administrator's, one Social Worker's, and one Facility Manager's files. LPA found that only one staff and the Administrator are acting as Facility Managers at this time, leaving the facility at times without a Facility Manager. Both the staff and Administrator have taken the Administrator's Certification course, and the staff also took an eight hour Facility Manager training course. The records were in compliance for the majority, however a few things were missing: one client out of four did not have record of a TB test being evaluated for or being given in their last medical exam. All clients that share rooms have a compatibility assessment as required however, they are based only on one child and their wants; they do not discuss/evaluate compatibility between two specific clients as required. LPA and Administrator went to the facility to review medications and medication records. All medications and medication records were in compliance. On this date, the facility is being cited for a violation of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Section 87065(f). Two Technical Violation Advisory Notes, which are not citations, were issued as well. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was left with him.",

The reason giving was \"the kids should have been in bed at that time and weren't'. C1 also disclosed during a confidential interview that the electricity to the whole house had been turned off. A client interviewed during an Annual Inspection, disclosed the same when asked about the electricity being turned off. There was also a video sent by C1's Case Manger confirming the electricity was turned off as well. It was also confirmed by clients and staff that the electricity to the outlet plugs in the kitchen are turned off. This is to prevent clients from charging their cell phones. Clients sign a contract that they will not have a personal cell phone until they reach a certain level. This is not in the Program Statement or addressed in their Needs and Service Plans. However, C1's cell phone was not taken by staff and remained in C1's possession. There is a phone in the house, that all clients can use to call social worker, lawyers and for their own personal use.

    "narrative": "Allegation: Staff locked minors out of facility for an extended period of time. It was determined during the investigation that C1 was not locked out of the house for an extended period. The incident was discussed in C1's latest, CFT Meeting. The County Supervising Social Worker stated the incident was embellished and C1 was not locked outside. This discussion occurred in the presence of C1. The Supervising Social Worker was present during the meeting and stated that she talked to C1 outside the home and stated C1 could of went back in the home as well. C1 felt he was locked out due to staff wanted C1 to turn in C1's cell phone. However, C1 did keep his phone and came inside the home after returning from an AWOL. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Allegation: Staff did not provide food and water to minor. It was determined during confidential interviews with Direct Care Staff and Behavioral Specialist staff that C1 was offered food/water when C1 was outside the home. The County Supervising Social Worker was on the phone when C1 was ordering food from Panera Bread. C1 choose to leave the home and get food from Panera Bread. All clients interviewed stated there was food in the home and available when they wanted to eat. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. Allegation: Staff did not allow minor to use bathroom. It was determined during interviews with clients and staff that C1 could have entered the home to use the bathroom. Staff and clients stated during interviews they could use the restroom whenever they wanted. During C1's interview he never stated C1 could not use the bathroom while outside.

Interviews with one client revealed that S1 and C1 would often be together in areas of the facility which cameras do not reach, and which are restricted to staff-only, such as the medication room and the laundry room. One staff interviewed stated that S1 did spend time in the laundry room to take breaks. Also revealed in the client's interview was that C1 would make inappropriate gestures about S1, such as a, \"butt-smacking,\" gesture, and described S1 and C1's relationship as, \"weird.\" There were no disclosures from anyone interviewed that there was a sexual or romantic relationship between S1 and C1.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility and met with Behavioral Tech Manager Robert Smith and Facility Manager Steven Anderson, who assisted with the inspection. The purpose of this CM is to close the Case Management opened on 4/5/2024. The incident that occurred on 1/25/2024 involved staff from Mile High conducting a restraint on a child in placement at a Resource Family Home (RFH). It was alleged the restraint was conducted inappropriately, and that matter has since been referred to Solano County for investigation, as the RFH is licensed by them. LPA investigated the incident to determine how Mile High/MSK Solutions is involved in the RFH, and where the two blend together. LPA conducted this case management investigation by conducting confidential interviews with one child, one staff, the Program Director, The Executive Director, the Facility Manager, an individual associated with Mile High (P1) on 4/5/2024, 4/10/2024, 4/15/2024, 4/19/2024, 5/7/2024, and 5/23/2024, and by reviewing Incident Reports relating to the incident from both Mile High and another agency who witnessed the incident. Through investigation, LPA was informed by P1 that they are not a staff at the Mile High Mountain Top house or Legend house, but is the Executive Director's personal assistant. However, before LPA was informed of this, LPA requested P1's schedule for when they are working at the Mile High houses from the FM, who informed LPA that P1 is only scheduled at, \"the Ranch,\" and that, \"that's what [their] timesheets say.\" LPA requested these timesheets, however when the Director responded, LPA was informed by the Director that P1 is paid privately by him, and not through Mile High; LPA did not receive any timesheets. P1 is associated to both Mile High houses, beginning in 2021. Both the FM and P1 explained to LPA how the incident and restraint occurred. This explanation was in contrast to what was reported by witnesses. LPA was informed that the Facility Manager was called to assist P1 at the Resource Home in containing the youth in care due to the rapport FM already has with the youth, and FM responded, assisting with the restraint and de-escalation. LPA was informed by one staff, that staff from Mile High go to that Resource Home, \"every week or every day,\" \"multiple staff, a few staff from Legend house...morning shift and evening shift people.\" However the staff did not remember any staff names. When asked if staff leave their shift at Mile High to assist at the RFH, the staff confirmed they do and depending on C1's behaviors, they would be gone for about a couple of hours. The staff referred to the RFH as, \"the Ranch.\" LPA learned from ED that MSK Solutions, the Licensee of Mile High homes, has another property called, \"the Ranch.\" MSK Solutions had previously submitted intention to license that location as a facility with CCL on 10/11/2023, however then rescinded that request on 10/24/2023. LPA has visited the location and found that it is marked by a driveway arch that states, \"Mile High Sky Ranch.\" LPA was informed that the Director lives there and it is licensed through Solano County as a Resource Family Home, where a previous client of Mile High is placed. ED informed LPA that the Director rents the home from ED, however it is not related to Mile High/MSK. LPA also learned that the clients at the Mile High houses sometimes visit the RFH to tend to the animals there. FM provided LPA with his timesheet from January 2024, obtained from a time tracking app the facility uses called a uAttend, as well as the LIC500s (Personnel Reports). FM also showed LPA the Line App which the staff and management use to communicate, and the Paychex app, which keeps staff paychecks. An office meeting will be scheduled with MSK Solutions at a future date to obtain more information regarding facility staff involvement at the RFH. An exit interview was conducted with Facility Manager Steven Anderson and a copy of this report was provided to FM.",

LPAs conducted a walk through of the facility with staff and Administrator. LPAs observed: three client bedrooms, two pantries, one hall closet, one kitchen, two living rooms, a staff office/therapy office space, the backyard, a laundry room, and the garage. The client bathroom did not have paper towels/towels. There was no sign posted denoting the hot water for the coffee maker. The floors and surfaces throughout the facility were sticky. The area above the stove on the cabinets and ceiling had crease/grime. The facility had a limited variety of non-perishable food for 7 days for 5 clients. LPA advised to obtain more variant non-perishable foods. There was a low amount of fresh vegetables. Two of the client dressers were in disrepair. The medication was inaccessible as required. The hot water measured at 112.4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within the required temperature range of 105-120. There was a working carbon monoxide detector. LPA's inspected the facility van and saw that it was in working condition with fair tires, no problem indicator lights, and working seat belts. The first aid kit was present and had all required elements. LPA Areizaga took photos of facility on state-issued cellphone. LPA interviewed two clients. The facility has a client register as required, however it needed to be updated as they recently got a new client in the house. Client cash resources/records were inaccessible as required. There was no planned activity schedule. The items planned on the menu were not present in the facility in these cases: Today lunch planned was salad with grilled chicken. However, there was only one small romaine heart and the chicken was still frozen, for tomorrow: no bagels were present in the house, and no ramen, which was planned for tomorrow's lunch. For Thursday there was no pancake mix, which was scheduled. One staff mentioned having PB&J sandwiches planned, however there was no bread. FM stated that he would be going shopping right now and the usual staff who buys the food was off. Client cash resources are maintained in a binder, kept locked in a closet. One client's allowance was incorrectly documented as having had no previous balance, then was issued $20 on 4/4/2025, marked as withdrawn $20, and then marked as having a $20 balance. However, there was no $20 in the binder. Admin stated the record was incorrect and should be a $0 balance. Administrator will have the record corrected and the client re-sign for the correct amount when they return from school on today's date. The Board meets quarterly as required. LPAs could not complete the inspection on this date, and will return on another date to complete the annual inspection. On this date, the facility is being cited for violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Section 80087(a). Technical Violation Advisory Notes, which are not citations, were also issued. Additionally, LPA provided Administrator with the letters of revisions needed for Mile High's Program Statement and Plan of Operation update. The due date for revisions is 5/21/2025, and LPA scheduled a date to meet with the agency with Administrator Steven Anderson to go over any questions they have, for 4/21/2025 at 10: AM.

    "narrative": "At 9: AM, Licensing Program Analysts (LPA) Alyssa Burgess and Orlando Areizaga made an unannounced annual continuation inspection at the facility's Administrative Office where their files are stored. No one answered the door and LPA called Administrator Steven Anderson, who stated he will be on his way. Later, LPAs checked the door again and Office Assistant Corri Collins answered, stating LPAs could not access the office, as there would be a meeting happening soon. LPA informed OA that they need to complete the annual and as the files are located at the office, they are there. OA informed LPA that a supervisor is not available, and LPAs may not use any place in the office. LPM Jodean Hall called Administrator to help facilitate the annual inspection. Administrator arrived and LPA provided him a list of all information needed to complete the annual. LPAs took a break to allow Administrator time to gather the documents and arrived at the Legend Home facility at 12: PM to continue the annual as agreed. At 12: PM Administrator arrived with the documents. LPA was provided the licensing documents retained for the past three years. The most recent report presented was dated 5/10/2023. The facility did not maintain Licensing Reports for the past three years as required. There was no manual restraint log. The facility is conducting disaster drills on a monthly basis, however does not conduct them at least once per shift, per six months. The Administrator brought staff files for staff from the Mountain Top house and needed to return to the Admin office to get Legend Home staff files. LPAs reviewed one Administrator file and one Clinician file. Once Administrator returned with the correct files, LPAs reviewed one Facility Manager file, and two staff files, finding: All staff are fingerprint cleared and associated as required. The Administrator and Clinician meet all requirements. The Clinician's (MH1) CPR/First expired 11/30/2024. On 4/7/2025 and today 4/8/2025 when LPAs arrived at the facility, S1 was the only staff present, who does not meet the education and experience requirements of a Facility Manager. There were no qualified Facility Managers present until Administrator arrived to assist. LPAs advised Administrator about the exception request process. All staff reviewed met the annual training requirements. LPAs reviewed four client files and found: The Needs and Services Plans (NSPs) did not include any information about clients having the need to be routinely searched. Through interviews and based on LPA observation, clients get searched with a metal detecting wand, and have their possessions searched, when they enter the facility as a standard practice. This is a violation of the clients' right to be free from unreasonable searches. The two clients observed to be searched (C1 and C2) on 4/7/2025, and C2 on 4/8/2025 had no indication in their NSP for the authorization of routine searches. Administrator stated C1 and C2 had no need to be wanded/searched. Administrator informed staff during this inspection. There was not a staff person designated to facilitate/plan the planned activities and there was no planned activities calendar. LPA was not provided a current record of mental health services provided to the clients for the past 12 months despite requesting one. A record of mental health services was provided to LPA on 3/7/2025 for an unrelated reason, and today, LPA was informed that is the record she should use, as directed by Interim Executive Director Jamek Johnson. The record shows that all clients have not received \"psycho therapy\" since the end of January 2025. LPA interviewed one staff and one Administrator on this date. LPA found they were knowledgeable about their roles and the clients. LPA advises for some refreshers on the mandated reporter process. One client's JV223 dated 6/24/2024 is expired. There is an email dated 5/8/2024 requesting review for renewal, however no other follow-up included in the file. Administrator is unsure if the client no longer takes psychotropic medications because they were refusing them, or because the JV223 expired. LPA issued an advisory note to inform LPA of the reason. On this date the facility is being cited for sections of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 5, Sections 87072(c)(10), 87065(f), and 87089.1(g) on the attached LIC809-Ds.

The water temperature measured at 111 degrees Fahrenheit which is within the required temperature range of 105 - 120 degrees Fahrenheit. LPAs observed an adequate amount of perishable and non-perishable foods. All bedrooms had adequate bedding and supplies. All lights were working. All poisons and disinfectants were locked and inaccessible. Medication was locked and inaccessible. Medication records showed that the Centrally Stored Medication and Destruction Records were out of date. All other regulations and requirements were met for medications. LPAs interviewed three clients. LPAs reviewed two client files.

This is a potential Health, Safety, or Personal Rights risk to clients in care. POC: By POC due date of 1/29/2024. The facility will have trained all eligible staff as facility managers, with the topics specified in section 87065.1(b)(5)(A-M) and will submit the monthly staff schedule for February 2024 with facility managers noted on all shifts with children, and will submit the training records. Administrator Steve Dogan sent LPA the POC during LPA's inspection. No further action is necessary. LPA advised Administrator to ensure that POCs are sent timely, by the POC due date, to prevent the assessment of civil penalties for the failure to correct. An exit interview was conducted with PD and a copy of this report and clearance letter were sent to Administrator Steve Dogan and PD.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility and met with Facility Manager (FM) Tom Hermann who assisted LPA with the inspection. CCL received an incident report dated 1/27/2024 stating that client C1 (see confidential names list dated 2/7/2024) went to C1's room and was yelling because C1's door was removed, \"as part of [C1's] suicidal watch.\" Earlier, C1 had barricaded in C1's room, so C1's door was removed. Staff intervened when C1 was yelling and C1 then did property destruction and threats. In another incident report dated 1/27/2024, it stated that earlier in the day, C1 was kicking a pool table, yelling at staff, and was attempting to harm themselves with a piece of plastic, which the staff was able to remove. LPA interviewed FM Tom Hermann and Administrator Steve Dogan. An emergency Child and Family Team Meeting was held on 2/5/2024 for C1. LPA reviewed CFT Notes and Action Plan and found they discussed placement. However, they did not discuss C1's safety in the facility, or any of the behavioral issues C1 has been displaying, C1's recent mental health struggles, or psychiatric hospitalizations. Program Director Reyes Bonilla will be requesting the next CFT be moved up sooner to be able to adequately address these issues. PD will inform LPA when this meeting is scheduled. After the meeting, the facility will send the notes to LPA. After investigation into these incidents LPA has found that while the intent behind removing the client's door was for safety, it is not clear that the steps to ensure it was not a personal rights violation were taken. LPA is issuing an advisory note, which is not a citation, to address this. Additionally, the incident report describing C1 attempting self-harm with a piece of plastic was limited in details to evaluate the danger of the plastic. LPA advised Administrator Steve Dogan to include more information in the incident report, such as where C1 was scratching with the plastic, what was the piece of plastic from, was it sharp, were there any marks on C1, etc. An exit interview was conducted with Program Director and a copy of this report was sent to Administrator Steve Dogan and PD.",

LPA, HPS, and Administrator conducted a walk through of the facility. LPA observed: three client bedrooms, one media/relaxation room, one dining room, kitchen, laundry area, garage, living room, three bathrooms, and staff office. Medications were inaccessible as required. Client Medication Administration Records were completed as required. There were separate Psychotropic Medication Administration Records for the psychotropic medications as required. There was an adequate amount of perishable and non-perishable food as required. The facility was clean. There was available foodware, in good condition. The hot water in the clients' bathroom measured at 143 degrees Fahrenheit, which is outside the required range of 105-120 degrees Fahrenheit. Clients had appropriate bedding and hygiene supplies. All clients had clothing as required. One client dresser was in disrepair with broken tracks/drawers. Outside in the backyard, there was an approximately 5 inch in diameter drain hole which was uncovered. There were no paper towels or soap in the media room bathroom. One seat out of eight passenger seats in the facility van had a broken/inoperable seat-belt buckle fastener. Disinfectants and knives were inaccessible to clients. LPA interviewed one staff. The staff was knowledgeable about the facility, however LPA recommends a refresher on mandated reporter requirements, and abuse reporting process. LPA and HPS went to the facility's administrative office located at Georgia Street, Vallejo, CA to conduct a file review and found: The board is meeting as required, and minutes are maintained. Board minutes were accessible to LPA. There are two clients placed currently, so the ratio is kept at 1:3, and staff are currently not conducting restraints unless another trained staff or Administrative staff come in to assist. LPA did observe the facility Pro-Act certified trainer's certification to be up-to-date. The facility plans to train additional staff on emergency interventions. All staff in the roster were fingerprint cleared and associated as required. All files were accessible to CCL as required. The client who is taking psychotropic medications had an accurate and updated JV223 as required. LPA was unable to complete the inspection and will return on another date to do so. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report was provided to him.",

LPA found this allegation to be unsubstantiated (see LIC9099 dated 5/6/2024 for the full report), however during LPA's investigation she reviewed clients' cash resources/allowance records, which due to these errors made the records unreliable.

    "narrative": "There were also multiple incidents in which one client was sexually inappropriate with another client by flirting, trying to show their genitals, dry-humping, and more. Interviews revealed that for the majority of the time, staff did intervene to stop this from occurring, however some clients stated that it was not at all times. One staff stated these incidents sometimes occurred quickly and out of view of staff. Clients stated they would often rough-house with each other, and some stated staff would tell them to stop. In one incident, a client allegedly poked another client in the anus. When staff became aware of the allegation, it was immediately reported and investigated by the facility. After the facility investigated, they issued a discharge notice for the client on an emergency basis to keep the other clients safe. Based on interviews LPA found there was a clear pattern of one client being physically inappropriate and aggressive with other clients in the home, and while action was taken with the aggressing client it is unclear if action could and should have been taken sooner, based on the information provided. During interviews with seven clients, six staff, the Clinician, the Administrator, and the Executive Director, LPA was informed that the house is clean. Clients have chores and do them daily. If a client does not do their chore, staff clean up after the clients or incentivize other clients to cover the chore for more points. Additionally, all individuals interviewed except for one stated that a mess does not last more than a day, and most of them stated it lasts less than hours. One client stated it might last up to a day and a half. One client stated that after a client was in the bathroom sometimes there would be pubic hair, feces, urine, and soap. One staff stated the floors are sticky sometimes. LPA has visited the facility unannounced on many occasions over years, and has not observed the home to be messy or dirty. (continued)... During interviews with clients, staff, a witness, Administrator, and the Executive Director, LPA learned that a client had their money stolen on at least one occasion, but possibly more than once. The client stated the money was locked up with staff and it went missing. Other clients stated another client stole the money, or that they heard that it was a staff. The Administrator stated it was looked into and it was unclear, as sometimes the client kept their belongings in their room instead of locking it up, as well as brought money in without telling staff how much there was. The Executive Director was unsure of the outcome and thought that management had figured it out, as well as stated that if the money was lost by staff, then it would be replaced. All clients stated they are allowed to lock their personal belongings up with staff for safe-keeping, and some choose to do so. Staff repeatedly encouraged the client to safeguard their money. One staff stated they brought up the missing money during management meetings, and it was brushed off. Additionally, in LPA's review of the client's allowance sheets, there were some errors and entries that were unclear. LPA brought this to the attention of the ED, who discussed this with Administrator. In another visit to the facility for an annual on 3/6/2024, LPA observed a random sample of a client's allowance sheet in which LPA again observed errors. LPA addressed this with the Administrator during that inspection. Based on conflicting information, and lack of information, it is unclear if in this instance the facility failed to safe-guard the client's money. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to him.",

A witness stated the staff on shift responded immediately and appropriately to the fight. One client stated it took about five minutes for staff to respond. Another client stated when one client assaulted the staff, the staff left the situation, however the staff denied this. All interviews stated staff intervened and separated the clients.

    "narrative": "During interviews, one staff stated that due to the facility's consequences/level structure, it does not meet the clients' mental health needs as a therapeutic environment. One client felt the facility gives, \"shitty,\" therapy, however they met with the therapist twice a week. The client refused to see the facility psychiatrist, and saw their Kaiser psychiatrist instead. LPA was informed by the Clinician and one client that this client sometimes refused to engage or participate in the mental health services offered to them by Mile High. Another client stated they did get therapy at the facility, but stated it was not all that they needed. When asked what else they needed, the client stated they did not know and it was only something, \"someone,\" told them. One client stated there are Behavioral Techs at the facility but all they want to do is take them to the library and not talk to them, but the client also stated they refused to meet with mental health staff to have their mental health needs met, so it is unclear if they actually did not meet the client's needs. During other interviews with all other clients, they confirmed their mental health needs are met. There are Behavioral Techs who are in the facility daily to meet with the clients about their mental health and clients meet with the Clinician at least twice a week. Additionally, LPA was informed by the Clinician that a psychiatric nurse practitioner comes to the facility to assess the clients' medications and make recommendations. The facility has a psychiatrist as well who diagnoses clients and prescribes them medications. Based on LPAs interviews which were conducted and record reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. On this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 5, Section 87089.1(a). An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to him. In an interview with another client, they stated that Admin has a, \"slick mouth.\" When asked why they feel that way, they said because Admin told them, \"if you keep acting up you're not going to get your full allowance,\" and, \"always yelled.\" LPA clarified the meaning of yelling with the client, who maintained that Admin yelled, however gave no description of yelling. In another client interview, LPA was informed that Admin, \"yells all the time.\" The client stated Admin yelled at a client to get out of another client's room. When clarification questions were asked, the client determined Admin was not yelling, only raising his voice. The other clients stated Admin does not yell at them. Staff informed LPA that Admin is the one to address consequences with the clients. The Program Director explained that because of this he gets a, \"bad rep,\" but he is not yelling. LPA was informed that Admin has a, \"stronger,\" voice and some clients will say he is yelling, \"but he is just being firm.\" All staff interviewed denied that Admin yells at the clients. LPA was informed by one client that Executive Director (ED) Tegre Miles has cussed at them, telling them, \"you're on bullshit.\" Another client stated ED yells at the clients, but it is only to get his point across and not to scare them. The other clients denied ED yells at them. LPA learned from the Program Director that ED is also the one to address the clients' behavior and consequences with them. LPA was informed that it is true that ED could have a softer approach with some of the more, \"sensitive,\" clients, and they, \"could see how some kids can perceive some things negatively, though it is never inappropriate.\" LPA was informed that ED will explain to clients the consequences of their actions and they won't like it. One staff stated that ED speaks to the clients, \"very bold, disrespectful, and yelling and cursing.\" When asked for an example of this, the staff stated ED says, \"I don't give a shit,\" \"I don't give a damn.\" The staff stated however, that it is nothing abusive. Another staff stated ED has said to clients before to, \"cut this bullshit out.\" When asked about cussing to the clients, ED stated that he sometimes does talk to the clients in their language, or paraphrases what they say to him. ED stated he does not yell at the clients, but is a straight-talker with them. Based on this information it is not clear if ED and Admin do yell at the clients, or if it is a perception by the clients due to the nature of the conversations, the language used, and/or the natural voices of the ED and Admin. During interviews with seven clients, six staff, the Clinician, the Administrator, and the Executive Director, LPA was informed that the house is clean. Clients have chores and do them daily. If a client does not do their chore, staff clean up after the clients or incentivize other clients to cover the chore for more points.

LPA investigated this complaint by reviewing CFT notes and conducting interviews with eight clients, six staff, a witness, the Administrator, the Program Director, the Clinician, and the Executive Director on 12/29/2023, 1/24/2024, 4/5/2024, 4/9/2024, 4/15/2024, 4/16/2024, 4/17/2024, 4/19/2024, and 4/22/2024. One of the clients had been experiencing an increase in mental health crises and adverse behaviors. An emergency Child & Family Team Meeting (CFT) was scheduled to address this. After the emergency CFT was held on 2/5/2024, LPA reviewed the notes and found that neither the client's safety, nor the client's mental health concerns were discussed in the CFT, for which the purpose of the meeting was. Instead, only school and placement plans were discussed. When LPA asked Admin and Program Director why this was, they were unsure. LPA instructed Admin and PD to ensure another CFT is called to address these areas of concern. Both agreed to this, and the meeting occurred on 2/13/2024 in which the client's mental health needs and safety planning were discussed. A safety plan was created and the client was moved to Mile High's other house to improve the client's mental health. SubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

This inspection is to close the case management opened on 5/6/2024. The incident was in regard to a client (C1 - See Confidential Names List dated 7/10/2024) having to go to the emergency room due to asthma symptoms, and did not have an inhaler. LPA reviewed medical records, medication records, and emails. The client was placed on 3/23/2024, and on 3/25/ Administrator emailed the County Social Worker, informing her that the client stated they need an inhaler. The County Social Worker was not aware that the client needed an inhaler, and the client did not come to the facility with one. On 3/31/2024, as stated in the incident report dated 4/1/2024, the client went to the ER for shortness of breath, but did not want to stay to be seen. On 4/1/2024, the client was again taken to the ER by the facility to be treated for asthma symptoms and was prescribed medication to assist with them. On 4/19/2024 the client had a doctor's appointment and the doctor did not prescribe an inhaler, but assessed the client to have allergies. Since then, the client has had no other symptoms. LPA found the facility took the client to be treated for symptoms as required, and the facility was not informed prior to placement that the client needed an inhaler as the County Social Worker was not aware, and the client did not come to the facility with one. This case management is now closed, no further action necessary. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report was provided to him.",

The plan of correction that was agreed upon by LPA and Administrator was, \"By POC due date of 7/11/2024 the ED and FM will have been refreshed on de-escalation techniques, observed by Admin, and will submit a document acknowledging the different steps that could have been taken prior to restraint.\" LPA advised Administrator on 7/10/2024 that even if the citation and finding was disagreed with, the POC still needs to be completed as required. On 7/11/2024, Administrator emailed LPA informing her that they would not be completing the POC as they will be appealing, which is their right to do so. However, the POC was still required to be completed. LPA and Admin further discussed the citation-->POC-->appeal process. On this date, the facility is being assessed a Failure to Correct Civil Penalty in the amount of $700, which is $100 per day that the citation was not corrected after the POC due date of 7/11/2024.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility and met with Facility Manager Steven Anderson, who assisted with the inspection. The purpose of this case management inspection is to deliver the findings to the case management which was investigated by the Department's Investigations Branch Investigator (IB) Nathan Gonzalez, regarding an incident report received by the Department on 4/15/2024 by the facility. The reported incident stated that one client (C1) had been sexually assaulted when C1 was forced by a client (C2) to perform oral sex on C2 on the night of 4/15/2024. See confidential names list dated 8/9/2024. IB conducted this investigation by reviewing police reports, facility file information, and by conducting confidential interviews with one County Social Worker, three clients, three staff, the facility Administrator, and the facility Program Director, on 5/1/2024, 5/21/2024, 5/23/2024, 6/20/2024, 7/13/2024, 7/17/2024, and 7/23/2024. IB had also requested staff and Administrator write-ups relating to the incident from the Program Director on 7/17/2024, 7/26/2024, and 7/30/2024, which IB never received. IB found through their investigation that on 4/16/2024 a staff informed the Program Director that a non-consensual sexual encounter had occurred between clients. Clients were interviewed by Law Enforcement (LE) and informed LE that they were forced to smoke marijuana with C2 and play truth or dare. During truth or dare, C2 forced C1 to perform oral sex on them, under threat of physical violence. One staff (S1) was present at the facility during this incident and had called the Administrator of the facility, who was the on-call staff that night, three times for assistance with other escalated client behaviors with no response. S1 admitted to feeling that she, \"neglected,\" some of the clients who were upstairs during her shift. Staff reported to IB that they are directed to supervise clients from the upstairs media room during overnight shifts, and S1 acknowledged that she should have more effectively supervised the clients from the media room. Administrator confirmed to IB that he missed three calls from S1. Administrator informed IB that he and S1 were both reprimanded for this incident. The Program Director informed IB that staff are to follow the emergency phone call procedures when needing management assistance, however S1 did not think to do that in the moment. Based on information obtained by IB, IB found that S1 and Administrator failed to provide adequate supervision to clients during the early morning of 4/15/2024, which resulted in C2 sexually assaulting C1 while in care. On this date the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Section 80078(a), Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision, and Section 80044(c), Inspection Authority. See attached LIC809-D. An exit interview was conducted with FM, and a copy of this report, confidential names list, advisory note, and appeal rights were provided to him.",

C1 informed LE that ED pinched C1 during the restraint and twisted C1's arms, when he came in from the window. C1 also also reported ED was digging ED's elbow into C1's back. LE did later observe on C1, \"fresh abrasions with bruising and redness to [C1's] left forearm, which is the side ED restrained C1 on,\" and where it was alleged that ED pinched C1. Interviews with the children revealed: one child stated they did not see the restraint but heard, \"just a bunch of shouting and yelling.\" The child denied that any staff have hurt any child at the facility. One child stated ED and FM came into the room saying nothing and just restrained C1 on a dresser and then on a bed where C1 was on their stomach for a while until C1 stated they could not breathe. Then ED and FM flipped C1 over, and picked C1 and, \"put [C1's] head against the wall.\" The child stated ED told LE that they were restraining C1 due to them spitting on ED and FM. C1 admitted to LPA they had been on the roof out of boredom, then went to another client's room waiting for the ED and FM to arrive. C1 explained that ED and FM pulled C1 off of the bed to restrain them by taking their arms up and putting them on the bed on their stomach, \"to where I couldn't breathe.\" C1 explained then ED was, \"talking crap,\" to them and pinching them on their arm, which left bruises. FM was not doing anything that was hurting C1. The restraint ended when the police arrived. Interviews with staff revealed: one staff did not witness the restraint as they were supervising the other clients. One staff stated it was when C1 kicked out at ED/FM that they initiated the restraint. The staff denied that anyone fell and that C1 was not put on their stomach. FM informed LPA that when he and ED arrived, they entered the room, asked the other client to leave and C1 was, \"talking trash, doing threatening (gestures), so we went into the restraint.\" C1 was being threatening by, \"looking like [C1] was going to swing at [ED].\" Once on the bed, C1 was, \"just sitting there, no struggle, just verbal threats,\" but they continued the restraint until LE arrived. FM confirmed they advanced on C1 in the room, and C1 was only making verbal threats. ED informed LPA he and FM attempted to verbally de-escalate C1 while C1 was sitting on a bed. C1 became upset and swung their fist out which is when the restraint was initiated, and they stood C1 up against a dresser. They moved to the bed and C1 was still making verbal threats until police arrived after about 15 to 20 minutes. LE arrived and took over. ED denied C1 was ever on their stomach, denied he was upset, and denied that he was hurting/pinching C1 during the restraint. FM and the staff denied FM or ED were rough with C1. FM admitted other things could have been tried before restraint. ED stated he could not evade because he did not have the space. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

LPA met with Administrator via Google Duo, a video conferencing application. LPA also met with Administrator Kamiko Lucas. At 9: AM, LPA conducted a virtual walk-through of the facility, led by Administrator. LPA observed no deficiencies. CCL received an incident report on 10/27/2020 dated 10/19/2020 reporting that during a facility outing on a hike, client C1 (see confidential names list dated 11/5/2020) appeared tired at the end. C1 stopped to take a break and staff waited with her. Staff noticed C1 becoming disoriented by mumbling her words. Client then collapsed and was unresponsive. Staff called for assistance and 911. Other staff arrived with water for C1 but C1 was unresponsive. First responders arrived 15 minutes later and client was transported to a hospital, and later transported to a different hospital and a Liver Transplant unit for further treatment. On the same hike, another client, C2, became dehydrated. LPA is investigating what was provided to clients during the hike as far as food and water, why client went to the Liver Transplant unit, and what the outcome is. The incident report did not describe the outcome of C1's health. In speaking with Administrators Misty Jackson and Kamiko Lucas, LPA learned that C1 brought her own 32 ounce water bottle on the hike and had it refilled once, as well as got an additional 8 ounces. Clients had lunch for 1 hour. The hike was 7 miles, easy level, and they could go as slow as they wanted. C1's condition is improving and she did not need a liver transplant. LPA collected contact information for staff and C1's parents. LPA learned that C2 was provided with food and water as well. This case management requires further investigation into C1's case before a resolution can be made. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator Lucas, and a copy of this report was emailed to her with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

LPA discussed the findings for the allegation that staff inappropriately grabbed a minor in care, staff hit minors while in care, and Staff inappropriately restrained a minor. The allegations have been investigated and includes interviews with a County Social Worker (see confidential names LIC811), and three staff (S2, S3, S4) between 10/22/20 and 11/18/2020. The following documents were obtained: Needs and Service Plans, IRs, placement and discharge dates for two foster youth (FY1 & FY2), contact information for the foster youth, staff schedules, staff contacts, and facility program statement. The investigation revealed that two foster youth, FY1 and FY2, were under close supervision outside with one staff (S2). According to S2 the foster youths seemed to be planning to leave the facility without permission. S2 stated that FY2 began hitting him and yelling at FY1 to run. S2 placed FY2 in a one-person basket restraint to keep FY2 from assaulting him. UnsubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

LPA met with Administrator via Google Duo, a video conferencing application. CCL received an incident report on 10/27/2020 dated 10/19/2020 reporting that during a facility outing on a hike, client C1 (see confidential names list dated 11/5/2020) appeared tired at the end. C1 stopped to take a break and staff waited with her. Staff noticed C1 becoming disoriented by mumbling her words. Client then collapsed and was unresponsive. Staff called for assistance and 911. Other staff arrived with water for C1 but C1 was unresponsive. First responders arrived 15 minutes later and client was transported to a hospital, and later transported to a different hospital and a Liver Transplant unit for further treatment. On the same hike, another client, C2, became dehydrated. LPA investigated this case management by interviewing two Administrators and the Biological Parent of the child on 11/5/2020 and 12/22/2020. LPA found based on interviews that the facility provided all necessary care for the client on the hike, and took quick action to ensure the client's safety when the client collapsed. Based on interviews, the facility's quick action is what saved the client's life. The client's condition is not a fault of the facility, and could not have been predicted. No further action necessary. At 4: PM, LPA conducted an exit interview with Administrator. A copy of this report was sent to Administrator by email along with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess had a call with Administrator, Misty Jackson, to deliver this case management inspection. LPA met with Administrator via Google Duo, a video conferencing application. On 7/24/ CCL received an incident report dated 7/19/2020 describing a client in crisis who left the facility and walked to Walmart. While in Walmart, the client hid from staff, grabbed some items, went into the bathroom, then left Walmart. The client approached strangers asking them to call Law Enforcement (LE), but they did not respond. Staff attempted to talk to the client but the client was not receptive and ran away to a nearby Shell gas station where she again solicited help in calling LE, but was denied. LE arrived and the client told them that she was being mentally abused at this facility. LE counselled the client and eventually she returned to the facility. The client wanted to call her mother and someone else that she was not permitted to call. Staff asked the client to take a time-out before the call with her mother. The client left the facility again and LE was called. LE attempted to talk to the client but the client walked back towards the facility and picked up rocks and threw them at the facility vehicle, breaking the windshield and driver side window. LE detained the client in handcuffs and returned her back to the facility. Staff made a plan with the client and she was released from the handcuffs. The client started a time-out but stopped and picked up a \"log-sized\" stick and charged into the facility vehicle's windshield, breaking it more. LE instructed the client to put the stick down but she did not. LE pulled their taser out and threatened the client that they would use it if she did not put the stick down. The client refused and LE told her to get on her stomach, which she did. The client was then placed in handcuffs and detained once more. The client was taken to Juvenile Hall. LPA investigated this case management by interviewing six clients and three staff on 8/12/2020, 12/15/2020, and 12/23/2020. During interviews with clients, they stated at least one staff in particular has been speaking to clients in a way which is aggressive, intimidating, and mentally abusive. During LPA's interviews with the clients, both former and current, they brought up this staff's name independently and gave similar kinds of examples for how this staff spoke to them and others in an inappropriate or abusive way. During LPA's interviews with staff, they denied that staff had said the things that were alleged. Staff stated that the accused staff is a firm or strict staff, but denied any abusive behavior. The accused staff denied all abusive claims, but did state that she has had trouble with her tone and how she comes off to the clients. The staff stated that because of that she could possibly be seen as abusive by the clients, however that is not the case. The staff stated she has been working on this issue with her tone of voice, as well as keeping the clients accountable so they can successfully graduate from the program. The staff recognized that she needed to correct her tone because the clients can come from environments in which people were abusive. The staff explained that she is the staff that enforces rules and holds the clients accountable, which they do not like. Based on all the information given, it is evident that while the staff many not have set out to intentionally cause harm to the clients with the way she speaks, that is the effect it has had on the clients. Clients stated this has created a negative affect on their mental health and emotional health, and has affected their behavior and program success. The way the staff speaks to the clients is at times not trauma-informed and has resulted in the clients feeling mentally abused. On this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 3.1, Section 87072(d)(11). At 4: PM, an exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was sent to her by email with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

    "narrative": "During that AWOL incident, the client ingested glass in the presence of staff when they caught up to her and was hospitalized because of it. LPA addressed the client's dangerous ingestion of harmful objects previously with the facility during Case Managements dated 3/13/2020 and 6/25/2020. On 6/25/ LPA issued an advisory notice advising staff to ensure they take into consideration clients' previous behavior patterns to assess at what point they should physically intervene when a client is being unsafe. The same client ingested glass pieces and broke her tooth while biting a pen during an incident that lasted from 2: PM to 3: PM on 3/30/2020. Staff did not physically intervene until after the client was able to self harm by ingesting the items. During IB's investigation an individual stated that the client needed 1 on 1 supervision. IB found that the lack of supervision allegation that a resident was hospitalized from incident that occurred while in care is SUBSTANTIATED, or true. Additionally in IB's investigation there were statements made about staff treating the clients poorly. This was addressed by LPA during a Case Management dated 12/23/2020. LPA cited the facility on that date. During IB's investigation, another staff's name was mentioned who treated the clients poorly, however that staff no longer works at the facility. IB found that the facility did not report the incident to the authorized representatives timely. The mother of the child did not know there was an incident until she was contacted by the hospital days later requesting permission to anesthetize the client in the hospital. The assigned County Social Worker was not notified until days after with a partial report. Then, the CSW received a full report the following week. IB found the allegation that the facility did not report the incident to the authorized representatives to be SUBSTANTIATED, or true. On this date the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulation, Title 22, Division 6, Sections 80078(a) and 80061(f). At 11: AM an exit interview was conducted with Administrator. A copy of this report and appeal rights was emailed to Administrator with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that staffs' behavior posed a risk to clients in care, this concerned two areas - staff being on their phones and not paying attention to clients, and one male staff being inappropriate with one client in care. During interviews, all but one interview corroborated that the male staff was not inappropriate towards that client, even when the client was being inappropriate towards him. The staff met with the client and the client's therapist to help in setting boundaries. The staff made all attempts and efforts to stay away from that client. LPA found no basis in the accusation that this staff was inappropriate towards the client. LPA learned that staff used to be on their phones sometimes when they were not supposed to. The facility addressed this at the time by discussing phone rules with them while they are working. Even though staff would be on their phones sometimes during working hours, they also communicated with each other about work, or taking work notes. While the staff may or may not have been on their phones when they weren't supposed to be, there was not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that this did or did not pose a risk to clients in care, therefore LPA has found this allegation to be unsubstantiated. Regarding the allegation that staff withheld food from clients while in care, statements made during interviews were conflicting. All staff denied this allegation occurred. Two clients stated it occurred, however gave different stories about how it occurred. One client denied this ever occurred. Based on the conflicting information, LPA found that while this allegation may have occurred or is valid, there was not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that it did or did not occur, therefore LPA has found it to be unsubstantiated. For the allegation claiming that staff inappropriately restrained a client while in care, LPA also received conflicting information. Two clients stated they have not been in, nor observed an inappropriate restraint from any staff. All staff denied inappropriately restraining any client in care. One staff stated that one staff does grip too tightly during restraints, but does not bend or twist the client in an inappropriate way; the holds are appropriate. Based on the conflicting information, LPA found that while this allegation may have occurred or is valid, there was not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that it did or did not occur, therefore LPA has found it to be unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted with FM, and a copy of this report and appeal rights was emailed to FM with a read receipt which will serve as the record of receipt.",

LPAs and staff conducted a walk-through of the facility and found there to be clean and adequate bedding, supplies, an adequate amount of perishable and non-perishable food, the house was at a comfortable temperature, there were no obstructions in the halls or walkways, and there was an adequate amount of silverware, plates, and cups and they were in good condition. LPAs observed one window screen in an unoccupied client room to be in disrepair, the excess refrigerator in the shed to be dirty, and ziplock bags in the chemical cabinet, which would be used for food. LPA instructed staff to move the ziplock bags, that the refrigerator needs to be cleaned, and the screen repaired. License and complaint procedure were posted. LPAs observed the facility vehicle to have a cracked windshield, spidering across the entire windshield in three directions, the air conditioning in the car works, and the car turned on. LPAs observed no evidence of smoking in the facility or on the grounds as required. There was no cushioned material under the swingset, and the swingset was secured to the ground as required. There was a vent grate coming off of the side of the trailer building, which needs to be secured. The kitchen water temperature measured at 129.5, which is above the required range of 105 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The blinds in the kitchen were not clean. LPAs reviewed the clients' allowances and found all to be accurate. LPAs reviewed the client medications and found all Medication Administration Records to have all required elements on them, and all client medications were maintained appropriately. LPA reviewed the disaster drill logs and found the facility to be conducting them as required. On this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 5, Chapter 1, Section 80074(c) Transportation, and 80087(a) Buildings and Grounds. Additionally, the facility is receiving five Technical Violation Advisory Notes, which are not citations, lack of cushioning under the swings, not having a register of clients per regulation, and the ziplock bags being stored in with the chemicals, and the water being inconsistent temperatures, occasionally exceeding the 120 degree limit.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Burgess made an unannounced case management inspection at the facility and met with Facility Manager (FM) De'jana Crockett who assisted with the inspection. LPA spoke with staff and clients regarding the facility. During confidential interviews with three staff, one Administrator, one Clinician, and two clients, LPA found that in the past around 2020, clients have been made to be outside for extended periods of time, and denied entrance into the facility. One client stated a client had to stay outside the facility for a few hours after returning from an AWOL. Another client stated they were not allowed inside of the facility because they were a, \"danger,\" to the others. The client stated they were outside for the whole day, and this happened on about three occasions. One staff confirmed that client had been outside for many hours before, and was not allowed inside. The staff described that client as a, \"trouble-maker.\" The client had AWOLd and was self-harming. The client had repeatedly run away that day and when returned, the staff and another staff were told to keep the client isolated and in timeout, so for a half a day, that client was made to stay outside in the timeout spot. When LPA asked that staff if the client was ever outside overnight, the staff stated no, however, \"for almost all day [the client] would be out there for her not being respectful or being off baseline. We would separate [the client] from the girls and let her be isolated.\" LPA asked the staff how often that client or other clients would be left outside like that and the staff stated, \"if I had to guess...[the client] was our main problem-child and we had to deal with her everyday and I would say she was out there four to five times a week...when she was bad, she was bad, so we would rather have her outside than disrupting the group inside.\" The staff stated that client was, \"out there sometimes all day.\" When LPA asked the staff if that client had to be outside in the dark, the staff confirmed the client did. When LPA asked the staff if the client was locked out of the facility, the staff confirmed, and stated it was because the client wanted to harm the other clients inside the facility so the client was locked outside to protect the other clients inside. One staff stated that if clients are escalated outside, they do not want the clients to come inside and harass the other clients, or break things, so they keep them outside. Another staff confirmed that clients have to stay outside the facility until they are calm. LPA asked the staff about the client being locked outside, with staff there, and the staff confirmed this, stating, \"yeah, until she calmed down.\" The Clinician confirmed that one of the clients was kept outside a lot, and not allowed back in. The Clinician explained, \"their standard is they have to show they are back in program to come back in.\" The Administrator stated they do not keep clients outside for hours, \"but an incident could last for hours with a client that's outside.\" The Administrator also confirmed that clients could be outside in the timeout shelter at nighttime if they are off baseline. Administrator also confirmed that if a client is outside and wants to come in to harm another client, they are not allowed inside. Based on the collective information gathered, LPA found that the facility inappropriately kept clients outside of the facility. Although the facility is now a Group Home, at the time this occurred they were still a Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program, therefore Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 3.1 (2020), Section 87072(d)(11), Personal Rights is being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.

    "narrative": "One staff stated clients were not denied any meals, \"unless they were off baseline and weren't acting right we'd be like, 'you get a snack,' it's too late for dinner.\" The staff stated that even when they made the snacks (items like chicken nuggets or something similar), the clients always ate something, and this happened on at least two occasions. One staff denied that clients had food withheld and stated if there were escalations during mealtime they would call another staff over to help and ensure the clients got to eat. Another staff stated if there were escalations during dinner time, the clients would get sandwiches. The Clinician and Administrator had no knowledge of food being withheld. Regarding the allegation that staff caused an injury to minor in care, confidential interviews revealed the following: one client does not remember that happening. One client stated they do not think this happened. Another client stated there was an escalation one time where a staff grabbed a client by the wrist, hard, which was not during a restraint. One client stated they had bruises and their arm hurt after being restrained. That client stated the staff intentionally hurt them and grabbed them hard. The client also stated they did not receive medical care for the injury, however this was unable to be corroborated. All staff and Administrators denied having knowledge that medical care was not obtained when any client needed it. One staff stated they never witnessed any staff hurting a client. One staff stated they have hurt a client before unintentionally during restraints due to clients squirming, however when told that the client was hurting, the staff loosened their grip or rearranged. When asked if the staff has ever lashed out physically to a client, the staff admitted that they may have held onto a client tighter. The Clinician stated that staff have, \"probably,\" hurt a client during a restraint because that's the nature of them, \"the fight between bodies.\" One staff thought they remembered one client's arm hurting after a restraint but did not remember the details. Both Administrators had no knowledge of this occurring. While staff may have unintentionally caused discomfort to clients during restraints, there was not a preponderance of the evidence that staff caused injury to them. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted with FM and a copy of this report and appeal rights was left with her. When one Administrator was asked what does taking clients' shoes after an AWOL have to do with safety, the Administrator stated, \"if the client shoes were taken we would go back and look at why were the shoes taken for AWOLing, it would just have to be looking at who that kid was and why,\" which did not answer the question. The Administrator stated that sometimes clients AWOLed with no shoes on. The Clinician confirmed that staff took away clients' shoes, but stated clients were not made to go outside without their shoes. When LPA asked one staff what the circumstances would be that a client would not have their shoes, the staff stated, \"if they AWOLed and they wouldn't have shoes.\" LPA asked the staff if that is because staff would take clients' shoes if they AWOLed, which they responded yes.\" This instruction came from the supervisors. Two staff and one Administrator stated that clients would also AWOL without their shoes. Interviews with staff revealed client shoes would be confiscated from clients for up to two days. When LPA asked one staff why the shoes are taken away, the staff stated, \"\"so it's easier to restrain [them] and not let [them] run away.\" When LPA asked one staff if a particular client had to be outside without shoes on, the staff confirmed and stated, \"\"we took [the client's] shoes off all the time, well not all the time, but it was more of a repeated offence in the same day, so we would take [the client's] shoes.\" Interviews with clients revealed that clients did have to be outside without their shoes on. One client stated that they would have to go to the, \"timeout shelter,\" outside when the client was off baseline. This included when the client did not have any shoes on, and the client was not permitted to put them on. Another client stated when they went outside their shoes were confiscated, so the client was not able to put them on. The client also stated that on one occasion they had to go outside in the timeout shelter with no shoes on when it was rainy and cold outside. Staff confirmed that the timeout shelter was used to take timeouts for the clients. Another client stated their shoes were taken away for it, \"being a danger,\" that they would AWOL, and they had to do PE outside with no shoes. Two clients stated the shoes would be confiscated for up to a week. LPA learned from interviews with staff that they are no longer taking clients' shoes, and this only happened in the past. Based on interviews LPA conducted, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation is found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Although the facility is now a Group Home, at the time of this allegation they were still a Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program, therefore Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 3.1 (2020), Section 87072(d)(11), Personal Rights is being cited on the attached LIC 9099D.

    "narrative": "The first allegation is whether \"Direction Following\" and timeouts outside during days of extreme heat were inappropriate forms of discipline. Online research concluded there were 12 days in August and 9 days in September 2022 that temperatures exceeded 100 degrees, of which 10 were consecutive days. However, resources did not conclude on a specific duration that was unhealthy to be outside but identified other risk factors to consider like water intake, type of clothing, and specific time of day. The facility's program statement regarding their \"Positive Discipline Policies\" does not include specifics on direction following and timeouts. In addition, the agency does not have an extreme weather policy that addresses how their program will adjust client discipline or other outdoor activities. All client interviews reported generally being outside up to 20 minutes for disciplinary type reasons. However, due to the other risk factors are unknown like water intake, type of clothing, and specific time of day, it is not possible to determine if the regular discipline practices were inappropriate during this specific time. The next allegation is whether staff is rude or yells at clients. All staff and client interviews lacked any specific details or situations that could be compared or corroborated. Interviews were consistent that some clients and staff talk loudly in the facility, but less clear if the yelling is directed at clients. Some interviews said there were no incidents of disrespectful or rude behavior or language by staff. However, since inadequate details were available, it is not possible to confirm whether the allegation occurred or not. Based on the investigation, records reviewed and interviews conducted, the complaint finding is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted. A copy of all reports and appeal rights were provided to the facility via email. The allegation is whether the facility meets the staff to client ratio of 1:3 during morning and evening shifts. Client interviews included a variety of details when only one staff was present: during \"1:1\" (specific supervision of unsafe clients), and when a staff leaves to follow a client who has left the facility without permission. The interviews did not clearly indicate a violation of staffing ratio since additional details were unknown, like when additional staff arrive. However, four of eight staff interviews confirm the staffing ratio was not 1:3, during various escalations and additional staff either was not scheduled or available. Some staff believed the approved ratio was 1:4. Escalation that result in restraints can also result in staffing ratio not being met. Based on the investigation, records reviewed and interviews conducted, this allegation is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The facility is cited on the attached LIC 9099D for the violations of Interim Licensing Standard, Article 6, 87065.5 (a)(1) which are an immediate risk to the health and safety or personal rights of minors in care.

LPA investigated this incident by conducting confidential interviews with three clients, two Clinicians, and three staff on 6/22/2023, 6/27/2023, 6/29/2023, 7/3/2023, and 8/2/2023 to determine whether or not the incident was handled appropriately. LPA found that two out of three staff supported the two clients in crisis during the incident appropriately. One staff was not as supportive to other staff during the incident, however fulfilled their role during the incident adequately by supervising the other clients. During a conversation with Administrator Misty Jackson, LPA informed her of the concerns regarding the one staff's lack of support with their peers, and general attitude. Administrator informed LPA that they had noticed this as well and had already terminated that staff. LPA found that staff confiscated a journal from a client due to the journal and note-passing being a source of conflict and inappropriate contact among the clients. This action triggered the client into crisis. LPA found through interviews that the decision was made to keep all clients in the facility safe, and the responding staff supported the clients in crisis appropriately. This Case Management investigation has been concluded. No action necessary. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report was left with her.",

    "narrative": "LPA found that sometimes, \"Animal Direction Following,\" is employed, which consists of various relatively quick tasks the clients have to do to tend to the animals to make up for time out of program, specific to the animals. Based on interviews with all staff and clients, LPA learned this is not done for an excessive amount of time. Additionally, staff will take off more time the clients have to work off, than the client actually worked off doing the extra chore. Direction Following in general is when a client is out of program, they accrue time they then have to work off by doing another chore. Based on interviews with all staff and clients, LPA learned that during, \"barn chores,\" staff help the clients clean the animal stalls and tend to the animals. These tasks take about 45 minutes to an hour, and the duty is rotated between the two Mountain Valley houses. Some clients felt that barn chores was a punishment because they did not like doing the tasks. Based on information gathered from all interviews, the barn chores and Animal Direction Following are not inappropriate discipline, and are not unreasonable. LPA found during interviews with the clients, staff, and Clinicians that an SLL is utilized when a client harms themselves or are generally being unsafe. When asked what consequences/punishments are given to clients, one Facility Manager (FM) first stated, \"a safety level lower--anything that's self-harming, cutting, dangerous behaviors, that's a red. So, that just means like if we go on outings, they're not safe enough to go on outings for that week.\" LPA asked that FM why clients are punished for being unsafe and the FM stated that it is not a punishment, but restrictions put on the client because they are not being safe to go on an outing. FM stated that some clients do take it as a punishment. During LPA's interview with one Clinician, when asked what consequences are given, the Clinician also mentioned the SLL, and one of the reasons given for how a client can get that is by self-harming. LPA found that the way an SLL is framed, it can be perceived as a punishment for being unsafe. During interviews, three clients felt that a SLL for self-harm behavior was a punishment/consequence. Due to this ambiguity, LPA has found the allegation that staff inappropriately disciplined children in care to be unsubstantiated. While the SLL itself is not inappropriate, nor is it disciplinary, it has been perceived as such by the clients. LPA is issuing an advisory note to the facility to modify this framework and language used surrounding SLLs. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report along with appeal rights was left with her. One client stated S2 makes them scared when S2 gets upset, another client stated S2 makes the clients scared when S2 yells at them, and three other clients stated that S2 yells or screams at them. One client stated S2 makes them feel stupid. The Administrator confirmed that S2's frustrations have come to her attention from the clients and Administrator will be meeting with S2 to discuss this. Based on confidential interviews with one staff and 4 clients, LPA also found that staff S1 has made comments to at least two clients which were not appropriate, nor dignified. LPA found that S1 has made comments to at least one client such as, \"you're a spoiled brat,\" / \"you're a selfish and entitled brat,\" calling them a, \"devil child,\" telling them, \"you shouldn't have woken up today,\" and, \"you should have never come back from your home visit.\" Three clients confirmed S1 has said these phrases, among others, to one client in particular. At first when LPA asked S1 about calling a client a, \"devil child,\" S1 denied it. When informed that multiple people have confirmed S1 said this, S1 admitted to it, however stated it was in a playful way. Afterwards, S1 did admit to thinking S1 probably said, \"you shouldn't have woken up today,\" in the context of the client's behavior being poor, so they may as well have not woken up yet. Two clients stated that S1 would make jokes about at least two clients, but they would be hurtful. Two clients claimed that they think S1 was just being playful, or that it was hard to tell. Based on this information, even if what S1 said was in a playful manner, this was not received as such, and is not trauma-informed. All staff, Administrator, and Clinicians denied ever witnessing or having knowledge of S1 shaking a client, throwing objects at a client, yanking the blankets and headphones off of a client, and dragging any client out of bed. S1 denied doing any of these acts as well, but did state that S1 would shake the client's bed to wake the client up, which would be unsuccessful. When asked if she has ever lashed out physically to a client, S1 did admit that she may have held onto a client tighter. Two clients stated that they witnessed S1 yanking the covers off of a client, and throwing pillows at the client. One client stated they witnessed S1 dragging a client out of bed by their feet. That client stated they believed S1 throwing the pillows was in a playful way, but was unsure, and that they did not know if S1 was being playful when dragging the client out of bed, but S1 was laughing when she did it. Of the 10 clients LPA interviewed, LPA interviewed five former clients from the Mountain Valley Bar Du facility for a matter unrelated to this complaint. During those interviews however, statements were made regarding S1 which support the allegations of this complaint being true. Four clients stated S1 made hurtful and inappropriate comments to them and others, one client stated S1 grabbed another client's wrist hard, one client stated S1 dragged clients to their room by holding them under their arms, one client stated S1 called a client an, \"evil child,\" and two clients stated S1 yelled at them and other clients. Additionally, On 12/23/ LPA Burgess concluded a case management investigation regarding an accusation that staff were mentally abusing clients at Mountain Valley's Bar Du facility. S1 is a Bar Du staff, however, has worked at both facilities and interacts with clients from both facilities. LPA found during that Case Management in 2020 that S1 had spoken to clients in a way that made them feel mentally abused. LPA issued a citation at the time: 87072(d)(11). Regarding the allegations that staff spoke inappropriately to minor in care, and staff handled minor in a rough manner: both current and past statements from Bar Du clients support the statements from clients in this investigation regarding the way S1 has spoken to them, and physically handled them. Based on LPA's conducted interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Version 4, Section 87072(c)(10) is being cited on the attached LIC 9099D. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator and a copy of this report along with appeal rights were left with her.",

    "narrative": "The incident of this complaint was said to have potentially occurred during class time when the two Mountain Valley facilities combined clients for school for a period of time, where C1 touched another client's thigh and near their private parts. LPA learned that this class arrangement was due to the Teacher at the Gerber facility being out on leave from October 2023, and returning in the beginning of January 2024. During that time, the Bar Du teacher covered classes for about a month until another staff obtained their Teaching credentials and took over. During interviews with the staff and two teachers, one teacher stated C1 will, \"push the limit,\" of the boundaries with other clients. One teacher informed LPA that when they observed C1 tickle another client's upper back, they immediately stopped it from happening and had C1 removed from the setting. The staff and two teachers all stated the clients from both houses were rarely at the same house at the same time. If the Bar Du house was in one room for class, the Gerber house was in another room. The staff stated that occasionally they would have joint times where they might watch a movie together. Both teachers and the staff have knowledge of C1's propensity to touch other clients. The staff did not have any knowledge of C1 inappropriately touching the other client, and neither teacher remembered a time they were together. One client who was affected during the previous incidents in 2023 informed LPA that since that time, C1 has not been touching other clients inappropriately. The client informed LPA that staff do intervene and tell any client pushing boundaries to stop, however the clients do not listen. Additionally, C1, \"usually does it when staff aren't looking.\" Staff follow clients around, and clients have to ask staff before going anywhere, including the hall and to their room, to maintain supervision. C1 denied having any connection with the other client they were alleged to have touched inappropriately for this complaint, that they rarely saw them, and staff would separate them, and be more watchful of C1; staff would have more staff present and make sure no one gets too close. C1 denied inappropriately touching the other client and informed LPA that since the previous incidents that were investigated in 2023, C1 has not been touching any clients. C1 informed LPA when other clients go into each others' rooms, staff tells them to get out of their room, and staff watch in the hallway. C1 stated that when dating, there is no touching, no boundary crossing, and staff are, \"extra watchful.\" C1 stated if they are sitting too close, they have to move apart, and they cannot be alone with each other. Also, staff listen to the conversations they have with each other. C1 is romantic-relationship-focused and regularly seeks out clients to form relationships with. During an interview with a client who has been recently romantically involved with C1, the client informed LPA that staff were aware of their relationship and enforced heightened rules of keeping boundaries, no sitting close, no note passing, no reading each others' things, no sitting on the same couch, and no whispering to each other. LPA was informed of one incident in which C1 touched their leg and they later informed the Clinician, who addressed it with C1. Additionally, C1 tickled their upper back one time, which the Teacher immediately addressed. The client stated staff watched them, \"24/7.\" The client had no knowledge of C1 touching the other client inappropriately. Despite multiple attempts, LPA was unable to interview the client who was alleged to have been touched inappropriately. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted with Facility Manager and a copy of this report, confidential names list, and appeal rights were provided to FM and Administrator Misty Jackson.",

    "narrative": "The Administrator informed LPA that staff do not physically assist when clients self-harm unless it is severe. All staff denied that medical treatment was not provided when needed. All staff informed LPA that staff use verbal interventions when clients are self-harming. Three clients do not remember any time staff did not assist a client when they self-harmed, two clients stated when they self-harmed staff were there using verbal interventions, two clients stated staff clean the self-harm injuries and bandage them; staff do not ignore self-harm. One client stated staff did not take them to get treated for a hurt ankle, however this client struggled with having consistent memories during the interview. Pertaining to the allegations that staff speak inappropriately to clients and staff yell at clients, interviews with four clients informed LPA that staff did not bully a client or say anything mean, rude, or disrespectful to them. One client stated staff used to be harsh, but not anymore. Three clients stated staff will raise their voice, but do not yell. One client described S1 as being strict, but they are just enforcing rules and looking out for the clients. One client stated S1 will act mad, but not with the clients. Three clients stated staff can be stern or assertive, including S1. During interviews with staff and the Administrator, LPA was informed that S1 is a staff that holds clients accountable to the rules, and they do not like that. The Administrator and three staff informed LPA that S1 can be stern when giving directions, and three stated this can come off as rude or mean to the clients. Three staff informed LPA that clients do not like S1 because S1 upholds the rules. One staff informed LPA that themself and S1 have been frustrated at the clients before, but when staff are frustrated, they are just less playful and more assertive. Five staff deny that any staff has bullied any client. Two staff stated staff raise their voice to get clients' attention but do not yell, and all staff deny that staff yell at clients. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

The complaint alleges that S1 and S2 (See Confidential Names List dated 10/18/2024) spoke inappropriately to a client/bullied them, when one client self-harmed on one occassion they did not get medical treatment and staff did not address it, and that staff yell at clients. During LPA's interview with the client alleged to have been bullied by S1 and S2, they denied that it happened. During LPA's interview with the client alleged to have self-harmed and not recieved medical treatment/staff intervention, they denied remembering this occurring, stating instead that the staff always helped them when they self-harmed. The Reporting Party's (RP) credibility is questionable due to specific clients stating what the RP said happened to them by staff is not true. UnsubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

During that interview, S1 had a lack of concern for the allegations and was rude and unprofessional, so Mountain Valley terminated S1. IB made 10 separate attempts at communication with S1, all with no response. To this date S1 has not made contact with the Department. During the investigation, one client stated that S1 also showed them a gun S1 kept in their car. IB followed up on this claim by conducting follow-up interviews and there was not substantial evidence to prove whether this did or did not occur. The claim is therefore unsubstantiated.

Licensing staff and Ms. Jackson conducted an inspection of the facility inside and out and observed that the facility was in substantial compliance with the physical plant, inside of the facility and outside. LPA Hill observed that the facility has a separate but attached room for clients to conduct schooling, therapeutic services, and activities. The facility is licensed for six ambulatory clients in two dual occupancy rooms, and two single occupancy rooms in the facility. Licensing staff observed that the agency has a separate animal area that contains chickens, horses, pigs, rabbits and that the clients in the facility are responsible for the care and upkeep of the animal areas as part of the animal therapy program and chores. LPA Hill observed that the facility had four different carbon monoxide detectors, two were in the kitchen and activity areas, one in the staff/administrator's office, and one in the hallway outside of the client sleeping area. Fire extinguishers were last services on 1/30/2024. Water in the client bathrooms measured 112 degrees Fahrenheit and the toilets and shower functioned as required. The facility had the required two day perishable food supply and the seven day nonperishable food supply as required. LPA Hill obtained updated copies of the COA Accreditation Certificate, Mental Health Program Approval certificate, Emergency Intervention Log, and facility sketch during the inspection. LPA Hill conducted interviews with staff and client in care. LPA Hill did advise the agency that the window tracks need to be cleaned and that the rug in the meeting room needs to be fixed as the adhesive appears to not be making contact and the rug is curling. LPA Hill did issue advisories during today's inspection related to Disaster Plan including the emergency power plan and preservation of medications (if refrigeration is needed) and the plan needs to be updated and staff training needs to be provided upon hire and annually, disaster drills need to be conducted on the overnight shift (which could be just having a conversation with the clients in care on what to do), Emergency Intervention Log needs to articulate the de-escalation techniques used prior to manual restraint/hold and it must be documented that licensee/administrator conducted a review of the restraint after the incident. LPA Hill also advised that clients should be able to articulate a child and family team meeting, what is in their needs and services plans and how that documents comes about from the Child & Family Team Meeting. When discussing this with Ms. Jackson, it was indicated that the facility is planning to transition back to Group Home but that there is no date set for that at this time. LPA Hill did not issue a citation for this as further discussion is needed about this as the agency indicated that they do IEP meetings, Individual Educational Plan Meetings where they discuss behaviors and that they call them IEPs because the placing agency is educational. LPA Hill advised the agency that the previous Program Statement and Plan of Operation was approved in 2018 but is not current to standards since their initial licensure. While the agency is planning to transition, they are not current with the Interim Licensing Standards, Version 5. If the agency does not transition to Group Home, they will need to update their current Program Statement and Plan of Operation to be consistent with the Version 5 of the Interim Licensing Standards. LPA Hill asked that the program advise their LPA on their plan. LPA Hill did request that the following documents to be sent to Licensing by October 1, 2024, for the update of the facility file: LIC610, Facility sketch of the grounds including all areas to be used or visited by youth in care, Surety Bond, and LIC309. No citations were issued during the inspection and all documents were provided at the conclusion of the annual inspection.",

    "narrative": "The complaint alleges that facility failed to report an incident to the appropriate parties. On 10/21/21, C1 was involved in a restraint that resulted in an injury which required a trip to the emergency room. LPA obtained emails that show the placing agency was not notified of the incident from the agency until 10/25/21. Documentation shows the district contacted the agency and requested the report. Based on the documentation and interviews, the agency did not report the incident to the appropriate parties according to regulation. The complaint alleges the client's mental health needs are not being met. Consistent statements in interviews indicate there was an incident where S2 allowed C1 to use her Amazon account. The incident resulted in S2 owing C1 the unused funds on the account and taking multiple weeks to return the money. This resulted in C1 being upset with his therapist. Statements in interviews and documentation show that C1 did not participate in therapy sessions and often refused. IEP team meeting notes show that C1's lack of participation in therapy could have been a result from the incident involving the Amazon account. IEP notes show that on 09/28/21 the incident was discussed, and a new therapist was requested by C1 and legal guardian which was denied. On 10/20/21 documentation shows C1 was still requesting a new therapist and sessions were not improving. During the meeting on 10/20/21 placing county requested a new therapist. Agency stated that they do not have any other therapist available. Placing agency requested services be contracted out which agency did not provide. C1 was discharged from the program on 11/19/21. Based on documentation and corroborated statements in interviews, the agency did not ensure mental health supports as appropriate to the needs of the child. Based on the information provided during interviews and gathered from documentation, it is determined the preponderance of evidence had been met therefore the allegations have been substantiated. On this date the facility is being cited for violations of the California Code of Regulation, Title 22, Division 6, Sections 87095. Documentation and Reporting Requirements and 87089.1(d) Mental Health. Exit interview conducted and appeal rights provided. Complaint alleges that a restraint resulted in further injury. C1 had a prior injury that occurred while skateboarding. C1 stated he fractured his wrist while skateboarding. On 09/30/ C1 was taken to the emergency room due to wrist pain following a restraint. A case management was conducted on 10/08/21 to follow up on the incident. Agency sent LPA an email which stated the team was reviewing alternatives to restraints but had concerns over safety. On 10/21/ C1 was again taken to the emergency room due to shoulder pain following a restraint. During the restraint, C1 threw his head back causing staff to sustain a bloody and swollen nose. Consistent statements in interviews show that C1 was a difficult child to restrain and seem to escalate during the process. C1 was discharged from the agency due to agency no longer being able to meet his needs and safely restrain him. Due to the prior injury and the behavior of C1, the allegation that a restraint resulted in further injury is unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that staff inappropriately restrained a minor resulting in injuries and staff handled minor in a rough manner, LPA obtained photos of a minor who sustained bruising and fingernail mark injuries from staff after being in a restraint. No full serious incident report was submitted to the Department regarding the restraint to detail staff's involvement. The client indicated they were running away, which does not provide justification for use of physical restraint. Regarding a lack of supervision for the clients resulting in unsafe behaviors, there was an incident in which four clients were able to sneak out of their dorm rooms during the night unnoticed, to break into a principal's office. During the months of July-September 2024, 19 (24) hour serious incident reports were submitted to the Department without corresponding final reports being submitted. There were two reports involving the use of a restraint with no final report submitted to the Department. Staff interviewed were unable to explain to the LPA what the process is to report incidents. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. Four citations are being issued for violating Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section 87061(i)(7)(E ):Incident Reports, ILS Section 87072(c)(17), Title 22, Section 80028(a): Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision, and Title Section 80061(b): Reporting Requirements. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and LIC-9099D were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted. Appeal rights were provided. Regarding allegations of staff not addressing minors' health care needs, interviews with staff and clients indicated the facility has a medic on site. However, some interviews denied medical care as being available for clients when asked. Staff and clients reported that clients had access to three meals and a snack daily, but statements differed regarding the quality and quantity of the snacks, and the process for how to address when a client misses a meal. One staff reported that if a client acts up, they are not given a meal. Regarding the allegation of staff hitting a minor with a vehicle resulting in injuries, interviews were inconsistent. One staff reported that one client was hit by a golf cart and appeared to be injured, but when asked about their injuries, the client denied it. When LPA conducted additional client and staff interviews, none had knowledge of the incident. No incident report was submitted to confirm any other client or staff involvement. Regarding the allegation of staff not intervening when a minor engaged in self-harm, interviews were inconsistent. An incident did occur in the stabilization room involving electrical wiring. Client and staff interviews provided inconsistent statements regarding whether the wiring was exposed or not, and accessible to clients. LPA reviewed a video of a client pulling the electrical wire and getting shocked; however, interviews were inconsistent regarding whether there were holes or cracks in the electrical casing. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegations may have happened, or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violations did, or did not, occur.

Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Hillary Hall conducted the record review. LPM reviewed Incident reports, and records from the facility indicating 6 youth were drug tested 10 times during the time period of 8/24/24-12/27/24. Drug testing results provided to the Department did not include reported testing of 3 youth, referenced in an Incident report occurring 12/21/24. Of the 10 drug tests documented, three were done for reasons listed as return from home pass or day pass. All documented tests were negative for illegal substances. LPM reviewed the Program Statement for the facility and found no policies and procedures regarding drug testing youth. LPA Elena Soto-Gonzalez interviewed facility Head of Service on 12/30/24, who indicated the facility does drug testing when they have a concern the youth may have used illegal substances. LPM spoke with Program Director (PD) Paige Woodard on 2/4/2025 who indicated there were no known written or internal policies on drug testing the youth and the staff are not trained on drug testing. LPM spoke with representatives from five different Probation Departments. Two of these departments were unaware their youth had been drug tested at the facility, with one department specifically not authorizing the tests. Two departments had given verbal permission for the facility to drug test the youth, but were unaware policies or procedures were not outlined in the facility program statement regarding testing, with one of these counties choosing to no longer authorize testing by the facility. The fifth department contacted indicated they have not placed youth at the facility recently, but have detained multiple youth from the facility who had been drug tested following a return from home or a visit.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that one youth was sexually abused multiple times while in care, with the extent of the abuse being that one staff allegedly asked the youth to undress. Interviews with five staff and three youth provided inconsistent statements regarding these inappropriate interactions between the youth and the one staff member, with only one individual reporting these inappropriate interactions. No physical contact was reported between the staff and youth. Camera footage from one of the reported incidents, shows that the staff did not even enter the youth's room on the date and time of one of the alleged interactions. Interviews conducted with five staff were consistent that they have no knowledge of the youth being handled in a rough manner by any staff members. Three youth interviewed spoke of a staff member breaking up a physical altercation between the three youths. Two of the three youth stated that a staff member performed a restraint on one youth in order to separate this youth from the altercation. One youth was unsure if a restraint was used or whether the staff was holding the youth to break up the fight. An Incident Report received by the department explains that the youth were separated physically, but that no restraint was secured and that no injuries were sustained as a result of the staff member. Based on LPA's observations, interviews which were conducted, and records reviewed, although the allegations may have happened, or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violation did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED. A signed copy of this LIC-9099 report, the LIC-9099C, and appeal rights were provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted",

Confidential interviews revealed that the facility staff investigated the alleged inappropriate interaction between C1 and C2, but statements obtained by facility staff revealed that they could not determine if there was any inappropriate interaction between C1 and C2 as there were conflicting statements to what had occurred.

Confidential interviews revealed that facility staff does secure and inventory a client's belongings when they run away; however, confidential interviews revealed conflicting information on how soon after C1 ran away staff secured and inventoried C1's belongings. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that lack of supervision resulting in C1 engaging in inappropriate activities with C2, facility staff did not report C1 missing, facility staff did not safeguard C1's personal property, and facility staff did not inventory C1's personal belongings may have occurred; however, they not supported or proven by evidence.

    "narrative": "It was reported that clients were able to use the staff shower however, clients were refusing to use the restroom due to the restroom being dirty. Confidential interviews revealed that sometime in late October to early November, a plastic panel was installed in the bathroom shower located near clients' rooms. Confidential interviews revealed that the need to install the plastic panel was due to water continuously falling out of the shower causing water damage to the wall and base board of the bathroom. Confidential interviews revealed that the panel was installed in phases and after completely being installed, clients were unable to use it for the sealant to completely dry. Confidential interviews revealed that a sign was added to the shower informing clients not to use it. Confidential interviews did not reveal an exact time of how long the note remained posted and how long the shower remained in out of use status. Confidential interviews revealed that clients were instructed to use the second full bathroom located in the facility which can be used by both clients and staff. Confidential interviews revealed that staff informed clients to utilize the alternative bathroom shower while the other remained inoperable. Confidential interviews revealed clients were not utilizing the alternative shower due to it being small and \"dirty\" however, other confidential interviews revealed that the shower was not dirty but rather old. During a walk-through inspection completed by LPA Saeteurn on November 14, 2024, LPA Saeteurn was able to confirm that the shower located in the bathroom near client rooms had a plastic panel added and was being used once again by clients. Additionally, an inspection of the alternative bathroom near the facility kitchen revealed the shower was smaller in size compared to the bathroom near client bedrooms, and it appeared worn with superficial cracks on the tile flooring. Confidential interviews revealed that clients are encouraged to clean after themselves, however, the facility has also hired staff who are responsible for the cleaning of the facility. Additionally, during the walk through performed by LPA Saeteurn on November 14, 2024, a staff member was seen cleaning the facility grounds. Based on interviews and observations, the allegation that facility staff did not ensure client's shower was clean and in good repair is unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation occurred. Continued...

Record review reveals C1's food restrictions were documented by facility staff, and LPA observed the facility's procedure for ensuring clients' needs with food restrictions are met. Confidential interviews and record review reveal that, while C1 did struggle to find food she could eat at the facility, she was offered alternatives to her restrictions and did not go without food. However, other conflicting interviews indicated that the facility did not provide alternatives to C1 and would not cook food separately so that C1 would be able to eat part of the meal. Based on record review and confidential interviews the allegation alleging Staff verbally abuse C1 and Staff withhold food from C1 may have occurred, however it is not supported or proven by the evidence.

A confidential interview indicates that NA staff regularly sent C1 back to their residential unit, costing C1 educational progress. Conflicting confidential interviews indicate that NA and the school Administrator created a plan for C1 to complete schoolwork with teachers in an alternative area (residential unit) during C1's behavioral escalations. Confidential interviews indicate that C1 was regularly disruptive and threatening towards school staff and peers. A confidential interview also indicates that NA does not keep students' home from school for more than a day unless the student requires one-on-one supervision and is being assessed for a psychiatric hold (5150). Although a confidential interview with C1 disclosed that C1 wanted to be in class and was kept from attending, a conflicting confidential interview indicates that C1 would frequently walk out of class and refuse school in the morning. The Department also received the allegation that staff inappropriately acted as the youth's (C1) Education Rights Holder. A confidential interview and record review of the SW letter indicates that NA initiated an independent study for C1 without the approval of C1's Educational Rights Holder (EHR). A conflicting confidential interview indicates that EHR was informed and discussed the independent study with C1's school. Confidential interviews indicate that although C1 was often directed to leave class and complete schoolwork in their (C1) residential unit, C1 was never placed on an independent study. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegations that staff did not allow youth (C1) to attend school on-site as a form of discipline and that staff inappropriately acted as the youth's (C1) education rights holder are unsubstantiated.

According to information obtained by Community Care Licensing (CCL), the female clients' personal rights were not upheld during contraband searches that occur when clients return to the facility after school. Confidential interviews indicated that after female clients were asked to lift their bra wire, they were also instructed to jump repeatedly and shake their bra. Confidential interviews indicated that these contraband searches occurred primarily outside by the front gate and that female clients were checked next to or within seeing distance of male staff and peers. A confidential interview indicated that participating in this search with males present caused discomfort and embarrassment for at least one client in care. Confidential interviews indicated that female clients who attend a different school went through the contraband search process inside a private office with no other clients present or within line of sight. Confidential interviews indicated that the bra check described above occurred regularly for female clients, rather than as a response to suspected possession of contraband. Confidential interviews indicated that staff apply disciplinary consequences when clients refuse to participate in the bra check. Conflicting confidential interviews indicated that clients are allowed to refuse the bra check, but that staff place clients who refuse on enhanced supervision. Confidential interviews indicated that staff do not touch clients during the contraband search process. Based on confidential interviews, the facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards version 5, section Personal Rights (c)(15) \"The licensee shall ensure that each child, regardless of whether the child is in foster care, is accorded the personal rights specified in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16001.9, and below, as applicable: ... To be accorded dignity in their personal relationships with staff and other persons.\" Continued... ...CONTINUED Facility staff did not accord female clients dignity by conducting inappropriate searches outdoors in the presence of male staff and peers, which poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. An exit interview was conducted, and a signed copy of the report and appeal rights were provided to Michelle Jenks, Administrator.",

Other confidential interviews denied hearing a microwave being used the night of 12/22/20, smelled the aroma of food being prepared on stove and were not unable to taste the hamburger helper as it was thrown away. Confidential interview disclosed the rice was sticky and the meat tasted different than normal. Interview with FM and ADM disclosed the facility microwave is used to warm food up never to cook raw meat. On 12/30/20, LPA Flores observed there to be a sufficient supply of perishable and non-perishable food. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegation that staff (S1) did not provide proper food service to clients due to the fact that S1 did not cook the meat all the way on the night of 12/22/20, may have occurred, however not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. No deficiencies were cited.

Confidential interviews stated that they never observed C1 smoking a marijuana vaporizer in the facility or C1's bedroom. Other confidential interviews reported that smoking is not allowed in the home. Staff do room checks consistently, and if clients are in the bathrooms for an extended period, they start knocking on the doors to request that they finish and come out of the bathrooms. Confidential interviews reported that staff also checks the bathrooms when doing bedroom checks. Confidential interviews stated that staff supervise clients, and clients are never alone at the facility. Community Care Licensing also received an allegation of lack of care and supervision, resulting in injuries sustained by the infant (T1) while in care. It was alleged that C1 hit T1, and T1 received bruises and marks. Confidential interviews reported that T1 occasionally has marks due to their (T1) age and exploration as a toddler, and no marks have raised concerns, but no witnesses have seen C1 hit T1. Community Care Licensing also received an allegation that staff did not ensure the infant (T1) was being adequately fed, that the lack of supervision resulted in infant (T1) needs not being met while in care, and that the staff did not seek medical attention for the infant (T1). It was alleged that C1 had gone over half a day without feeding T1. Confidential interviews reported that T1 eats regularly throughout the day and that C1 has been encouraged to feed T1 independently and has continued to feed T1. It was alleged that T1 is not being treated for a diaper rash and is not being bathed consistently. A confidential interview disclosed that C1 bathes T1 at least once daily and has applied ointment/cream to T1's diaper rash when T1 previously had one. Confidential interviews reported that staff would provide diaper cream ointment for T1 whenever necessary but that T1 had a history of getting diaper rashes. Other confidential interviews stated that staff haven't recently observed T1 with a diaper rash. Confidential interviews reported that staff will bathe and provide food for T1 whenever needed if C1 does not. Confidential interviews stated that if staff observed T1 with a diaper rash, ointment/cream would be applied to the diaper rash immediately and consistently until T1's skin is healed if needed. Community Care Licensing also received an allegation that staff did not provide a safe and comfortable environment for minors (C1) in care. Confidential interviews reported that staff are not correcting, redirecting, or taking any action towards C1's behavior when needed. Additional confidential interviews reported that staff worked with C1 to help C1 transition to transitional living. (..) When behaviors are challenging, the facility discusses those behaviors with C1 and implements an appropriate plan to ensure that C1 follows the facility rules while being prepared to transition to transitional living. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegations of lack of care and supervision resulting in the minor (C1) smoking marijuana vaporizer while in care, lack of care and supervision resulting in infant (T1) sustaining unexplained injuries while in care, staff did not ensure infant (T1) was being adequately fed, lack of supervision resulting in infant (T1) needs not being met while in care, staff did not seek medical attention for infant (T1), staff did not provide a safe and comfortable environment for minors (C1) while in care are unsubstantiated.

At the time of placement, C1 was placed under increased supervision because staff were informed of C1's history related to CSEC. Since arriving at the current placement, a confidential interview reported that there have been no concerns or suspicions regarding C1 engaging in any CSEC related activities. Additionally, confidential interviews revealed that no witnesses observed C1 coercing peers into participating in misconduct or arranging for unknown males to meet and transport minors to and from the facility. Furthermore, C1 has been approved for community passes due to good behavior, allowing C1 to be unsupervised in the community for designated periods. While on these passes, C1 checks in with facility staff and returns to the facility at the scheduled time. As it relates to supervision, confidential interviews confirmed that the clients are adequately supervised. Staff maintain the required staff-to-client ratios across all shifts and call in coverage as needed. Staff also conduct regular room, and area checks throughout their shifts and document their observations in logs to ensure ongoing monitoring, accountability, and client safety. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegation that saff do not provide adequate supervision resulting in minors engaging in CSEC activities is unsubstantiated.

LPA's were greeted and granted access by Facility Manager Michelle Lofton; later joined by Administrator Jalisa Brown. The purpose of the visit is to conduct an annual/random inspection of the facility. At 9: AM, LPA Peete began the physical plant inspection; Facility Manager Jalisa Brown assisted LPA in touring the facility's interior and exterior grounds. During the facility inspection, LPA observed cameras in the common areas. The cameras are not pointed toward client bedrooms or bathrooms. According to Administrator Brown's statement, the video cameras do not capture audio and do not replace staff supervision. The facility consists of four client bedrooms and two bathrooms, one of which is a staff bathroom, that clients still have access to and are able to use. All toilets, sinks, and showers are maintained in safe, sanitary, and operating condition. Additionally, the water in each bathroom measured between 105\u00b0F and 120\u00b0F. The facility features a dining area, kitchen, living room, laundry room, garage with a visitor area, and a therapist's office. The facility's outside grounds have two sheds, in the backyard, which are utilized as offices by the Program Director and Head of Service. There are four locked storage containers containing client files, and one shed housing holiday decorations and miscellaneous items. All client bedrooms have individual beds with adequate drawers and closet space for each client. In addition, LPA observed that each client's bedroom was equipped with a small combination safe to store personal items or contraceptives. The clients' bedrooms are arranged so there are no more than two clients per room. LPA observed that all client beds had the appropriate clean linens, pillows, comforters, and mattresses in good repair. Extra linens and toiletry items are stored in the garage and hall closet closest accessible to clients as needed. Facility grounds are clean and free of debris and observable hazards. There is adequate indoor and outdoor activity space, and all exits and entrances are unobstructed. A toddler play area and patio furniture were observed in the backyard, along with other age-appropriate games and activities located in the garage, for the client's recreation time. All facility smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are in appropriate working order. The fire extinguishers are properly charged and placed throughout the facility. The facility maintains an adequate supply of perishable and non-perishable foods. Licensee maintains an adequate supply of food and a variety of snacks for clients. LPA observed a minimum of seven days of non-perishable food and a two-day perishable supply, and the facility appears to be following the posted menu. Cleansers, chemicals, and cooking knives are inaccessible to clients. Cleaners and chemicals are stored separately from all food items in a locked cabinet located in the garage. The cooking knives and all other sharp items are stored in the staff office, located inside a locked cabinet. All required forms are posted, including the Grievance Procedures, Visitation Policies, Personal Rights form, and Foster Care Ombudsman poster. Medications are locked and centrally stored in the staff office. No observable safety or health hazards were observed during the physical plant inspection, and no deficiencies were cited. LPA Peete reviewed the facility's operations, disaster preparedness, emergency interventions, and core therapeutic services. The core therapeutic services demonstrated that the appropriate services and supports for clients are trauma-informed, culturally relevant, and age- and developmentally appropriate. All required documentation was observed, and no deficiencies were found in the above-mentioned areas. LPA Robinson completed a review of five client files (C1 through C5). During the file review, it was noted that five of the clients did not have the required tuberculosis test. The licensee was cited with a type B violation of the Title California Code of Regulations 80069(c)(1) Client Medical Assessments. LPA Robinson also completed one client interview (C2), C5 declined. Based on observations made during the inspection, a deficiency is being cited (see LIC D). Due to time constraints, LPA's will return to complete the inspection at a later date. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report, along with appeal rights and the LIC Confidential Names List, was provided to the facility Administrator, Jalisa Brown.",

Confidential interviews denied that the altercation was a result of lack of supervision by staff and added that both C1 and C2 were friends prior to the altercation. Confidential interviews also stated that a staff was in front of C1 deflecting C2's swings and redirecting C2's threats when C2 kicked around the staff to make contact with C1. Staff immediately reported the information that resulted in law enforcement involvement and moving to different bedrooms. Other information states the allegation occurred. Regarding the allegation staff did not safeguard C1's personal items, confidential interviews noted staff are present and provide supervision according to the program statement or enhanced when it is needed or required in the needs and service plan. Staff deny not safeguarding C1's belongings and immediately intervened on attempts made to destroy C1's items. Other information states the allegation occurred. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegations that alleged staff did not prevent an altercation between C1 and C2, and staff did not safeguard C1's personal items may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

During this inspection, 6 out of Direct Care Staff and 5 out of 5 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 5 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated July 30, 2025). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Latricia Rogers observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Nannette Lewis- Administrator.",

Although S1 felt he made the right call to keep C1 safe, Staff did not follow facility's Emergency Intervention Plan that requires a staff team of two or more trained people to conduct the restraint. It was informed to LPA that S2 was making a phone call to the police while S1 was conducting the restraint. LPA could not determine if C1 obtained an alleged bruise due to LPA being unable to interview the RP and C1 after multiple attempts and no pictures were taken of C1.

Facility cited for Violation of California Code of Regulations, Title Division Six, regulation 80022(k) Plan of Operation: The facility shall operate in accordance with the terms specified in the Plan of Operation and may be cited for not doing so. Video footage confirmed that S1 failed to follow facility's plan of operation by conducting a restraint by himself when the restraint requires a staff team of two or more trained people to conduct the restraint. See 9099-D A copy of this report and appeal rights will be emailed to the administrator. Per interviews, C1 left the house and staff went out to go get the clients food due to dinner that was prepared getting thrown on the ground. S1 assumed C AWOLed and bought food for the clients that were present in the home.

Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA David Torres observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

It was alleged that C1 vapes in the facility and staff told C1 that they were going to have someone beat C1 up. The facility staff when interviewed indicated no staff has threatened to have C1 beaten up by someone else. Staff stated C1 did vape and smoke at the facility without permission. Staff would attempt to redirect C1 from smoking and staff would report each time C1 was found smoking or vaping. C1 when interviewed refused to answer questions and refused to participate in the interview. Two other clients interviewed indicated staff has not threatened any of the clients. Staff did not say they were going to have someone beat up any of the clients. The two clients stated C1 would smoke, however staff would redirect C1 who would not listen to staff. LPA reviewed CFT meeting notes and incident reports which indicated staff would report C1's smoking and attempted to redirect and seek help for C1's smoking. The other agency's investigative report and C1's interview indicated C1 denied any physical abuse by staff. All clients interviewed denied witnessing C1 get hit by staff.

Investigator Douglas Real conducted interviews with one County Social Worker (CSW) on 8/16/21, interviewed one House Manager 9/1/21, one Detective on 9/8/21, one Therapist on 9/29/21, one Client (C2) on 10/13/21, one Residential Counselor (RC1) on 10/21/21, one Assistant Director on 10/21/21, a second Residential Counselor (RC2) on 10/21/21, a third Residential Counselor (RC3) on 10/30/21, a fourth Residential Counselor (RC4) on 10/31/21, one Care Giver (CG1) on 11/2/21, a second Care Giver (CG2) 11/12/21. Investigator Real obtained a copy of the Chino Police Department police report regarding the incident on 9/8/21. On 8/5/21 the Department received a complaint alleging a facility client died from a drug overdose due to neglect by staff. Facility employees denied the allegation. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted revealed facility staff do not permit clients to use drugs and conduct safety checks every thirty minutes. Staff reported C1 did not disclose or present with behaviors indicating he intended to self-harm. However, C1 stated he wanted to \"get high\" while he and the facility therapist were processing a recent family visit. Staff reported safety checks were conducted on C1 every thirty minutes.

The investigation revealed the facility therapist placed C1 on suicide watch after C1 visited his dying mother. The facility therapist instructed RC2 to inform facility staff regarding the modified supervision plan. RC2 composed an email that was sent to staff on 8/3/21 at 6: PM. The email stated that safety checks were to be conducted for C1 every fifteen minutes. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with staff who worked during the evening of 8/4/21 to the morning of 8/5/21 revealed staff were not aware C1 was placed on suicide watch and conducted safety checks every thirty minutes. Record review of C1's activity log on 8/4/21 and 8/5/21 revealed staff conducted safety checks on C1 every thirty minutes, indicating the modified supervision plan was not followed by staff. Based on information gathered from interviews conducted and records reviewed the allegation is substantiated. The facility staff failed to check on C1 every fifteen minutes as requested by the facility therapist. The allegation is valid because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. Facility cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title Division Six regulation 80078(a): Providing Care and Supervision. Exit interview conducted.

    "narrative": "On 09/28/2022, the Department received a complaint alleging allegations that the facility was not maintaining a comfortable temperature for clients in all areas inside. The Administrator denied the allegation that the central air conditioning (AC) was not working and stated preventive maintenance was performed, however, it was then stated that another service technician was called to inspect the system on or about 03/22/2022. The Administrator stated that staff workers never informed him that the AC was not working. In confidential interviews, individuals associated with the facility (staff & clients) provided consistent statements that the AC system was not working for at least several months. It was disclosed that there were several times that a service repair technician was observed working on the AC system but was not operational and continued to remain in this state. Licensing Program Analyst observed a small window air condition unit in the living room area and was informed by the Administrator that it was recently installed because \"it was hot\". LPA also observed several (3-4) pedestal fans that were provided for the clients in each bedroom as a result of the AC not working. LPA Vargas together with the Administrator and then separately with the House Manager conducted a room temperature check in different areas within the facility using an infrared thermometer. The following readings were obtained: all client bedrooms were between 89 -90 degrees, the staff office was 90 degrees, the living room/dining area was 89 degrees and the window ac unit was already turned on. The central AC unit was running on cool mode, the air temperature exiting from the vents was 89 degrees at 12: PM. It should be mentioned that during the months of August and September 2022, there were days with temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees based on historical reports using the website Weather.com. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility was not maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the facility as a result of the air conditioning system (AC) not being operational and repaired in a timely manner. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. Following a review of the deficiencies cited per Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 8.8 of the California Code of Regulations, and listed on the LIC 9099D on page 2 of this report, LPA Vargas conducted an exit interview, explain appeal rights.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews revealed that staff are not following the approved plan of operation/program statement which identifies the proper way to discard discontinued medications. The staff were utilizing an RX destroyer pharmaceutical disposal liquid to dispose medication at the facilty but never informed Community Care Licensing (CCL) of the change. The STRTP is allowed to change a policy with an approval from CCL. In addition, the staff were not documenting the disposal on the Centrally Stored Medication and Destruction Record form (LIC 622) for destroying prescription medications when no longer needed by clients or residents correctly. In addition, the staff are not documenting an explanation on why the client refused their psychotropic medication on specific dates on the PMAR or equivalent form. The equivalent form is missing specific information required to be on the separate log. Confidential interviews indicated that the staff failed to log the forms correctly and were informed by the department of mental health to not utilize the LIC 622B form from CCL and to create a new form. LPA Portillo did not receive documentation on the denial from DMH. Based on interviews and information gathered during the investigation, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined the allegations that the STRTP is not utilizing the forms correctly to document refusal or destruction on medications for record keeping purposes is substantiated. This posed a potential health and safety risk to the children placed in care. These actions are in violation of the Health and Safety 1507.6 and Title 22 Health Related Services. See attached LIC 9099D for cited deficiency. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report and appeal rights were provided. Confidential interviews denied allegations that facilty staff failed to accommodate the needs of C1s medical treatment by not checking his glucose on time and not taking clients to their scheduled medical appointments. In addition, LPA toured the facilty and observed a lack of forks for clients that should have been accessible for clients. However, staff had additional utensils in the staff office to replenish the use of silverware. According to confidential interviews, the staff are proactive with the clients' medical needs and utilize the company vans to transport them to scheduled appointments such as medical, dental, school, outings etc. Other confidential information received stated that the reason for a shortage of forks is due to the clients throwing them away in the trash, taking them in their room or hiding them. Therefore, the staff monitor the silverware that's available for usage when requested. In addition, LPA Portillo inquired about the availability of plastic forks and the facilty placed some out for usage in case the clients prefer to throw them out due to specific reasons such as COVID. LPA spoke to C1s assigned County Social Worker (CSW1) who stated that at this time they did not have any concerns regarding C1's safety or the STRTPs level of care. There were no other known witnesses to this incident. Confidential interviews did not corroborate the allegations with a preponderance of evidence. Based on interviews and confidential information obtained during the course of this investigation, the allegation that staff are not equipped with enough medical supplies, lack of transportation or denial of silverware, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with an advisory note was provided.",

Foster children indicated fans were provided and the temperature was at a reasonable temperature. Interviews with staff denied the allegation that the temperature was uncomfortable for staff and clients. It was reported by one staff member that the central AC unit was not working, however the other wall ACs units were operational. Based on record review, it was determined that the AC outlet was broken and repaired by the maintenance crew in a timely manner. Staff and foster children reported that group meetings are part of the program and clients are highly recommended to attend to ensure they get the full benefits of the program. Resident council meetings are voluntary and highly recommended for clients to attend in order to voice their concerns and make suggestions. It was denied that the fans were removed from their rooms if they didn't attend group meetings.

LPA met with Facility Manager, Ariana Lopez, regarding a Special Incident Report (SIR) that was submitted to Community Care Licensing on 12/14/21. The SIR indicated that client C1 (reference confidential names form LIC 811 dated 02/17/22) told staff to call the ambulance because he had taken too many of something. The facility Administrator clarified during an interview with LPA that C1 just came from AWOL when the incident happened. When asked what C1 took too many of, C1 stated \"Triple Cs\". Triple Cs stands for \"cold, cough and congestion\" medication. After C1 informed staff that he needed an ambulance, staff immediately tried to call an ambulance. However, while calling for an ambulance, C1 told staff not to call the ambulance and that he was okay. C1 was offered ambulance and medical services multiples times but C1 refused. C1 also refused to sign a medical refusal form. Staff observed that C1 seemed okay and was acting normal. Staff monitored C1 closely throughout the night. Based on interviews with the Administrator, C1 must have obtained the Triple Cs while he was on AWOL. C1 refused to state where and how he obtained the Triple Cs. Upon return to the facility, C1 agreed to a search by taking his shoes off and emptying his pockets, in compliance with the facility's AWOL protocol. No contraband was found. LPA interviewed C1's county social worker (CSW) via telephone on 02/15/22. CSW stated he has no concerns about the facility regarding the care that was provided to C1. C1 is no longer residing in the facility effective 12/31/21. Based on the interviews conducted and documentation obtained, there are no violations of Title 22, Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations and no violations of Interim Licensing Standards Version 3 (ILS.3) Chapter 8.

Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA, Dina Camara observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

When staff inquired about the blood on the wall, staff observed cuts on minor's legs. Minor admitted to staff that minor attempted to hang himself using the towel rack, but the rack became loose. Minor gave staff the belt used and a toothbrush with a sharpened edge and no bristles. Staff called the police who responded then assessed and transported minor to Mary K. Shell. Staff reported minor took a long shower which was not unusual for minor. Staff checked minor every fifteen or twenty minutes by calling out on minor who staff could hear singing from inside the bathroom. Staff reported that minors are checked every fifteen minutes when inside their rooms, but the room checks are only documented by the graveyard shift when minors are asleep. Minors gave different responses when asked about room checks. Placement agency confirmed that since minor's placement at the facility, staff informed the placement agency of minor's reportable behaviors sometimes multiple times a day.

S1 indicated that the AWOL was immediately reported to the STRTP Administrator (S2). While S2 was being informed of the AWOL C1 called S2 stating that C1 was left behind after walking to the Dollar General store after S1 had asked C1 to wait in the lobby of the clinic, while S1 checked C2 in for their appointment and obtained more information on C3's previous test results. S2 immediately notified S1 who was dropping C3 off at school and returned to the area to pick up C1 who was still refusing to attend school and was taken back to the facility. Information obtained from the clients did not corroborate the alleged allegation and furthermore, C1 disclosed that at the time of the incident C1 was very upset and had exaggerated the incident to his father. Clients indicated that they feel safe and have no concerns about the care and supervision that is being provided by staff.

The client denied the allegation to IB and stated that nothing happened, that it was all a lie because the client wanted attention. There were pertinent documents found to support the statement provided by the client/victim to IB. Additional records show that the client/victim maintained that the abuse occurred while client fell asleep for about ten minutes, after being given pills by the other client. The client/victim felt a slight pain in the anus which the client did not feel prior to falling asleep. The client/victim, however, could not explain what happened after waking up and stated that another client told the client/victim that the client/victim was penetrated by the other client, which both clients denied. Staff and other clients in placement denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior by the alleged perpetrator. They stated that the client/victim has sexualized and attention-seeking behaviors. The SART exam did not find any evidence of trauma or tearing. Based on information obtained during the investigation, the allegation is unsubstantiated.

The inspection aimed to deliver the finding(s) regarding the complaint allegation(s). On January 29, 2024, the Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services received a complaint from the Centralized Complaint and Information Bureau (CCIB) with the following allegation(s): The staff did not prevent minors from bringing drugs into the facility; The staff did not provide adequate supervision, resulting in minor getting bullied while in care. This LPA conducted the investigation of the above allegation(s) and it consisted of but was not limited to a review of records, including the client's needs and services plans, medical records, and interviews with three staff members (S1), (S2) on 2/08/24, S3 on 2/28/24, (S3) on 1/24/24, two clients (C1) on 2/08/24, C2 on 3/06/24, the reporting party (RP) on 2/21/24 and the CSW on 2/28/24. (Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated July 15, 2024). Reported Allegations: 1. The staff did not prevent minors from bringing drugs into the facility. The facility staff (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the accusation and emphasized that they implement preventive actions like visual bag inspections and requiring clients to conduct self-searches in the presence of staff prior to entering the premises. However, despite these precautions, clients have previously attempted to smuggle contraband back into the facility after an unauthorized absence. This contraband, which cannot be visually detected by staff, is typically discovered during random room checks conducted for the safety of all clients. Any confiscated contraband is documented and disposed of appropriately. 2. The staff did not provide adequate supervision, resulting in minor getting bullied while in care. The facility personnel (S1, S2, and S3) denied the allegation by affirming that all staff members are well-versed in trauma-informed care and are dedicated to upholding a secure and healthy setting for both staff and clients. They made it clear that any form of bullying will not be accepted under any circumstances and urged clients to promptly report any such incidents to the staff or licensing authorities. Additionally, the personnel uphold transparent communication with clients and are prepared to step in when needed, either through verbal guidance or by separating individuals to avoid physical or verbal altercations. Information acquired from C1 and C2 contradicted the alleged accusations and confirmed the aforementioned details, expressing a sense of security while residing at the facility and acknowledging the staff's assistance in achieving their individualized plan. Moreover, the CSW noted that the facility staff are vigilant, conducting visual searches of items brought back to the facility and confiscating any contraband discovered. The CSW mentioned that she had no concerns about the care and supervision that was being provided by staff and indicated that the staff kept great communication via phone and email. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Foster Family Agency. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Lead Facility Manager. UnsubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

    "narrative": "Reported Allegations: 1. The staff did not prevent minors from bringing drugs into the facility. The facility staff (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the accusation and emphasized that they implement preventive actions like visual bag inspections and requiring clients to conduct self-searches in the presence of staff prior to entering the premises. However, despite these precautions, clients have previously attempted to smuggle contraband back into the facility after an unauthorized absence. This contraband, which cannot be visually detected by staff, is typically discovered during random room checks conducted for the safety of all clients. Any confiscated contraband is documented and disposed of appropriately. 2. The staff did not provide adequate supervision, resulting in minor getting bullied while in care. The facility personnel (S1, S2, and S3) denied the allegation by affirming that all staff members are well-versed in trauma-informed care and are dedicated to upholding a secure and healthy setting for both staff and clients. They made it clear that any form of bullying will not be accepted under any circumstances and urged clients to promptly report any such incidents to the staff or licensing authorities. Additionally, the personnel uphold transparent communication with clients and are prepared to step in when needed, either through verbal guidance or by separating individuals to avoid physical or verbal altercations. Information acquired from C1 and C2 contradicted the alleged accusations and confirmed the aforementioned details, expressing a sense of security while residing at the facility and acknowledging the staff's assistance in achieving their individualized plan. Moreover, the CSW noted that the facility staff are vigilant, conducting visual searches of items brought back to the facility and confiscating any contraband discovered. The CSW mentioned that she had no concerns about the care and supervision that was being provided by staff and indicated that the staff kept great communication via phone and email. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the (STRTP) Lead Facility Manager. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Lead Facility Manager.",

LPA reviewed needs and services plans for both clients and the police report generated from the incident. Based on the interviews and records reviews, C2 was receiving counseling in respecting the boudaries of others before the alleged incident and the facility moved quickly to address the complaints of the alleged victim C1 after the alleged incident,. C1 denied to staff, police officers and this LPA that C2 attempted to assualt him. However he and C2 did not get along and the facility quickly moved C2 to another bedroom to prevent further altercations. Although C1 denied that he was sexually propositioned by C2, there is insufficient evidence that staff developed an appropriate safety plan to protect C1 and other clients from C2 who had a known history of sexual assault and harrassment. Therefore the finding on this allegation is emended to \"unsubtantiated\" which means that although an allegation may be valid or true, there is not enough evidence to prove that it did occur.

The incident, which occurred on 01/26/2021, involved staff (S1), who took client's (C1's) blanket off of C1 in the morning, when C1 was refusing to get out of bed to get ready for school; this triggered C1 to approach S1 from behind, and wrap his arm around S1's neck. C1 later went to the kitchen and tore the fire extinguisher off of the wall and began to spray it in the living room. [See LIC Confidential Names List form (LIC811), dated 02/04/2021, for names.] LPA interviewed staff (S1), and client (C1), who both confirmed that S1 had taken C1's blanket off of C1 in the morning to help him get out of bed; this is a personal rights violation. It was reported that this method of waking-up C1 had occurred on more than one occasion, because C1 sometimes has a hard time waking up in the morning.

Interviews noted that some of the resident's property is kept locked in the office closet for safe keeping such as bigger electronics, skateboards, personal snacks, and allowance.

Although it was reported that clients (C1, C2, and C3) engaged in inappropriate behaviors during placement, confidential interviews denied observing the alleged misconduct between clients (C1, C2, and C3). Multiple confidential interviews reported that C1 and C3 displayed poor boundaries, and pertinent documentation provided to LPA reported that C1 had various incidents involving exhibitionism. However, confidential interviews, supported by documentation, reported staff was always present to address and redirect C1's behavior. Moreover, confidential interviews reported due to C1's behavior designated staff were assigned to provide increased supervision of C1. Information from confidential interviews also reported that C2 did not interact with C1 or C3. Furthermore, multiple confidential interviews denied a lack of supervision and reported that room visiting is not allowed, and staff conducted frequent room checks while on shift. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and documentation, the allegation that due to lack of care and supervision, minors (C1, C2, and C3) engaged in inappropriate interactions is unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "The investigation concluded that on 04/23/2024, C1 wrapped a jacket \"loosely\" around their (C1's) neck but did so in the presence of staff (S5), who was able to remove the jacket. Likewise, another agency investigated and found that Oak Grove's conduct \"was not harmful.\" Confidential documentation provided to LPA reported that C1 did make multiple suicidal statements and wrapped items around their neck on more than one occasion. The documentation also shows that the staff was aware of these attempts and intervened accordingly. However, another confidential interview provided conflicting information and reported that staff did not supervise C1. As a result, C1 was able to make multiple suicide attempts in C1's assigned bedroom or adjoining bathroom without the staff or others knowing. LPA was unable to corroborate this statement; furthermore, other confidential interviews reported that C1 was under various safety precautions while in care. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegation due to lack of supervision, a minor (C1) attempted suicide is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report and appeal rights were explained and given to Administrator, Tammy Wilson",

LPA Peete obtained documents pertinent to the investigation and interviewed facility staff (S1-S9) and Client 1 (C1). On 07/17/2024, Community Care Licensing received an allegation due to lack of supervision, a minor (C1) attempted suicide. There were concerns about two separate instances that occurred on 04/22/2024 and 04/23/2024. Based on the Special Incident Reports (SIR) provided to the Department on 04/22/2024, C1 called the \"988 hotlines\" and law enforcement (LE) and reported having \"urges to self-harm.\" On 04/23/2024, they (C1) repeated the same actions and, as reported on the SIR, disclosed to LE they (C1) attempted to \"choke\" themselves earlier in the day. Multiple confidential interviews reported that due to C1's history of unsafe behaviors, C1 was closely monitored and never left unsupervised. A confidential interview also reported the facility conducted an internal investigation into C1's claim of self-harm. UnsubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

LPA reviewed facility complaint history for the past year. During the investigation LPA conducted eleven confidential interviews, a facility inspection and collected Employee Work Schedule, House Rules, Strengths and Needs Plans, Social Worker Case Notes, SIRs, and Emergency Plan. All observations, confidential interviews, documentation, inspections were inconsistent with the reported allegations. The eleven confidential interviews revealed that the youth did engage in inappropriate activities, however there is no evidence to support that it was due to lack of Supervision of staff or their failure to protect the personal rights of the clients in care. The facility monitors the youth regularly and as defined in their work samples and record keeping. The youth have learned the supervision schedule and plan things between those times. The facility is aware of the youth's observations and have increased supervision and rotations of schedules to adapt to the needs of the youth, specifically during timeframes where checking on the youth is required. More staff are participating on check in's and adjusting schedules to ensure youth are healthy and safe.

The incident reported in part possible neglect/lack of supervision, as a youth in care sustained injuries to the head and elbow areas, resulting from a physical altercation with another youth in care. The incident was referred to CCL Investigations Branch for investigation. CCL Investigator, Douglas Real conducted the investigation including confidential interviews with four youth, two staff members and Facility Administrator. In addition, facility file history, incident reports and related medical reports were reviewed. Confidential interviews and documentary evidence revealed on 9/22/2024, two youth residents engaged in a physical altercation. Facility staff members were present during the altercation and verbally directed the youth to stop. At some point a third youth resident intervened pulling one youth away from the other. The two youth re-engaged with the physical altercation before stopping. Statements revealed complaints of youth having a hurt elbow and headache after falling during the altercation. A review of medical records indicated the youth's x-rays revealed no fractures or broken bones. Statements obtained from involved parties and witnesses, as well as record review, revealed a lack of evidence to prove neglect/lack of supervision resulting in a physical altercation between youth with injuries. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is determined Unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies cited per California Code of Regulations or Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) at this time.

Confidential interviews reported that C2 was placed in this facility as a minor and transitioned into adulthood during their placement. Confidential interviews reported that when C2 was a minor, they received permission from staff to visit C1's room. Confidential interviews reported that C1 and C2 never admitted to being in each other's beds. Confidential interviews reported that if C1 and C2 were discovered in each other's room, staff would redirect them to exit the bedroom. Confidential interviews reported that if C1 or C2 didn't comply, staff would directly supervise them outside the room, with the door open, until they complied. Confidential interviews reported that C1 and C2 were never permitted to be in each other's room, which was against facility rules. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegations that a resident (C2) in the home supplied another minor (C1) with marijuana and that facility staff are not adequately supervising a minor (C1) and other resident (C2) in the home may have occurred, however, is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report and appeal rights were explained and provided to Residential Coordinator Mayra Medina.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that minor was not afforded privacy while in care; specifically that on 9/14/2021, C1 was not given privacy for religious practices and staff excessively checked on C1, confidential interviews revealed that C1's religious practices include burning candles. Confidential interviews revealed on 9/14/2021, C1 was in C1's bedroom with the door closed performing religious practices that included burning a candle and staff was informed by another client that C1 was burning a candle. One confidential interview revealed that staff were checking on C1 excessively that day, while other interviews revealed staff were checking on C1 every 15 minutes as required. Interviews revealed that once S1 learned of the candle being burned, S1 went into C1's bedroom and informed C1 that C1 was not able to burn the candle in the room. Confidential interviews revealed that clients are not allowed to have glass candles or to burn candles in the STRTP for safety reasons. Confidential interviews also revealed that C1 is afforded privacy to practice their religion and is also offered alternate places to perform their religious practices. Regarding the allegations staff did not prevent a minor from self-harming, staff behavior poses as a risk to the minor while in care, and staff did not seek timely medical services for a minor; specifically that S1 minimized C1's threats to self-harm and staff denied C1 mental health care. Confidential interviews and record review revealed that also on 9/14/2021, C1 became upset for not being able to burn a candle in the STRTP and as a result C1 wanted to leave the STRTP on respite care or wanted to be hospitalized. Interviews also revealed C1 wanted to speak with mental health staff and was making self-harming statements. Interviews revealed C1 requested to speak to a mental health staff while others revealed C1 did not. Confidential interviews further revealed that S4 who is a mental health clinician spoke to and evaluated C1 and C1 did not meet the criteria to be hospitalized, as C1 had no plan to self-harm. Interviews revealed C1 then went into C1's bedroom, broke the glass candle jar and cut C1's self with the broken glass. Interviews revealed staff then contacted the sheriff and EMT services. Confidential interviews revealed staff did not do anything until C1 actually self-harmed while other interviews revealed that staff were looking for other options for C1 and also offering C1 other coping mechanisms, however C1 refused. Interviews also revealed no staff were heard belittling or minimizing C1's feelings or threats of harm. (Continued on LIC 9099-C) Regarding the allegation staff did not provide adequate transportation for a minor and staff demonstrated an inappropriate form of discipline, confidential interviews and record review revealed that on 9/5/2021, C1 was on a self-transporting community pass and called the STRTP and requested a ride back to the STRTP. Interviews revealed C1 asked S3 for a ride and S3 denied C1 a ride and ended the call. As a result, C1 found their own ride and arrived back to the STRTP late from the community pass. This interview further revealed that as a consequence, C1 had their community passes taken away for a couple days. Other interviews revealed C1 did call the STRTP while on a community pass after the time C1 was supposed to be back and informed S3 that C1 would be returning to the STRTP, however C1 did not request a ride home. Interviews revealed that C1 was dropped off late near the STRTP by an unknown male who was not authorized to drive C1. This interview revealed C1 had their community passes taken away for 3 days as a consequence. Several interviews revealed that losing community passes is a known consequence of coming home late. Based on confidential interviews and conflicting statements, the allegations C1 was not afforded privacy while in care, staff did not prevent C1 from self-harming, staff behavior poses as a risk to C1 while in care, staff did not seek timely medical services for C1, S3 did not provide adequate transportation for C1, and staff demonstrated inappropriate form of discipline, may have occurred however is not supported or proven by evidence.

Confidential interviews reported that while C1 was in C2's bedroom, C1 touched C2 inappropriately on C2's chest and groin area, and then C1 tried to choke C2 by grabbing their neck. Other confidential interviews reported that C2 was the one that inappropriately touched C1's chest and groin area and that it was C2 who grabbed C1's neck. Confidential interviews reported that S6 and S5 were able to separate C1 and C2 from the bedroom successfully. Confidential interviews reported that this incident was documented in a Special Incident Report. Confidential interviews also reported that a Police Report concluded that there was not enough evidence of inappropriate touching by any client (C1-C2). Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegation that lack of supervision resulting in a child (C1) inappropriately touching another child (C2) in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "C1 and C2 discharge paperwork disclosed that the removal of C1 and C2 was due to aggressive behaviors, and they no longer reside in the facility. The Department also received an allegation that staff do not prevent children (C1-C2) from bringing drugs, drug paraphernalia, and alcohol into the group home. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 and C2 would leave the facility without permission and would bring back vape pens and alcohol bottles upon return. Confidential interviews stated that staff (S1-S6) would conduct individual searches for C1 and C2 upon return of absence without permission due to a history of C1 and C2 bringing contraband into the facility. The history of substance abuse was noted on the Child and Family Team Meeting (CFT) held for C1 on 05/02/2023 and 07/14/2023 and for C2 on 05/11/2023 and 06/08/2023. Confidential interviews indicated that the individual searches consisted of searching C1 and C2's pockets, shoes, socks, and bags, conducting room searches, and perimeter checks. Confidential interviews disclosed that C1 and C2 would hide vape pens in their undergarment. In addition, confidential interviews revealed that staff (S1-S6) would request C1 and C2 to hand over contraband. If C1 and C2 refused to turn it in, staff would document it, supervise C1 and C2, and confiscate the contraband when it's safe and appropriate. The Department also received an allegation that staff (S4) were involved in a physical altercation with a youth (C2). Confidential interviews corroborated that staff did not engage in a physical altercation with any clients in care. Confidential interviews revealed that C2 was aggressive and physically assaulted S4, while S4 stepped back and S6 verbally redirected C2. Confidential interviews stated that staff use verbal crisis intervention according to their emergency intervention plan, which minimize the aggression C2 had toward S4. S4 removed self to allow C2 to calm down, and S6 continued to use emergency intervention procedures. Per the record review, the facility's early emergency intervention plan is to de-escalate the youth using verbal crisis intervention, identifying consequences, and voluntary self-isolation. Per record review, restraints are used as a last resort if needed. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegation that staff are not providing a safe environment for the child (C4) in care, staff do not prevent children (C1-C2) from bringing drugs, drug paraphernalia and alcohol into the group home, and staff (S4) were involved in a physical altercation with youth (C2) are unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On the above date, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Jessica Rubio arrived at Olive Crest Treatment Center - Wheeler (STRTP) to discuss records reviewed. LPA contacted Residential Manager David Owens via telephone. Mr Owens provided verbal authorization to deliver this report to Youth Care Specialist Aisea Tongilava. LPA reviewed April 2020 and May Medication Administration Record (MAR) log for C1 and discovered there were entries of medication refusals for C1's Fluoxetine recorded on 4/16/2020, 5/10/2020, and 5/24/2020. LPA reviewed the Special Incident Reports (SIR) that STRTP submitted to Community Care Licensing (CCL) during that time and no SIRs were submitted to CCL documenting C1 refused medication on those dates. LPA also discovered there was a blank entry on the MAR for 4/16/2020 for Melatonin. After LPA reviewed records it was determined that C1 was absent without leave (awol) at the time medication would have been administered however, there was no mention of the missed dose of medication written in the SIR reporting the awol nor was there another SIR submitted for the missed dose. The facility is being cited for Title General Regulation Section 80061 (b) (1) (E) Reporting Requirements. Based on record review the facility did not ensure C1's medication refusals or missed dose of medication due to awol were reported to CCL which poses a potential health, safety or personal rights risk to clients in care. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were provided to Youth Care Specialist Aisea Tongilava.",

    "narrative": "A confidential interview revealed staff did not care if C1 took C1's medication and also that S1 would not offer C1 their medication due to C1 refusing medication often. That same interview revealed that C1 asked S1 to take C1's medication however S1 did not provide it due to C1 refusing medication often. Other confidential interviews revealed there were no known issues with S1 withholding or not offering C1 medication. Record review revealed C1 was placed in the STRTP from 3/2/2020 - 5/27/2020 and was prescribed three different medications: Melatonin, Fluoxetine and Adderall. Record review indicated C1 started Melatonin and Fluoxetine on 4/8/2020 and Adderall on 5/16/2020. One confidential interview revealed it was believed there had been an issue with staff not obtaining C1's medication around April or May 2020 however, no additional details could be provided. Another confidential witness interview revealed blank entries on clients' MAR logs were often observed and appeared medication had not been provided to some clients, however, no observations were recalled regarding C1's MAR entries specifically. Other confidential interview revealed there was a lapse from when C1's Adderall was prescribed to when it was initially filled, however there were no missed doses once C1 began the medication. Additionally, a confidential interview and record review revealed that C1's Adderall was not started at the same time as the other medications due to C1 not being on any medication for several months prior. Record review corroborated and stated C1's treatment plan indicated re-initiating the medication as \"staggered and gradual\" to see how C1 adjusted to and was affected by the medication. Furthermore, CSW1 had no concerns of staff withholding medication from C1. At one point in April 2020, CSW2 was made aware by C1 that C1 was not yet receiving Adderall, however, CSW2 explained to C1 that it was likely due to the psychotropic medication evaluation process and C1's current assessment. Based on record review and conflicting statements, the allegation staff did not ensure minor received medications may have occurred however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were provided to Youth Care Specialist Aisea Tongilava.",

Youth #1 also reported that he believes that Youth #3 may have also been involved. A Suspected Child Abuse Claim was filed, the police were notified, and SIR was submitted. Youth #2 likes to AWOL a lot. He is in a very negative stated right now in his mind. And has been for the last year. He has just been wanting to go home so he has been having behavior issues. LPA asked Admin was happened before the youth AWOL'd from the facility. Admin reported; On Oct 28, Youth #1 had a court date and thought he was going to be released to his family member, but that did not happen. The family member is not ready for Youth #1 to come home just yet. The judge also encouraged the social worker to find a lower level of care for him, but Youth #1 does not want to go anywhere except with grandma. The other two (2) youth we don't have any issues with usually. This was their first time leaving the facility without permission. On 11/05/2022 all three (3) youths left the facility. When they returned Youth #1 told me that Youth #2 was doing sexual favors for vape pens, marijuana, and a place to sleep. I asked Youth #3 what happened while they were gone and he denied anything had happened. I contacted Child Protective Service Worker (CPS) , then Law Enforcement (LE). Youth #1 should me where they were staying and I let LE know. The next day LE went to the apartment and picked up Youth #2 and Youth #3 and brought them back to the facility. They were then interviewed by LE. None of the youth has disclosed any other information to me. continued on 809-C continued form We have a Case Manager at the Facility that will be working with the youth. They are also encouraged to come to us to talk if they need to as well as their counselors. We are going to move Youth #2 to another facility to see if that alleviates him and the other two (2) youth from leaving. We thought maybe the change of environment would be good for Youth #2 to help turn things around. The other two (2) youths we have had no issues leaving without permission, so moving Youth #2 may help them not leave. Facility took appropriate actions therefore no citations will be issued. Based on the information obtained through interview, there is no evidence of any Interim Licensing Violations. There were no deficiencies cited at this time, and a copy of this report was given to the facility representative.",

    "narrative": "Three clients reported a staff member solicited nude photos from one client who was Absent Without Leave (AWOL) from the facility. The facility was informed of the alleged solicitation, and promptly terminated the staff, who was already on leave for other unprofessional conduct. In addition to soliciting nude photos, the clients reported the staff member allowed the clients to use the staff member's cell phone to access social media, which went against facility policy. The staff member also visited a client while the client was AWOL, brought the client food, and took the client to the staff member's home. Per facility administration, the staff member did not notify the facility of being in contact with the AWOL youth, nor was the probation officer contacted regarding the client's location. Based on the preponderance of evidence that was met through interviews, observation, and record review, the allegation of: Staff solicited pornographic images from client is therefore SUBSTANTIATED.

On 10/30/2020, LPA Chad Cabigon contacted Bryce Inman, Facility Manager (S1) who stated that on 9/30/2020 he transported C1 home from school who was sitting in the back seat of the vehicle. S1 reported that C1 unbuckled his seatbelt and sat on the car's back window so that a good part of C1's body was out of the car while the car was moving. S1 stated he saw this out of the corner of his eye; this was on a two-lane road and \"there basically was no shoulder.\" S1 said it was important for him to stop the car anyway especially if people behind were going to see that a youth was hanging out of a car. LPA Cabigon asked how quickly S1 stopped the car after noticing that C1 was hanging out of the window and S1 stated, \"Seconds.\" LPA Cabigon also contacted C1 who recalled the incident and reported that S1 told him this was \"unsafe transportation.\" C1 said he proceeded to \"throw [his] body out the window\" and sat on the windowsill. C1 reported that S1 told him that he would have to call the facility supervisor if C1 persisted to leave his seatbelt off, and at that point C1 complied. C1 added that he usually does not put his seatbelt on because he does not like having a strap over his chest. LPA Cabigon asked if there was anything S1 could have done to prevent C1 from taking his seatbelt off or from positioning his body out of the moving vehicle; C1 replied, \"Not really because it was kind of my fault.\" On 2/10/2021, LPA Hillary Hall contacted C2 (see LIC Confidential Names List dated 10/30/20) and asked if he has seen clients take off their seatbelts during transport. C2 replied, \"Yes, sometimes. The staff just keep going.\" LPA Deaton reviewed S1's write-up for C1 regarding the unsafe behavior during transportation. There is no Serious Incident Report on file with CCLD regarding this incident. The facility has no documented history of C1 displaying unsafe behaviors during transport. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. This report will be sent to the facility via email with a return/read receipt requested. An Advisory Note for Best Practices has been attached to this LIC9099 regarding ILS Section 87065.5(g) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios.",

On 2/10/2021, LPA Hillary Hall contacted C2 (see LIC Confidential Names List dated 10/30/20) who said staff are not able to help him with schoolwork because they are too busy. On 2/11/2021, LPA Deaton contacted Debi Nunez, Administrator (S4) who stated the facility was \"getting a lot of refusals\" from C1 adding that he would tell staff he was not ready or did not want to participate when it came to distance learning. S4 said sometimes C1 would put his head down on the desk and would require a lot of prompting. S4 said the facility has no record of communications or requests to hold a Child & Family Team (CFT) Meeting to address C1's education with CSW1. LPA Deaton reviewed C1's Needs and Services Plan (NSP) dated 9/7/2020: C1 is experiencing a rating of 5 out of 10 for his schooling as shown by a history of truancy and poor grades - C1 will attend school in person, or online each school day; complete the assigned schoolwork each day; and ask for help, as needed. LPA Deaton reviewed the County Communications Log provided by CSW1 that documented on 9/8/20, CSW1 spoke with Tyson Poso, Administrator (S3) regarding concerns for C1's participation in online learning. S3 said C1 is now working in the administration building so that he can be fully supervised. LPA Deaton reviewed the School Attendance Record for C1 and found the following incidents that were not communicated to CSW1 by the facility: 9/9/20 - Distance Learning (DL) Unexcused Absence; 9/14/20 - (DL) Logged in at 9:35am; 9/15/20 - (DL) Logged in at 9am; 9/16/20 - (DL) Unexcused Absence, facility staff \"...were unaware he was not logged into class;\" 9/17/20 - C1 arrived to the school without his computer and other school supplies, staff was asked to return with the supplies, staff then left and circled the block and dropped C1 off again without the supplies; 9/21/20 - Logged in late, C1 told facility staff there was no school; 9/22/20 - Logged in late, staff reported that C1 was on his way to their office to get online; 9/28/20 - absent, staff \"could not give us the reason for his absence;\" 10/2/20 - Unexcused Absence; 10/5/20 - Unexcused Absence, facility said they were having issues with him at home [no Incident Report on file with CCLD]. LPA Deaton reviewed an SIR dated 9/14/20 that documented C1 was caught smoking marijuana; no corresponding County notification on file. Based on LPAs interviews which were conducted and record reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. Title Section 80061(f) and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS Version 3.1) Section 87061(d), Section 87078(b), and Section 87078(c) are being cited on the attached LIC9099-D pages.

Review of SIR indicated that C1 was put on a standing restraint by two (2) staff members after C1, who was placed on red flag by therapist, attempted to run out of the dorm. While in the restraint, C1 was transitioned to the ground by four (4) staff members due to C1's self-harming behavior by attempting to bang his head on the floor. One staff used a pillow to prevent any injury to C1's head. The restraint lasted for 25 minutes. C1 was released from the restraint as soon as it was determined that C1 is no longer threat to his own safety. Officer of the Day (OD) approved the prolonged restraint due to C1's red flag status as determined by the therapist. The Psychiatrist Mobile Response Team (PMRT) and police were called and arrived at the facility to assess C1. C1 was taken to the hospital for further assessment. C1's mother, county social worker (CSW) and the therapist were immediately notified of the incident. The restraint was reported timely to CCL and C1's placement agency. LPA reviewed the facility's Program Statement on Emergency Intervention. LPA found the restraint to be in accordance with the facility's Emergency Intervention Plan.
