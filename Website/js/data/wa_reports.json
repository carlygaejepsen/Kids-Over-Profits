Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: ¢ The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; ¢ The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; ¢ The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; ° The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: ¢ How the deficiency was corrected, ¢ The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), ¢ How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: ¢ Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? ¢ Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? | Na 1889 SS, | STATE OF WASHINGTON | DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH | PO Box 47874 » Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 | January 15, 2020 : Tim Shields : Bridges , PO Box 959 : Yakima, WA 98907-0959 : Subject: Inspection Number X2019-1160 Dear Mr. Shields, : The Washington State Department of Health conducted a recent inspection of Bridges, 201 S 2nd Ave, Yakima, WA, 98902-3464.The inspection was conducted on 12/04/2019.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; * The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; ¢ The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: ¢ How the deficiency was corrected, e¢ The completion date (date the correction was accomplished}, e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: ¢ Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? « Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? « is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? ° Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. | Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Review of the inventory lists for Resident #6 and #9 showed that they account for each resident's belongings on admission, but do not account for each resident's belongings on discharge. Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: eae! ¢ The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; ¢ The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; ¢ The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; ¢ The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: ¢ How the deficiency was corrected, « The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), ¢ How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates - The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. ~— Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: ¢ Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. * Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? * Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? ¢ Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? * Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? * Ifyou included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. aa Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. gov 02 2020 «iis gyseme oversiat Rem ah office of Healt =\" .

The men’s communal shower room had mold in the 2°, 3 and 4% shower stall and is in need of repair. The men’s communal shower room, shower stall 3 had the shower insert separating from the wall and is in need of repair. 2. Interview with Staff E on 02/12/2020 at 2:159m he reported that a work order for the door was submitted prior to this review. He reports that he will submit another work order to address other findings and he was not aware of this matter prior to review. Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Corrective action: Northwest Resources, Clinical Supervisor, Stancin Kahler investigated this finding and found that in our system, our eMAR program was set up to select “Taken”, which would mark the medication as the client took the medication and would deduct the medication from the med count. We had an option in our system for “Self-Administered” but this option was not set up to register as a medication was taken and did not track the med count when selected. Since the review, the “Self-Administered” option has been edited in our system to reflect the information pertaining to how the medication is administered and to reflect accurate data on the medication. Theresa Richards, Residential Program Manager will train all treatment attendant staff to select “Self- Administered” instead of “Taken” to reflect accuracy in our eMAR system and meet WAC 246-337- 105(5)(g).

Theresa Richards will complete training on the updated selection option in the eMar system by 09/30/2021. Theresa Richards will document training, who received training, and when training occurred for Corrective Action documentation.

Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions?

Educational posters were placed above the medication cart to serve as visual aide for 7-Rights processes. A remediation plan was also put in place to assist in training and educating nurses regarding medication errors. The nursing team has made a department-wide goal to reduce medication errors by 50% each quarter. This serves as collective buy- in from each nurse individually and as a whole. Q2-2020 is on track to meet this target. A remediation plan was put into place requiring a nurse to complete additional training measures if 2 medication errors are made within a 90-day period. The training plan will consist of completing a course or providing an educational vignette to nurses regarding medication administration during a staff meeting. The nurse will be required to re-certify medication administration protocols | with Nursing Director within 7 days of being placed on remediation plan. | Additionally, a deeper analysis of 2019 | medication error data will be completed at this time to gain further | understanding of trends. | In order to ensure sustained compliance, the Nursing Director will review the incident report binder daily. Any medication errors will be handled immediately with the nurse, by way of verbal coaching and guidance. The Medical Director is responsible to review all orders to ensure they are signed off within 72 hours. The Medical Director also created additional training to providers on signing off on orders and compliance with medication protocols and prescribing. Training will be completed for all prescribers by 04/15/2020, at which time medication policies will be reviewed with the nursing staff. The Nursing Director will review medication policies on a quarterly basis in face to face meetings (administration, storage, documenting, and errors).",

Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of | the deficiency to prevent recurrence. | Checklist: © Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? © Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? ef you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. | i 1889 Ss STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 e« Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 October 29, 2020 Dan Lauda, Administrator Northpoint Recovery",

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. - Ny fics S STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 March 22\" 2022 Joanna Shapiro, Administrator Pacific North Recovery Center LLC The Recovery Village Ridgefield 100 SE 34 Ave. Ste. 1800 Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394-0002 Subject: Survey Number X2021-1019 Dear Ms. Shapiro, The Washington State Department of Health conducted a Residential Treatment Facility examination of The Recovery Village Ridgefield, 888 S Hillhurst Rd, Ridgefield, WA. 98642-9063 by the Washington State Department of Health.

The kitchen ice maker storage unit vent was full of thick dust. Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them, and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should be worn when a staff member is interacting with a client who is in quarantine for known or suspected COVID-19. When droplet precautions are in place, Droplet Precaution Signage must be posted. B. Positive Client(s) In the event of a positive test, the facility will contact Compliance, and Compliance will contact the local health department and follow their guidance on specific actions steps related to the situation. Generally, best practice is for a COVID-positive resident to stay at the residential facility as long as symptoms remain mild and manageable at this level of care. Each facility has a site-specific protocol for managing illness and a sick client. When possible, a quarantined client should be the only person with access to his/her bathroom and should receive all meals and medications in their space. Clients in isolation will use designated indoor and outdoor spaces separate from other clients to contain spread of the virus and utilize technology for virtual therapy to supplement programing. Staff bringing the clients meals and medications should wear CDC-approved PPE. Discharge due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is determined by the Medical Director and logistical variables related to parent pick-up are taken into consideration. Parents are informed prior to admission of the possibility that their child may need to be picked up due to illness. C. Each location has a site-specific protocol for managing a sick client. The Executive Director is responsible for oversight. Ill. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) & OTHER SAFETY MEASURES A. Availability and Required Use 1. Every effort will be made to have PPE available at all facilities and the supply is to be distributed and monitored by the Executive Director or designee. The CDC is advising all facilities to implement strategies to conserve supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended that PPE is worn in the following circumstances: a. When droplet precautions are in place. Droplet Precaution Signage must also be posted. 3 b. When a staff member is interacting with a client who is in quarantine for known or suspected COVID-19. 3. PPEshould also be worn in accordance with normal infection control plan. 4. PPE will be prioritized for healthcare workers who are coming into direct contact with individuals with known or suspected COVID-19. 5. Medical staff that are hands-on with patients and for medical reasons need to violate social distancing practices to do their jobs can be provided a mask daily. 6. Staff involved in the care of clients with known or suspected COVID-19 should adhere to the CDC’s Standard, Contact, and Airborne precautions including eye protection, surgical masks, gowns, gloves, etc. These materials will be provided by Newport Academy to appropriate staff. 7. Clients with known or suspected COVID-19 should wear a surgical facemask when being evaluated medically and in the presence of others. 8. Items available: Gloves, masks, gowns, and goggles. N95 Respirators, which are needed for aerosol generating procedures that are not performed at Newport Healthcare, can be worn by staff but are not necessary in our environment. 9. Effective 2/2/2021, all staff providing direct care at sites with positive cases, confirmed Covid-19+ clients, and clients who are known to be exposed are encouraged to “double mask” and wear a disposable medical mask under a cloth mask. 10. Frequently Asked Questions about Personal Protective Equipment from CDC B. Face Coverings The CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere around other people. Effective 2/2/2021, masks are required on planes, trains, buses, and other forms of public transportation in the United States.1 Newport Healthcare staff wear face coverings while at work even when this is not mandated by a state or local mandate. Exceptions to this include when working alone in an office, taking a break for eating or drinking when alone, and performing duties outdoors when social distancing (maintaining 6 feet of distance between one another) is possible. Failure to comply with this guidance will result in appropriate action including verbal and written warnings. C. Physical Distancing All Newport staff and clients will strive to maintain 6 foot distancing whenever possible during the course of treatment and work day, especially during high risker periods such as meals when masks must be removed. In controlled environments such as the classroom, group room, and van transport, a 3 foot distance (shoulder to shoulder) is permitted to enhance access to treatment and academics during Covid-19 per CDC guidance? under the following conditions: - All staff and clients ensure 100% mask compliance - All chairs and seating is oriented to prevent direct face to face exposure - (Clients and staff are screened for symptoms each day prior to programming - Structured or assigned seating to mitigate exposure risk - Parental approval and advance screening measures required for van transport * Your Guide to Masks, 2/2/2021 and Understanding the Difference Between Surgical Masks and Respirators * https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html 4 IV. COMMUNICATION AND REPORTING POLICIES The Newport Healthcare COVID-19 Task Force convenes daily to review protocols, plans, and communication. Determinations are made for how to effectively communicate internally and externally. Newport’s Senior Director of Communications oversees outgoing messaging and communication. The Task Force works with local operators to review the effectiveness of this protocol and make adjustments as necessary. The Director of Compliance will log test results (negative or positive) from clients and the local HR representative will log test results for employees. The Compliance department will oversee communication with all local health departments. The Compliance Officer will monitor the CDC and other official sources regularly for updated guidelines and recommendations. The Leadership Team will discuss allocation of resources and finances to deal with prevention and response, messaging to stakeholders, and contingency plans. V. EMPLOYEE EXPOSURE PROTOCOL A. PURPOSE: Our goal is to provide a safe work environment for our employees while providing continuing care for our clients for whom we are responsible. The purpose of this policy is to communicate the appropriate protocols so that we can implement them in a fair and consistent manner while working to keep everyone safe. B. POLICY: We follow current CDC guidance and considerations related to exposure to COVID-19. 1. Fully vaccinated individuals are not required to quarantine following exposure to COVID-193. Vaccinated persons should continue to follow current guidance including wearing a face covering, avoiding crowds, practicing social distancing, and washing hands frequently. 2. Excluding fully vaccinated people and those who have had COVID-19 in the past 3 months and recovered and do not develop new symptoms, the following individuals must quarantine following close contact and exposure to COVID-19: e Any individual who lives with someone who is under investigation or awaiting testing for COVID-19 must remain at home until the test results come back negative. If test results come back positive, follow guidance under next point. e Any individual who has been directly exposed to someone who has tested positive with COVID-19 within the past 14 days, with whom the employee has been living, been an intimate partner, or provided care, or with whom the employee has had prolonged contact without both parties wearing a face covering (defined by the public health department as within 6 feet for 15 cumulative minutes or more over 24 hours), should quarantine and monitor symptoms daily. Quarantine can end after day 10 if there are no symptoms or after day 7 if the individual has a negative test between day 5 and day 7. 3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance. html 5 The individual should self-monitor and practice masking through day 14. More details are outlined in Section VI. e Employees who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g.: sore throat, cough, fever, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, or shortness of breath) must refrain from coming to work until they have been symptom- free for a period of 24 hours (no fever without taking fever-reducing medicine) and have had at least 10 days since their symptoms appeared, whichever is later. e Employees who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 must refrain from coming to work until they have been symptom-free for a period of 24 hours (no fever without taking fever-reducing medicine) and have had at least 104 days since their symptoms appeared, whichever is later. The company will follow the guidance of the local health department and the CDC regarding notification, management, and reporting of positive employee cases. When new guidance from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is provided, we will adjust this policy as needed in alignment with this guidance. Should an issue arise within one of our programs, we will work directly with the local department of public health to best manage the situation. The Task Force that has been established within Newport is monitoring each program daily and will adjust program schedules as needed. C. PROCEDURE: Employees exposed to COVID-19 as defined above, or who have a temperature of 100.4 or higher, or who are showing any symptoms of COVID-19, should report to their manager or Human Resources that they will not be coming to work. Your manager or someone from HR may inquire whether you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms if you report feeling ill at work or if you call in sick. The information obtained will only be shared with HR but will allow us to know how to best protect you, our clients, and the workplace. To reduce COVID-19 exposure and transmission, all employees are expected to abide by current COVID-19 safety precautions including wearing a face covering, frequent and thorough hand washing/sanitizing, and social distancing. Time and Attendance As an essential business, we have clients for whom we are responsible, so your attendance on site as an essential employee is critical during this time period in order for us to maintain a safe and healing environment for them. Remote Work The majority of the company’s workforce is needed onsite to provide direct care to our clients and therefore the option to work remotely is limited for most. If a request to work from home is made, the position will be evaluated to determine if the individual can work remotely * On August 10, 2020, CDC updated return to work guidance https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/hcp/return-to-work.html; also see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are- sick/quarantine.html (updated 12/2/2020) 6 (dependent upon the individual’s ability to successfully perform their essential job duties on a remote basis, and the technical requirements associated with the role). Travel Non-essential business-related travel plans should be cancelled. All other travel should be reviewed with your supervisor to determine if it is mission critical. D. EMPLOYEE SCREENING Employee screening may be implemented at the facility level utilizing the plan identified at each facility. The Employee Screening Tool should be used (see page 9). VI. EXPOSURE AND RETURN TO WORK OR PROGRAMMING GUIDANCE A. See above Employee Exposure Protocol (V, B, 1) for criteria related to employee quarantine. B. For individuals who do not meet the criteria listed above following exposure to COVID-19, the CDC approves the following alternatives to shorten the recommended 14-day quarantine?: 1. 10 days - Ifno symptoms have been reported during daily monitoring, quarantine can end after 10 days 2. 7 days -Ifno symptoms have been reported during daily monitoring, and a negative test is performed within 48 hours of the anticipated end of quarantine, then quarantine can end at 7 days. Quarantine cannot end sooner than 7 days. In both scenarios, masking and symptom monitoring through day 14 are required. Should any symptoms appear at any point, the individual should self-isolate and notify their health care provider.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Findings included: During the facility review on 07/29/2021 at approximately 10:00 am, the reviewer observed the following: 1. The intake bathroom had soiled linen from prior use, the trash was full, and the shower and sink had not been cleaned or sanitized. The intake bathroom lacked overall cleanliness. 2. During the interview with Staff A (Safety Officer) and Staff B (Team Lead) it was reported that the facility has limited staff. Staff are responsible for cleaning the bathroom area when they complete an intake. Staff are also responsible for meeting resident needs which takes priority. The reviewer asked for clarity on the implemented procedure and discussed the possibility of infectious control issues if not addressed per the procedure and in a timely manner. 3. The space used for storing emergency food supply lacked cleanliness. There appeared to be a large amount of coffee that had leaked into the cabinet below. The spill area had dried brown and boxes absorbed the liquid and appeared to have dried. It appeared to be there for a period. 4. During the interview with Staff A (Safety Officer) it was reported that the prior coffee machine would leak and often residents would spill coffee when using it. The facility has replaced the machine but was not aware that it had leaked below into dry storage possibly contaminating supplies. There was no indication of when the dry storage was last inspected by the agency. Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: ¢ Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e lf you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

P&P and Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Attachments: None 3/31/2022 reviewed approved Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. = i 1889 Ss STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 e Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 March 31, 2022 Joe Roszak Kitsap Mental Health Services",

Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: 8. Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. 9. Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? 10. Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? 11. Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? 12. Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? 13. If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. @ < BE TESS Re 1389 S, STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 September 14, 2021 Maggie Hostnick Downtown Emergency Services 515 Third Ave Seattle, Washington 98104 Subject: Inspection Number X2021-257/641/642/643/644 Dear Ms. Hostnick, The Washington State Department of Health conducted an inspection at Downtown Emergency Services Main, Wall Street, James Street, Crisis Solution Center BHA/RTF.

You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction.

Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame.

Completion Dates : The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged pian to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: ¢ Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. . ¢ Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? © Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e seach plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e¢ Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? | e lf you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. _—-EXHIBIT A | 22 Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations — Skills Coach Training Checklist Skills Coach: Training Check List Initial Onboarding Reviews (PSS Trainer) Procedural Duties |.

Our Skills Coaches are the people who spend the most time with our residents during their stay here and are key members of the treatment team. The Skills Coach is responsible for the safety of each and every resident and has a duty to help provide a therapeutic environment for the residents to progress through their treatment. A copy of the job description is attached at the conclusion of this manual. The job description, however, is just the outline of your duties. The most important part of the job is that you remain, at all times, an Active Skills Coach.

If the resident tells staff of an-issue in need of assessment, report this in the Hatus Report. Respect and protect the privacy and confidentiality of resident’s medications, in doing so, only one (1} resident at a time should be at the med window for med monitoring at a time. This will allow the Skills Coach to ensure proper monitoring and documentation has occurred. There will be identified individuals in each shift responsible for monitoring meds for their clan. These are people who understand and are comfortable in giving the medication and understanding the importance of proper monitoring and documenting. On Calls are not to monitor meds. Medication Schedule begins at 0800 and 2000 (8am and 8pm). Monitoring of Medications 5 “RIGHTS”: 1. Right RESIDENT 2. Right MEDICINE 3. Right DOSE 4. Right TIME 5.

Obtain ail boxes for the wing you are monitoring from the med cart (girls on the left side, boys on the right side in the second drawer down). The resident’s name and photograph, along with all | medication information will be on the back of the box. When obtaining boxes from cart, choose the boxes that correspond to the time you are monitoring meds — example: If you are doing morning meds, pull all boxes from med cart that have medications in the “MORNING” slot. If you are doing evening, pull all boxes that have medications in the “EVENING” slot. 2. Provide at least 1 Dixie cup of water for each resident receiving medications. 3. When the resident is at the window, assist the resident to open the slot for the day that you are assisting with, and have them put the medication in their hand. It is best to have the resident put their hand through the window so that you can directly observe the resident’s medication go into their hand. You may offer the resident a paper medication cup if you choose, instead of dumping into their hand. , 4. The resident then consumes the medication. You MUST keep the medication in your eye sight at all times from the time you give the resident the med box until the time that the medication is consumed. You must positively confirm the medication has been : consumed. if you believe, for any reason, that the resident is “cheeking” the medication or did not swallow the medication, keep the resident under direct observation, have another skills coach provide 8-12 ounces of water, and assure the resident “rinses” their mouth and swallows. Do not allow the resident out of your sight until you are certain the medication has been consumed. If you suspect cheeking, after having the resident consume the extra water, notify the nurse by email. 5. Document on the Hatus report who assisted the residents with medications for the shift. PRN Medications: (Must be done by a “trained” medication monitoring skills coach) A PRN med is one that can be taken “as needed”, not routinely every day. All PRN meds MUST be documented REMEMBER: 1. ALL med sheets must be signed on the back with your name and initials. There are new med sheets created at the beginning of each month. 2. ALL boxes on the MAR MUST be initialed to document that meds were taken or refused 3. Follow instructions from Nurse on disposing of meds that have fallen on floor 4. Do not touch pills with your fingers Additional Information on Medication Monitoring 1. When finishing monitoring meds, go back and recheck every sheet that you have initialed 2. EVERY BOX must have initials 3. Circle initials and write reason med not given on back if resident did not get the med 4. EVERY med sheet must be SIGNED WITH YOUR SIGNATURE and INITIALS ON THE BACK © Best practice is to sign every sheet at the beginning of the month every month! Medical, Dental and Vision appointments Skills Coaches will only be transporting residents to appointments if approved through their supervisor. There are some instances when Skills Coaches will be asked to assist with a transport. Transports to appointments are normally done by the Healing Lodge skills coach. 1. Keys 2. Van checkout 3. Vehicle inspection 4. Required medical paperwork and directions 5. Check in resident/ sit with resident during visit 6. Bring back all medical paperwork and put in Nurse box. If you are going to be assisting with a transport a packet envelope will be placed in Fast Track by the computer or in your box. You will also be notified by your supervisor. At the day of appointment the envelope goes with the resident to the appointment and is given to the front desk receptionist at check in by staff member. Staff accompanying the resident needs to ensure the provider fills out the bottom section PROVIDER’S ORDERS and signs it before leaving the office/clinic. Paperwork is returned to © the NURSE box in Fast Track. Emergency Situations (Fire, evacuation, medical ect.) Fire Make sure you are up to date on fire drill procedures.

Your role in the provision of medical care is to follow the instructions of the nurse. Some situations will call for you to use judgment on how severe a medical condition is. Below is a general guideline to help you in making decisions: EMERGENCY: A situation that exists where the condition is so severe that if you do nothing, the resident may die. Example: Resident stops breathing, choking, etc. CALL 911 Immediately, have other staff notify Nurse, whether on site or during off hours. Notify key administrative staff. Do NOT delay care to notify nurse or administrative staff. URGENT: A situation that exists where if you do nothing, the condition will turn into an EMERGENCY. Example: A broken exposed bone, a sudden allergic response (hives, etc.) A wound that you cannot control bleeding on. NOTIFY THE NURSE IMMEDIATELY, 24 hours per day. If you do not hear back from the nurse within 15 minutes, call your supervisor. ROUTINE: A situation that may be uncomfortable, but is not life threatening, and will not become life threatening. Example: Headaches, toothaches, twisted ankle, jammed fingers, sore throat, fever less than 103 degrees orally, muscle cramps, aches pains, etc. Call the nurse during regular office hours, or if after hours/weekend, email the nurse. Please be mindful that our young people may not want to participate in treatment related activities, and may use a medical complaint as an excuse to not participate. Frequently, they will state that - they have thrown up, or have diarrhea, etc. Any emesis (throw up), diarrhea, bleeding, etc. MUST be observed by staff. There is no need to “save” it, but when communicating with the Nurse or Administrative Staff, they will want to know if it was observed or simply reported. Showering In/Searches From Off Units Prior to going on off unit be sure to place appropriate amount of towels in shower room for the return. Upon returning to facility escort residents in the proper resident movement to the lobby then to shower hall way. Call for additional staff as needed for proper monitoring and ratio.

After shower is completed if possible escort showered resident to wing, if not possible keep them completely separate from the unshowered residents by placing them at the end of the hall towards admissions. The showered in residents are placed at the opposite end of the hallway with a skills coach in the middle of the hallway. Repeat process until all residents are showered. Be sure to check the shower before each resident enters for any hidden contraband. If resident is not compliant and is in contact with non-searched area/ or non-showered resident they will be required to repeat, and shower in again. . 1. Pre-Search the shower stall to verify that it is free of contraband. 2. Have the resident then enter the shower stall and close the curtain once they enter.

Instruct the resident to remove “ALL” items of clothing and hand them out to the staff member that is performing the search. 4. Have the resident then take a brief shower (2-3 minutes). | . 5. While the resident is showering the staff member will perform a thorough search of the resident’s clothes. 6. Once the water is turned off hand a towel to the resident and instruct them to dry off. 7. Once they finish drying off instruct them to secure the towel either around their waist or chest depending upon which gender is being searched. 8. Once the towel is secure instruct them to open the shower curtain. Ask the resident to open their hands and mouth to ensure that they do not have any contraband in either of the two. Then have the resident step out of the shower while you conduct a quick search of the stall to ensure that they did not hide any contraband during their shower. Once you have inspected the stall then provide the resident with their clothes and allow them back in to the stall so they can get dressed.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. @ < BE TESS Re 1889 S, STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 November 8, 2021 Ron Simpson Sunshine Terrace",

Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. @) <a HES RE 1889 S, STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 November 19, 2021 Thomas L Cook Sun Ray Court PO Box 4627 Spokane, WA 99220-0627 Subject: Inspection Number X2021-715 Dear Mr. Cook, The Washington State Department of Health conducted an onsite Inspection of Sun Ray Court, 518 S Browne St, Spokane, WA. 99204-2315.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

          "findings": "Based on interview and inspection of the facility, the facility failed to maintain hot water temperatures between 100 and 120 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the facility. Failure to maintain proper hot water temperatures in the facility may result in negative resident/staff outcomes. Findings included: During the inspection of the facility, the surveyor noted the following hot water temperatures: 1. Kitchen prep sink-88.3 degrees F 2. Bathroom sinks between 70-85 degrees F 3. On 02/22/2022 at 11:00am interview with Staff A, Agency Administer, verified below standard water temperatures throughout the facility. Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. Kesar.

Your plan of correction must be. submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them, and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency. e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited. e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective, and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements. e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coincides with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable timeframe. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report, you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Responsible Person(s): Associate Vice President Director of RTFs Clinical Supervisor Facility Manager Completion Date: 6/17/22 Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Responsible Person(s): Associate Vice President Director of RTFs Facility Manager Completion Date: 7/31/22 Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. y Health oo Compass Health Corrective Action Plan Department of Health — Compass Health Whatcom Triage 7/21/22",

During the inspection of the facility, the surveyor observed on 07/20/2022 at 12:05 PM, emergency evacuation signs were not posted in resident rooms, common areas, or near emergency exits. It is recommended that the facility post these signs to mark routes to the nearest emergency exit in the event of an emergency. In addition, it is suggested that the locations of fire extinguishers in the facility be indicated on the posted evacuation plans. 2. During the review this was discussed with the clinical manager, the explanation was that the contractor who managed the building stated that they did not need the evacuation routes posted due to the type of building. This reviewer informed the clinical manager that the signs are required by the Washington Administrative Code.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Pe Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. @) <a HES x 1889 S, STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 March 1, 2023 Jeff Thomas FBH Foothills Evaluation and Treatment 107 South Division Street Spokane, WA 99202 Subject: Inspection Number X2022-675 Dear Mr. Thomas, The Washington State Department of Health conducted an onsite Inspection of FBH Foothills Evaluation and Treatment, 505 E North Foothills Dr, Spokane, WA. 99207- 2101.

An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Kitchen operations are a shared function with the Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e seach plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. - xe fs Y STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 May 15, 2023 Claudia DAllegri Sea Mar Turning Point Adult Residential Center 113 23rd Ave S Seattle, WA 98144-2309 Subject: Inspection Number X2022-209 Dear Ms. D’Allegri, The Washington State Department of Health conducted an inspection at Sea Mar Turning Point Adult Residential Center.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective, and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish corr ection; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If youincluded any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e Howthe deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish corr ection; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring | Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency wil! be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If youincluded any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC ; Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coincides with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

P , Responsible: Clinical Lead Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. 2) <a HES RE 1880 S, STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 May 30, 2023 Rebecca Crocker The Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations",

Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish corr ection; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? | Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC wil! be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

          "findings": "reviewed (Staff E, H, K, and O). Rule Reference. WAC 246-337-050 Narrative. The Deficiency quotes WAC 246-337-050(7)(f): The licensee shall have written documentation for each staff member including: (f) Current license, certification, or registration, if applicable. This deficiency is in reference to a registered agency affiliated counselor (AAC), which credential requires no education or experience. The report cites four staff members with pending AAC registrations for more than 90 days that are either a Behavioral Health Technician (BHT) or Psychiatric Security Attendant (PSA). American Behavioral Health Systems, Inc. (ABHS) believes the Department of Health (DOH) survey report citing a deficiency for an AAC registration credential in pending status past 90 days should be a recommendation for a number of reasons. First, BHTs and PSAs do not meet the DOH definition as an AAC or provide counseling as defined by DOH. Second, despite these positions not meeting DOH definitions, ABHS determined some ABHS positions should still have an AAC so that those positions are covered under the uniform disciplinary act. BHTs and PSAs are two of those positions. Third, the DOH surveyor understood that DOH was now processing credentials within 30 days of application and payment which is not consistent with our experience. We believe our experience with the DOH credentialing process is not unique to ABHS but rather a systems issue at DOH. BHTs and PSAs Do Not Meet the DOH Definition of AAC or Provide Counseling ABHS BHTs & PSAs do not meet the DOH definition for an AAC and do not provide counseling per the DOH definition. The DOH definition of agency affiliated counselor: “Agency affiliated counselor” means a person registered, certified, or licensed under this chapter who is employed by an agency or is a student intern, as defined by the department.” DOH definition of counseling: WAC 246-811-010: (6) \"Counseling\" means employing any therapeutic techniques including, but not limited to, social work, mental health counseling, marriage and family therapy, and hypnotherapy, for a fee, that offer, assist, or attempt to assist an individual or individuals in the amelioration or adjustment of mental, emotional, or behavioral problems, and includes therapeutic techniques to achieve sensitivity and awareness of self and others and the development of human potential. 2 Definition of Counseling: WAC 246-810-010: (7) \"Counseling\" means employing any therapeutic techniques including, but not limited to, social work, mental health counseling, marriage and family therapy, and hypnotherapy, for a fee that offer, assist, or attempt to assist, an individual or individuals in the amelioration or adjustment of mental, emotional, or behavioral problems, and includes therapeutic techniques to achieve sensitivity and awareness of self and others and the development of human potential. Per ABHS job descriptions: e BHT: The Behavioral Health Technician will be responsible for providing support to clients with co-occurring disorders in a treatment facility... A successful BHT will have excellent communication skills, be reliable, and demonstrate critical thinking skills. Responsibilities include monitor clients for changes in behavior and report to supervisor, maintain order and safety in the treatment facility, provide building security, respond to client needs and concerns. e PSA: Provide security to ABHS and its clients receiving treatment services from alcohol and/or drugs in an inpatient environment... Responsibilities include monitor ABHS’ clients for behavioral changes or inappropriate behavior under the supervision of management on duty, demonstrate effective critical thinking and other problem-solving skills, accurately convey and document client behavior and status, intervention use, client response and client progress both verbally and in writing to clients and members of the treatment team. ABHS Determined Some Positions That Do Not Meet the DOH Definition of AAC or Provide Counseling Should Still Be Covered by the Uniform Disciplinary Act. ABHS management staff members support and require staff members that provide counseling and do not otherwise hold a DOH credential to have and maintain an AAC credential such as a Mental Health Professional. Despite BHTs and PSAs not meeting DOH definitions, ABHS still determined some ABHS positions should still have an AAC so that those positions are covered under the uniform disciplinary act. As DOH begins the transition to Registered AAC, Certified AAC, and Licensed AAC, because BHT and PSA positions do not require a bachelor’s or master’s degree, will ABHS still be able to secure a RAAC for these types of positions to bring them under the Uniform Disciplinary Act? DOH Credentialing is Not Processing AAC Applications or Following Its Procedure Described on the AAC Website. The DOH surveyor at ABHS Parkside on July 19, 2023, indicated that DOH was processing AAC credentials within 30 days. ABHS contacted the DOH credentialing customer service line on July 20, 2023, and the pre-recorded voice message indicated DOH was processing credential applications received and whose checks had cashed on May 3, 2023. DOH is at least 2.5 months behind in processing credentials. The DOH website says: Per WAC 246-810-015 if you apply for this (AAC) credential within 30 days of employment, you may provide counseling or services within the scope of practice for the AAC credential for which you applied, while your application is processed. The department will review the application and if further information is required it will issue a letter listing the deficiencies. The applicant will have 90 days from the date of the deficiency letter to provide all necessary documentation. If the 3 required documentation is not received by the department within 90 days, the applicant must stop working until the credential is issued. ABHS employees do not receive a notice from DOH when, “... further information is required it will issue a letter listing the deficiencies.” DOH accepts AAC applications along with payments, posts the application as pending, provides no follow up per its procedure posted online, and in some cases, allows the application to ultimately be closed resulting in reapplication, paying fees again plus a late fee. ABHS expected DOH to follow its guidance under WAC 246-810-015(3)(a) Applicants must submit an application to the department within the first thirty days of employment at an agency in order to continue working while the application is processed. (b) Applicants must complete any outstanding deficiencies within ninety days of the date the department issues a deficiency letter. If the applicant does not satisfy the outstanding licensure requirements within ninety days, the applicant must stop working. ABHS is not aware that DOH has issued any deficiency letters to staff members applying and paying for an AAC credential. How the deficiency will be corrected and who is responsible. Caroll Opel, ABHS Parkside administrator and the ABHS Parkside human resources staff member will complete the following activities so that these positions are covered by the Uniform Disciplinary Act. e ABHS Parkside audited all positions deemed necessary to have an AAC credential. e Contacted the DOH credentialing customer service line to determine what documents DOH needs to complete credentialing because DOH did not issue deficiency letters. e Submitted documents DOH requests to complete pending AAC applications. e Is continuing to call DOH frequently and document if/when DOH credentialing does not follow up with staff and the 90-day time frame is approaching. e Will conduct a human resource audit for AAC application submission within 30 days of employment for new staff members. e Document all contacts with DOH so ABHS can provide DOH survey staff members with accurate information about DOH processing credentialling applications. Timing of Corrections. ABHS completed its audit of all staff members at ABHS Parkside that we required to have an AAC credential on July 20, 2023. Staff members with pending applications began contacting and documenting DOH credentialing requests for additional information on July 20, 2023. Staff members are documenting what additional information DOH requested and submitted employment verification when requested on July 20 and July 21, 2023. ABHS staff members are continuing to contact DOH credentialing weekly to determine the status of each staff member’s pending application. 4 Monitoring & Assurances. ABHS Parkside management and ABHS corporate human resources representatives are to conduct monthly and quarterly review of HR files for all ABHS employees, completing check lists to ensure all employees hold appropriate DOH credentials. Special attention will focus on pending AAC applications and the status of those pending AACs approaching 90 days. Results of HR file audit reviews are documented by the Corporate Compliance Department with results distributed to ABHS facility administrators for correction when necessary. 5 2) << Bese x 1889 S, STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PO Box 47874 « Olympia, Washington 98504-7874 August 3, 2023 Caroll Opel American Behavioral Health Systems - Parkside PO Box 141106 Spokane Valley, WA 99214-1106 Subject: Inspection Number X2023-387 Dear Ms. Opel, The Washington State Department of Health conducted an onsite Inspection of of American Behavioral Health Systems — Parkside, 1230 Monitor Street, Wenatchee, WA 98801-3534 .

Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. “A Health Compass Health Corrective Action Plan Aurora House 11.9.23 Corrective Action Submitted 1.4.24 Date",

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them, and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency. e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited. e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective, and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements. e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coincides with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable timeframe. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e Ifyou included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report, you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.

In Progress: Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e ls each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor. izes ON co STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 2/21/2024 Evergreen Recovery Centers - Legacy Lodge",

Since the last Department of Health (DOH) RTF survey on April 25, 2022, ABHS has continued to address similar facility issues that most RTFs deal with on a monthly basis. Depending on the acuity of clients — much more acute in 2023 and 2024 — individuals in need of behavioral health treatment services create facility environmental and treatment challenges. ABHS Mission addressed and repaired all of the findings documented in the April 25, 2055 DOH RTF survey, detailed in ABHS’ May 26, 2022 Plan of Correction (“May 26, 2022 POC”). ABHS Mission maintenance staff members continually work on repairing or replacing chipped floor tiles and providing carpet shampoo and carpet maintenance. As discussed in detail below, ABHS discontinued using white grout within its facility some time ago. As noted in the May 26, 2022 POC, the grout previously cited by DOH as dirty was black grout and did not have mold present. Like other RTFs, ABHS spent the majority of 2022 and 2023 dealing with the pandemic. ABHS spent about $30,000 per month for Covid 19 testing and supplies. During that time, ABHS would have preferred to spend those funds on new floor tiling, carpeting, and other maintenance items, however, ABHS had to prioritize pandemic related expenses to ensure ABHS could keep its doors open for its clients. ABHS allocated funds for emergency maintenance issues during that time. Now that the pandemic has ebbed, ABHS Mission is moving forward with facility remodel planning during the remainder of 2024, and its Remodel Plan for 2024 includes: 1. ABHS submitted a DOH Construction Review Services application March 22, 2024, to remodel the ABHS Mission kitchen equipment and floor coverings. We anticipate this capital expenditure project to be completed about June 1, 2024. That project budget equals $73,668.00. 2. ABHS will finish remodeling client rooms 13 and 31. These two rooms require new carpet and tile. We anticipate completion of this work early in the third quarter of 2024. 3. ABHS will replace the carpet and tile in conjoint client bathrooms in G Hall. This project includes 5 bathrooms. We anticipate completion of this work late in the third quarter of 2024. 4. ABHS will replace carpet and tile in conjoint client bathrooms in F Hall. This project includes 9 bathrooms. We anticipate completion of this work in the fourth quarter of 2024. How The Deficiency Will Be Corrected And Who Is Responsible. Tyler Prutsman, ABHS Mission Administrator, and Wayne Dawson, Director of Facilities for ABHS Mission, are both responsible for corrections identified herein. 3 Timing of Corrections In addition to the ABHS Mission Remodel Plan for 2024 detailed above, Mr. Prutsman and Mr. Dawson addressed facility maintenance and repairs described below. Monitoring & Assurances Mr. Dawson and ABHS Mission’s maintenance and housekeeping staff members are using and documenting the results of a 15- point room inspection audit template, which Mr. Dawson implemented in May 2022, to ensure routine inspections are conducted monthly. In addition, ABHS is using the Facilities RTF Maintenance Audit Checklist, and will ensure this audit is done twice per year. Mr. Prutsman will review the results of the room inspections. Mr. Dawson will take appropriate action when needed to ensure compliance with WAC 246-337-120(1). Mr. Dawson will share results with the ABHS Executive Management Team responsible for authorizing facility repairs and improvements. Finding 1. Review of policy and procedures (P&P) titled, “American Behavioral HealtSh systems, Inc. (Mission Branch) Subject: Treatment Facility Requirements, Safety and Security,” policy number 4.0, updated 01/02/23, showed the agency failed to ensure “all floors will be kept free of debris and maintained in a safe condition.” Response: As noted above, ABHS Mission maintenance staff members continually work on repairing and replacing chipped floor tiles, routine shampoo and carpet cleaning, and carpet maintenance. Findings 2. a. — 2. k. in the March 14, 2024, Inspection Report are specifically discussed below, a. The rug in “T hall” room 88 was pulled up from the floor creating a tripping hazard. Response: After discovering that the floor tile was raised, ABHS Mission maintenance staff glued the tile to secure it. This potential tripping hazard at the carpet seam has been repaired. b. Chipped floor tiles with chunks out of tiles in copy room used to provide clients Suboxone and observation after dose. RECURRENT DEFICIENCY from last review period 04/25/22. Response: ABHS Mission was not cited for “chipped floor tiles with chunks out of tiles” in the copy room during RTF survey X2021-912 on April 25, 2022. Therefore, this cannot be a “recurrent deficiency.” ABHS is aware that floor tiles and carpet need continuous replacement and has developed a comprehensive remodel plan to address these types of facility issues, as outlined above. c. Dirty grout in the “F hall” shower room. RECURRENT DEFICIENCY from last review period 04/25/22. 4 Response: As noted in the May 26, 2022 POC for RTF survey X2021-912, the F hall shower has ceramic tile with black grout. There was no mold detected in the shower room in F hall March 25, 2024. This cannot be a “recurrent deficiency” under the circumstances. d. Broken sheet rock in the bathroom of “F hall” room 56. Response: Clients ripped out a towel hook in room 56 which left a small hole from the molly bolt in the wall. ABHS repaired the hole in room 56 of the F hall on March 25, 2024. e.

RECURRENT DEFICIENCY from last review period 04/25/22. How The Deficiency Will Be Corrected And Who Is Responsible. ABHS is no longer able to purchase florescent T-8 or T-12 bulbs. ABHS began replacing these florescent bults with direct wire, LED bulbs which no longer require fitted shields. New LED bulbs are shatter proof. ABHS 1s installing direct wire LED bulbs as current, existing florescent bulbs burn out. Tyler Prutsman, Administrator and Wayne Dawson, Director of Facilities will be responsible for the correction identified herein. During an interview with Mr. Prutsman, on 02/04/24 he stated that the cover in room 30 had been addressed the day prior and maintenance was working on replacing the cover. 6 Timing of Corrections Room 27 now has new shatter proof LED bulbs. The light fixture in room 28 is covered now however room 28 and room 30 will be rewired and ABHS maintenance staff will replace existing florescent bulbs with shatter proof lights by March 29, 2024. Monitoring & Assurances Mr. Dawson and ABHS Mission’s maintenance and housekeeping staff members are using and documenting the results of a 15- point room inspection audit template, which Mr. Dawson implemented in May 2022 to ensure routine inspections are conducted at least monthly. In addition, ABHS is using the Facilities RTF Maintenance Audit Checklist, and will ensure this audit is done twice per year. Mr. Prutsman will review the results of the room inspections. Mr. Dawson will take appropriate action when needed to ensure compliance with WAC 246-337-120(1). Mr. Dawson will share results with the ABHS Executive Management Team responsible for authorizing facility repairs and improvements. Findings a—c in the Inspection Report are specifically discussed below: a. Broken, cracked light cover in “D hall” room 27. b. Broken, cracked light cover in “D hall” room 28. c. No light cover over tube lighting in “D hall” room 30. RECURRENT DEFICIENCY from last review period 04/25/22. Response: Room 27 now has new shatter proof LED bulbs. The light fixture in room 28 is covered for now however room 28 and room 30 will be rewired and ABHS maintenance staff will replace existing florescent bulbs with shatter proof lights by March 29, 2024. Broken, cracked light covers in rooms 27, 28, and 30 were not cited during the last survey. See May 26, 2022 POC. Older fixtures continue to break so ABHS is moving forward with new, direct wire shatter proof LED lighting in all client rooms. 7 or 4/15/2024 American Behavioral Health System 12715 E Mission Ave Spokane Valley, WA 99216-1027 Re: | Exam Number: X2024-59 License Number: RTF.FS.00001084 Approved Plan of Correction Date(s) of Inspection: 02/06/24.

Introduction We require that you submit a plan of correction for each deficiency listed on the inspection report form. Your plan of correction must be submitted to the DOH within ten business days of receipt of the list of deficiencies. You are required to respond to the Inspection Report with Noted Deficiencies by submitting a plan of correction (POC). Be sure to refer to the deficiency number. If you include exhibits, identify them and refer to them as such in your POC. Descriptive Content Your plan of correction must provide a step-by-step description of the methods to correct each deficient practice to prevent recurrence and provide information that ensures the intent of the regulation is met. An acceptable plan of correction must contain the following elements: e The plan of correcting the specific deficiency; e The procedure for implementing the acceptable plan of correction for the specific deficiency cited; e The monitoring procedure to ensure that the plan of correction is effective and that specific deficiency cited remains corrected and/or in compliance with the regulatory requirements; e The title of the person responsible for implementing the acceptable plan of correction. Simply stating that a deficiency has been \"corrected\" is not acceptable. If a deficiency has already been corrected, the plan of correction must include the following: e How the deficiency was corrected, e The completion date (date the correction was accomplished), e How the plan of correction will prevent possible recurrence of the deficiency. Completion Dates The POC must include a completion date that is realistic and coinciding with the amount of time your facility will need to correct the deficiency. Direct care issues must be corrected immediately and monitored appropriately. Some deficiencies may require a staged plan to accomplish total correction. Deficiencies that require bids, remodeling, replacement of equipment, etc., may need more time to accomplish correction; the target completion date, however, should be within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time-frame. Continued Monitoring Each plan of correction must indicate the appropriate person, either by position or title, who will be responsible for monitoring the correction of the deficiency to prevent recurrence. Checklist: e Before submitting your plan of correction, please use the checklist below to prevent delays. e Have you provided a plan of correction for each deficiency listed? e Does each plan of correction show a completion date of when the deficiency will be corrected? e Is each plan descriptive as to how the correction will be accomplished? e Have you indicated what staff position will monitor the correction of each deficiency? e If you included any attachments, have they been identified with the corresponding deficiency number or identified with the page number to which they are associated? Your plan of correction will be returned to you for proper completion if not filled out according to these guidelines. Note: Failure to submit an acceptable plan of correction may result in enforcement action. Approval of POC Your submitted POC will be reviewed for adequacy by DOH. If your POC does not adequately address the deficiencies in your inspection report you will be sent a letter detailing why your POC was not accepted. Questions? Please review the cited regulation first. If you need clarification, or have questions about deficiencies you must contact the inspector who conducted the onsite inspection, or you may contact the supervisor.
