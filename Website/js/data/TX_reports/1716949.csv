(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan; and 
(2)	more than 12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.
As you know, the heightened monitoring plan for your operation included a specific planned end date at the original 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with the heightened monitoring plan, your operation was unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring by the original planned end date necessitating previous extension.  Furthermore, due to your recent citations issued on January 15, 2025, your operations planned end date must now be revised again, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended again. 
Further details of the administrators failure to ensure compliance include the following: 
Your operation received a medium high weighted citation in a pattern/trend category on January 15, 2025. Specifically, the operation was cited for 748.1101(b)(3)(C) Children's Rights-Adhere to the child's rights to have religious needs met. The operation met compliance on January 23, 2025.

-	Operation failed to demonstrate 6 months of successive compliance with the standard and contract requirements that led to heightened monitoring; and

08/05/2022,748.535(2) - Individual Standards Evaluated,Individual Standards Evaluated,No,08/06/2022,08/05/2022,Individual Standards Evaluated,Medium High,Yes,"During a review conducted on August 5, 2022, it was determined that: 
(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan(s); and 

(2)	more than 12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.

As you know, the heightened monitoring plans for your operation included a specific planned end date at the original 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plans, your operation was unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring by the original planned end date necessitating previous extension.  Furthermore, due to your recent citation issued on May 18, 2022, your operations planned end date must now be revised again, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended again. 

Further details of the failure of your operations administrator to ensure compliance include the following: 
The operation received a medium-high weighted citation in a pattern/trend category on May 18, 2022. Specifically, the operation was cited for 748.2307(8) Other prohibited Punishments. The operation met compliance on June 2, 2022. 
-	Operation failed to demonstrate 6 months of successive compliance with the standard and contract requirements that led to heightened monitoring; and
-	Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations. 

Finding: 748.535(2)  The licensed administrator must ensure the operation complies with current heightened monitoring plans.
