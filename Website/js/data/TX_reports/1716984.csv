","1.Process for Ensuring Complete and Accurate MARs:
Standardized MAR Template: Pinecrest uses a standardized Medication Administration Record (MAR) that includes mandatory fields: medication name, dosage, time of administration, staff initials, staff signature, and running pill count. The form cannot be submitted if fields are left blank.
Staff Training & Competency Testing: All staff responsible for administering medication undergo hands-on MAR training and a competency exam requiring 100% accuracy in recording dosages, signatures, counts, and times. They must demonstrate proper completion of both MAR and Medication Error Reports during testing.
Medication Error Reporting: The Medication Error Log and Reporting Protocol is in place. Every missed, late, or undocumented dose must be reported on the MER form, signed by the staff, and reviewed by the Health Liaison. Reports are filed in the childs record and logged electronically for tracking.
Assurance of Prescribed Administration: Only trained staff are permitted to administer medications. Staff designated to administer medication may not be placed in ratio until training and competency testing are documented. Additionally, medication sheets are cross-checked daily to ensure all medications are dispensed exactly as prescribed.
