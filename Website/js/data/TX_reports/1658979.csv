Furthermore, your operations planned end date must now be revised, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended again. 

Further details of the failure of your operations administrator to ensure compliance include the following: 
- Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations, including having an open investigation(s).
