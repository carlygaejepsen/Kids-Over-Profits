(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan(s); and 
(2)	12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.

As you know, the heightened monitoring plans for your operation included a specific planned end date at the 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plans, your operation is now unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring.  Furthermore, your operations planned end date must now be revised, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended.

Further details of the failure of your operations administrator to ensure compliance include the following: 
-	Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations, including having an open investigation(s). 

Finding: 748.535(2)  The licensed administrator must ensure the operation complies with current heightened monitoring plans.
","A HM extension was approved effective 07/30/2022.  In conjunction with this extension, a new a deadline was established by which all requirements must be completed by your CPA/GRO in order for the operation to be released from its HM plan and move to the Post-plan Monitoring Stage of HM.  Because the extended deadline is now effective, HHSC has determined that the operation is compliant with the requirements of 26 TAC 748.535(2).
