The administrator met with the staff involved multiple times about this incident. There has not been any contact with the child since prior to when the investigation was initiated. They followed up with the staff in the past two weeks and confirmed that there had been no other contact between staff and the child. 

In terms of boundaries, many of our staff maintain contact with kids after they leave. From what I have been able to gather through conversation with them, they are offering encouraging words to the kids and giving them good advice about choices. Our goal is to develop healthy relationships with kids so that the kids can transfer those relationships to other trusted adults in their lives. Given this, I have not specifically told the staff that they cannot have contact with kids after they leave because that would be contrary to what we have always done. However, I have asked that if they plan any in-person visits, I would like to be notified if/when these occur so that I can follow up after the visit and also monitor the frequency. 

I have worked with this staff for more than seven years. In that time, we have not had any incidents that were similar to this one, and they have maintained relationships with other kids that have left the program during that time. I also reviewed their HR file, and there is nothing documented prior to that time regarding any similar type of concerns related to boundaries. ""
