Should a relationship change or develop between two existing employees, or should a relationship be brought to the attention of a supervisor, consultation must take place with the individuals concerned and arrangements put in place so as to comply with this policy. Management should consider any potential interpersonal or operating problems and minimize these by ensuring that the people concerned do not work on the same shift/in the same office when possible and ensuring that other employees in the workplace are confident that they can raise issues where they have concerns that the relationship in question is having
a detrimental effect on the working environment, or on operational issues. Where there are serious concerns about the effect a relationship is having, either on one or both of the employees performance, on others within the team, or especially with our children in care, consultation will take place with the staff involved which may result in one or both of the staff members being redeployed within the organization.

(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan; and 
(2)	12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.
As you know, the heightened monitoring plan for your operation included a specific planned end date at the original 12-month mark by which your operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plan, your operation is now unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring. Furthermore, your operations planned end date must now be revised, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended. 
Further details of the administrators failure to ensure compliance include the following: 
Your operation received a high-weighted citation in a pattern/trend category on 09/01/2023. Specifically, the operation was cited for 748.1101(b)(4)(A) It was found that a staff person treated a child in care unfairly by giving unnecessary discipline and/or excessive consequences to this child. 

 - Operation failed to satisfy the conditions of the plan
- Operation failed to demonstrate 6 months of successive compliance with the standard and contract requirements that led to heightened monitoring; and
- Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations.

Finding: 748.535(2)  The licensed administrator must ensure the operation complies with current heightened monitoring plans.
","An HM extension was approved effective 09/16/2023.  In conjunction with this extension, a new deadline was established by which all requirements must be completed by your GRO in order for the operation to be released from its HM plan and move to the Post-plan Monitoring Stage of HM.
