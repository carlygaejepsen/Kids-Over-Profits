Unity will continue to provide specific training regarding Emergency Behavior Intervention and Behavior Management as it pertains to standard requirements to all the staff.

The staff is aware of appropriate restraint techniques and have been informed when residents invade his boundaries, to use precaution and use restraint as a last alternative.  Mr. Price reported it was not his intent to harm or push this youth but, to prevent this youth from further assault on him and to reduce the need for a restraint.  The expectation is for him to continue to use appropriate judgement when engaging with a combative youth.

The ratio was not mentioned as a concern nor a resident self-harming during this investigation.  However, all staff receives ongoing, mandatory, and appropriate training as it relates to supervision of assigned residents.  This child reportedly self-injured which does not indicate she was not adequately supervised due to the superficial cuts possibly being in a less conspicuous placement on the youth.  The Unity team will continue to provide scenarios to our childcare staff for help to better monitor cases where possibly the childs rights can be violated when completing visible checks. In addition, Treatment Team members will ensure too identify high risk behaviors prior to placement and collectively provide a Safety Plan specific to the childs needs and behaviors.  The Muti-Disciplinary Treatment Team meetings that are scheduled quarterly will continue and discussion of the childs case will be held bi-weekly.  Unity Childrens Home plans to continue providing adequate supervision within the staff to child ratio.  The agency will continue to develop and improve attention to collaborative process."
