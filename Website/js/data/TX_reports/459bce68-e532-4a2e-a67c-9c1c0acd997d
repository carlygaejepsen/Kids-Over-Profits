","Compliance response from the administrator-(Covered in staff notes/meetings March 3-5th) All staff should be on the watch for safety issues and are responsible for putting in a maintenance ticket to have repair completed.  YES +, Program Managers, and Program Administrators should walk their programs daily with a critical eye, looking for both issues with cleanliness and safety hazards regarding doors, windows, flooring or walls and report any and all deficiencies to the facility maintenance department as a Licensing ticket request.  Their findings should be reviewed with their supervisors, and addressed with staff (if cleanliness) or with maintenance if a safety/maintenance issue.  Anything deemed an emergency/licensing should include a phone call to Joseph Rudolph (Sr. Director of Facilities and Food Service), as well as a maintenance ticket being submitted. Maintenance staff will respond to correct deficiencies that are considered minor safety issues within 24 hours.  Items that are considered major safety issues will be corrected within 4 hours by on-call maintenance staff. 

Facilities/maintenance staff conduct preventative maintenance (i.e. changing air filters, change batteries is smoke alarms, etc.) as well as complete items on their maintenance list sent in via the maintenance ticketing system on a regular basis.  Facilities staff should bring to attention any maintenance/safety concerns they observe that have not been submitted for repair, and request staff submit so task can be completed.  Facilities staff should also report to the Program Manager, Administrator or senior leadership, any concerns they have from a cleanliness perspective.

Facility maintenance staff will conduct a monthly walk through of all doors, windows, walls, floors, and ceilings in each live-in facility, to ensure that all areas are safe and in good repair to prevent injuries.  Deficiencies will be documented on the work ticket and repaired immediately.  A Preventive Maintenance recurring work ticket is being created that we can pull from the system to show the walk-throughs.  Beginning on Monday 8th the Sr. Director of Facilities and Food Service, and over the course of the next month (and monthly thereafter), will walk through each program building in Boerne and West Avenue to review all of the areas that need work and schedule work for the following day after the walk through. Photos of the repaired plexiglass was sent via email from the administrator. "

Covered in staff notes/meetings March 3-5th- Although TBRI encourages playful engagement, staff must ensure boundaries.  Playful engagement and horseplaying are two separate things.  We do not allow a lot of horseplay between residents, because it often escalates into physical altercations (residents dont often know when to stop or communicate they are not comfortable with the interaction). This is same for residents and staff.  Staff need to be mindful that playful engagement is used as an appropriate intervention/response to redirect low level behaviors.  Staff should never horseplay with residents."
