In addition, the medication form will also have the names and initials of all staff that are trained to administer medication clearly listed on the form. Specifically, all medication prescribed to the child will have the side effects listed, and the reason the medication was prescribed on each form. The facility will also discontinue the use of medication recording in pencil.

The error report will be reviewed and acknowledged by the administrator and then placed with the medication administration form to be filed at the end of every month. 
 
For children taken medications at school, we will require the nurses to send the childÂ’s medication forms to the facility monthly to ensure the child is taking the medications as prescribed.  The schoolÂ’s medication record will be attached to the facilityÂ’s medication record to cross reference and check for accuracy. Monthly, when medications are given to the school for a child, the nurse will be required to sign our form taking possession of the medications. The number of pills given to the nurse will be listed on the medication administration record and the medication transfer form attached for reference. Furthermore, when kids have medications transferred to the schools or sent home for visits, a legend code of Â“TFÂ” meaning transfer to family, or Â“TSÂ” meaning transfer to school will be written on the medication form with the number of pills transferred.  
 
The administrator and case managers will audit all kidsÂ’ medications weekly to ensure they are administered and accounted for correctly. When a physician makes changes to a childÂ’s medications, the administrator will ensure the changes are implemented and documented accurately on the medication forms. 
 
 All staff have been retrained on this medication procedure as of 4-22-21.
