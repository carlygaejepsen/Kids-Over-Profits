The Child-care Administrator, Doraine Slaughter has been directed by her physicians to maintain work restrictions from a previous injury that requires surgery. She is also in the high-risk category for contracting the coronavirus. Therefore, she worked over 50-60 hours a week combining at-home and in-office time during this covid-19 pandemic. Further she was advised that surgery approval could take up to 3-4 weeks and then recovery requires 2-4 months recuperation time. Therefore, Ms. Slaughter submitted a resignation letter dated 9/26/2020 effective October 10, 2020 (see attached Letter). 

This information was shared with the Investigator, Paul Rovenelli during an investigative telephone interview and prior to the Notification Date. Hemple Shelter has been interviewing candidates to fill the vacancy as soon as possible.
