(1)	your operations administrator failed to ensure compliance with the current HM Plan(s); and 
(2)	12 months had elapsed since the effective date of the plan.

The heightened monitoring plans for this operation included a specific planned end date at the 12-month mark by which the operation was expected to meet all heightened monitoring criteria necessary to move out of active heightened monitoring to a phase of post plan monitoring.  As a direct result of the administrators failure to ensure timely compliance with heightened monitoring plans, this operation is now unable to successfully move to post-plan monitoring.  Furthermore, the operations planned end date must now be revised, and the period of heightened monitoring must be extended.
Further details of the administrators failure to ensure compliance include the following: 

-	Operation failed to demonstrate 6 months of successive compliance with the standard and contract requirements that led to heightened monitoring; and
-	Operation was unable to meet compliance with Medium-High or High weighted licensing citations, including having an open investigation.
