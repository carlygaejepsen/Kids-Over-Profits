Correction: In this instance, houseparent was alleged to have pushed student on multiple occasions. Houseparents in cottage 3 gave notice of their resignation on January 17 and their last day was January 29. This allegation of abuse was not reported to staff until March 4 so we were unable to put in place any disciplinary action with house parent. On March 4 the cottage Case Manager met with a resident from cottage 3 as part of a regular check-in meeting with residents. It was during this meeting at Cottage 3 resident informed him of an incident (date unknow) when house parent shoved student. All our case manages meet with their residents once a week. Case managers are also available to meet with students at times other than their scheduled meetings if a student request a meeting. Case managers meet with their cottage teams every other week. These meetings, with residents and direct care staff, are a time to not only discuss cottage routines, activity planning, schedules, etc., but also a time to bring up and address any issues or concerns. Boys & Girls Country provides on-going support and development to caregivers by providing mandatory weekly*training on TBRI (Trust Based Relational Intervention) principles and strategies for managing behaviors and Trauma Informed Care. Training topics also include managing stress and self-care. *Training are held weekly during the school year but we cannot commit to a weekly training schedule during summer months when the residents are home."
