""Hi Eduardo,

I did speak with Mr. Lujan about this.  We will be certain to have an Out of Office message with a back-up contact anytime we are unable to check emails daily during the work week.  We will also go back over the weeks emails each Friday to be sure none were missed or overlooked throughout the week. 

Additionally we could create an email just for these requests that would include a group of people authorized to respond.  That way those in the group could respond if either myself or Mr. Janawicz are unavailable in a timely manner.  Please let us know if that would be helpful and we can create that address and share it with your office.""
