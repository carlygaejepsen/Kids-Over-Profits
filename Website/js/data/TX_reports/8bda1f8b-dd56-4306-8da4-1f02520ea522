The staff member involved in the incident was provided with an Emergency Behavior Intervention (EBI) re-training by the facility Risk Manager on 4/23/21. The re-training focused on alternative interventions to consider before use of restraint, in response to property damage. The staff member was receptive to the re-training and has since used the information to enhance his job skills. All other caregivers that work with the patient involved in the incident also received the same information, provided by the facility Risk Manager, in a team meeting held on 4/15/21.

All applications of EBI, including restraints and emergency medications, will continue to be monitored on a daily basis, by use of video camera and documentation review. The facility will continue to reinforce all safe and justified applications of EBI, in addition to providing feedback, re-training, and formal supervision (including possible termination) for employees engaging in EBI without proper justification or use of improper technique.

The facility Childcare Administrator and Performance Improvement Director will also continue to monitor EBI data on a daily basis to help identify any trends and patterns needed for further improvement.
