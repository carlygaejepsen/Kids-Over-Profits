During this inspection, 3 out of Direct Care Staff and 1 out of 1 youth file were reviewed. 1 out of Direct Care Staff and 1 out of 1 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, December 20, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement will be emailed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments and Daily Residential Care form, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPM King and LPA Mac observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Administrator Khea Gumbs.",

LPA inspected the posted LIC 500 and found S1 not listed . Dwayne White, Acting Administrator stated that S1's last day of employment was March 21, 2024 . Dwayne White, Acting Administrator stated the reason S1 has not been disassociated from the Guardian rosters is because of a change in Human Resource Directors. HR1 is no longer the Human Resource Director, who was able to make changes in Guardian. The new HR Director HR2 is the only authorized to make changes, and may not know how. Dwayne White, Acting Administrator stated that the Licensee was unable to remove S1 from the Guardian Rosters, yesterday. LPA advises that S1 be disassociated from all REFUGE facilities on Guardian rosters immediately.

LPA met with Administrator Brittany Flentroy and Facility Manager Sara Haile and informed of the purpose of the visit. During an investigation at the facility, LPA observed that the facility submitted an incident report for a restraint that took place on 4/11/24. The report indicated staff \"contained\" a resident, and through this investigation, LPA learned that this \"containment\" was a restraint. The reporting requirements for restraints were not followed, due to the report not indicating the type of restraint used nor the length of the restraint. Further, the facility's plan of operation indicates that no restraints will be performed at any time. Additionally, LPA observed that staff statements reflect that the facility has blanket policies to conduct searches of residents at intake and to confiscate cell phones. LPA observed that the facility's plan of operation indicates that residents will be allowed to access their cellphones and that no specific search policies at intake are outlined in the plan of operation. LPA is issuing a citation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Reporting Requirements, Subsection (i)(7)(C) and ILS Section Plan of Operation, Subsection (f). LPA also verbally advised of ILS Personal Rights to provide technical support and ensure familiarity with relevant regulations for the plan of operation updates.

III facility for the purpose of conducting a case management inspection regarding an Incident Report Follow-Up dated 07/29/2025 involving Client 1 (C1) and Client 2 (C2). (see LIC Confidential Names List dated 08/07/25). LPA Sawyer and LPA Pavia met with Program Supervisor, Dwayne White (S3). There are two clients in care currently present. LPA Sawyer requested Staff Roster and Staff Schedule to cross reference staffing on the day of initial Incident Report. Based on a review of the incident report received by the department, the facility did not provide information on a plan moving forward for the clients. Clarification was needed regarding how this incident occurred as the description did not provide all pertinent information, as well as the plan for both clients moving forward, how will staff ensure that clients feel safe and prevent an event like from occurring again, and what was done with the pepper spray. During the conversation with Mr. White, follow up information was given regarding the aforementioned issues. Pepper spray was confiscated and meeting was held with youth in care. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was given to Program Supervisor Dwayne White, whose signature confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst LPA (LPA) Alyssa Burgess called Director Annette Jumper to deliver the closure of this case management inspection that was opened on 8/13/2020. LPA met with Director over FaceTime, a video conferencing application. On 7/30/ CCL received an incident report dated 7/26/2020 which described client C1 (see confidential names list dated 8/13/2020 - LIC811) going into other clients' rooms and trying to remove their belongings. Staff attempted to redirect C1 but he picked up some fruit, slamming it on the counter, and ripping bags of fruit open. C1 took some fruit to his room. Staff followed C1 and observed him. Client stated he can do whatever he wanted and called staff names. Staff asked C1 to keep it down and C1 stopped in front of the staff postured like he was going to hit staff in the face with the fruit. Staff claimed he did not have time to safely evade, so staff took hold of C1 in a restraint. Staff had another staff open the door and then assisted staff in restraining C1 outside. C1 was thrashing around and threatening violence via gang. Staff called Law Enforcement (LE) based on C1's threats. When LE arrived, staff released C1 and C1 talked with LE. They agreed for C1 to stay in his room for the rest of the night. No further incident. LPA investigated this restraint's validity and the escalation of the incident. LPA interviewed six clients and four staff on 7/31/2020, 8/13/2020, 11/3/2020, and 11/4/2020. The client involved stated that the staff spoke to him inappropriately, slapped the bananas out of his hand, pushed up against him, and put him in a headlock after he came back from an unauthorized absence late at night. According to interviews provided, only one other client observed this incident. During interviews with the other clients, the one client who observed stated the staff restrained the client when he ran at staff, called him a name, and pushed staff to get out. This client stated the staff didn't really know how to take hold properly, but didn't feel the staff did anything wrong. One client stated that he heard staff talking to the client before he fell asleep and stated the staff had an aggressive tone, but he didn't know what happened. This client also stated that he has no knowledge of this staff restraining clients inappropriately. Another client stated the staff's attitude is usually calm, not aggressive, not threatening, kind, and normal. This client also stated the staff had never done an inappropriate restraint before. During interviews with other staff LPA learned that the staff appeared to have jumped into the restraint too soon. During LPA's interviews with the involved staff and other staff, LPA asked about the staff's use of de-escalation techniques, which were found to be lacking. The involved staff explained that his methods for de-escalation was reminding the client of the rules. Staff explained that he did this multiple times. The staff stated the client came to the facility under the influence and was acting out of character earlier in the day, in an off-put mood and cursing out staff. LPA discussed with staff how his de-escalation techniques of repeating rules to the agitated client may have further escalated him. The staff understood and agreed. When the restraint/escort initially occurred the staff stated that when the client swung the bananas up to posture to hit him with them, he immediately took hold for his safety. LPA asked the staff about his consideration of evasion. Staff explained that he did not think of evading. Staff explained that he did have a conversation about this with the Manager that reviews incident reports. The statements that the client made against staff that he used inappropriate language, pushed him, and put him in a headlock were unsubstantiated based on other client and staff interviews. The staff involved denied that he did those things. While the restraint may have been unavoidable in the end, the use of proper de-escalation techniques and evasion or backing down may have also prevented the restraint. On this date, LPA is issuing an advisory note, which is not a citation, for the lack of de-escalation techniques, and lack of evading to prevent the restraint. At 9: AM an exit interview was conducted with Director, and a copy of this report was emailed to her with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

    "narrative": "The minor had no previous incidences of self-harm since placement at the facility; the youth having ingested a detergent pod was new and unusual behavior-LPA found no reported occurrences of the client even attempting to do self-harm or expressing suicidal ideations. As such, there was no reasonable cause to restrict the client's access to cleaning supplies during chore time during which youths are encouraged and expected to complete assigned chores as part of the facility's daily program. Per the clients interviewed, the cabinet in which the cleaning chemicals are stored is otherwise always locked; this LPA, during an unannounced inspection, also found the storage of these chemicals to be secured. The minor, upon exhibiting GI symptoms, was taken to acute care to be treated for ingestion of a toxic substance. The case-carrying County Social Work Supervisor confirmed that this was uncharacteristic of the youth, that the client had no prior instances of self-harm at the facility, and expressed confidence in the facility's ability to provide care and supervision to the minor in question. Though the youth did gain access to a potentially hazardous cleaning agent, this was not due to neglect, a lack of supervision, or incompliance with the youth's care plan on the part of facility staff. Based on LPA's interviews and a records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation is found to be UNSUBSTANTIATED-although the allegation may have been valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove a violation did or did not occur.

Though there was some sort of physical contact between the staff-person and the youth, the force with which the youth hit the ground cannot be determined, nor can it be ascertained if \"slam\" was an appropriate description of how the staffer and the youth fell to the floor. The youth did not sustain any injuries from the incident and did not report feeling unsafe with, or around, the staff member in question.

    "narrative": "During an incident that took place on 04/26/2025 in which a facility staffer was attempting to verbally de-escalate a client, a certain term was used by that staff member and directed it to the client. Although the exact word was in dispute, there was enough corroboration from three confidential interviews, including that staff-person's own admission, that it was disparaging and inconsistent with trauma-informed language. The staff member was formally counseled by their supervisor on 05/23/2025 (prior to the investigation being opened). Based on interviews and a records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met; therefore, the allegation is found to be Substantiated. Interim Licensing Standards 87072(c)(1) is being cited on the attached LIC 9099-D. Exit interview conducted; a copy of this report is being provided, along with the Appeal Rights, to the facility. Though there was some corroboration between two client statements about a possible improper hold or restraint applied to a client, details were inconsistent as to how and when this was purported to happen. Staff consistently were able to describe the proper tenets of emergency intervention techniques and justifications for use, including the application of manual restraints, and that no physical holds that resemble a \"choke hold\" should ever be utilized. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur; therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "On May 25, 2021, and office conference was held with San Diego Center for Children (SDCC) Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) via Microsoft Teams, due to COVID-19 pandemic. In attendance were: Community Care Licensing representatives Regional Manager (RM) LaCresha Cook, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Ann Valenzuela, LPM Stephanie Hudak, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Marisol Lopez; SDCC representatives- Director Ervey Salinas LMFT, Assistant Director of Operations/Residential Meghan Dambacher, Clinical Manager Yasmin Williams, LMFT, Clark Clinical Program Manager Marissa Jones, Training Specialist Michelle Pechtl, Nurse Manager Jennifer Loya, QA Director Misty Howard; CDSS/Systems of Care Provider Development Manager Marjana Jackson. San Diego County Representatives included: Senior Probation Officer Jorge Aguilar, Institutions Evaluation Unit (IEU) Monitor Julie Martinez, IEU Manager Natasha Hood, IEU/Contracts Supervisor Lyn Worthington, and Contracting Officer Representative Gentiana Janina. The following issues were discussed: \uf0b7 Complaints \uf0b7 Emergency Intervention Plan \uf0b7 Training During the meeting, LPM Hudak addressed that this meeting is to support and discuss how CCL can assist the facility in avoiding health and safety issues associated with the use of restraints. LPM Hudak discussed the substantiated complaints due to inappropriate restraint holds within the last 2 years and requested information on what the facility has changed to decrease holds; how the facility is incorporating the emergency intervention plan and how staff is being trained. (see continuation form LIC809-C dated 05/25/21) In response, the facility representative discussed the quality council and data collection that the facility has in place. The facility reviews and disperses the information to train staff and changes actions to meet the needs of clients. The Quality control group for the facility looks at data monthly in an extensive and very detailed data that is compared going back two years. In report details, the facility looks at the durations of holds, times of holds, clients with increased holds, staff who are conducting the holds and any patterns. The facility also reviews injuries and what can be modified to prevent injuries caused during activities. The facility uses trends as support in CFT's to show volume, to see effects of medications and to update weekly meetings on any new trends that have been observed. The facility never looks at numbers by themselves and looks at the number of incidents per occupied bed. Also in response, it was stated the review of the data supports the facility when adding extra services; assessing levels of need; to discuss other services to meet the clients needs; providing incentive plans; changing the way things are done which can include providing a client more breaks, providing psychological testing for functional level, getting a local CASA representative to visit children; reviewing campus video footage for staff feedback on interventions or to review incidents and finding better placement for the staff if the staff is better with adolescents vs. young children. It was specified that multiple staff read incident reports and give staff ideas on what could have been improved or provide feedback for trainings. LPM Hudak asked if the facility is still utilizing SPA as part of their emergency intervention plan and the facility responded they have used SPA since 2007 and haven't found a need to change the program. The facility receives current and up to date trainings yearly from the Devereux Foundation. RM Cook inquired about what the facility is doing to support staff's wellbeing and self-care. The facility discussed the importance of staff self-care and the Wellness Programs offered to encourage staff to take 5 minutes of meditations, take time off or use mental health days, increase team building activities, and provide time for staff to talk about stress levels. The facility highlighted the importance of staff wellness and the encouragement for self-care. All recommendations/suggestions and requirements given during the meeting by CCL were acknowledged by STRTP representatives. County and CCR representatives had no recommendations to add. (see continuation form LIC809-C dated 05/25/21) In closing, all parties were satisfied with all information that was discussed during the meeting. CCL is requesting the following be submitted by 6/25/21: A copy of the Internal Biannual Review of the emergency interventions that was completed by SDCC for January 2021. Also, for future comparison, CCL is also requesting that SDCC submit the Biannual Review due by July 5, 2021. CCL will review both reports to see the trends, patterns, and data collected by the facility and what modifications were recommended by the administrative staff of SDCC. LPA met with SDCC Director Ervey Salinas via tele-inspection to answer any questions. A copy of this report was emailed to SDCC Director Ervey Salinas with \"read receipt\" notification to verify that the licensee received the report.

Confidential interviews denied lack of supervision however clients (C1, C2) were not available for interview.

On March 24, 2022, Community Care Licensing received information alleging that Staff #1 (see LIC811 dated 03/14/2023) pushed minor #2 (see LIC811 dated 03/14/2023) while in care. Confidential interviews with two staff revealed that the minor was pushed by the staff while multiple witnesses were present. Documentation was received of three written witness statements. Confidential interviews confirm that the staff member #S1 did push the minor in care. The minor was unable to be interviewed at this time although multiple attempts were made. LPA received consistent confidential information and documentation that the allegation occurred. Based on interviews and information gathered during the investigation, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined the allegation that the staff #1 pushed the minor #2 while in care is substantiated. This posed an immediate health and safety risk to the children placed in care. These actions are in violation of the Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Chapter 7.5, Version 4, Article 6, 87072(c) Personal Rights. See attached LIC 9099D for cited deficiency.

LPA Mendoza met with Administrator, Scheron Douglas, due to the current Administrator LaTasha Knighten being out on leave. The facility has not been operating since May of 2021 so the facility has been vacant. Therefore, LPA Mendoza did not use Inspection Tool during todays inspection. Please note, the facility has been in communication with CCL regards to their current status. LPA Mendoza toured the facility inside and out and found the facility to be safe, clean and in good repair. During LPA Mendoza's walk thru LPA observed the facility having all items packed in plastic bins. The refrigerator and freezer were empty, and were unplugged due to the facility closure. LPA toured the upstairs and there were a total of 5 bedrooms. All bed rooms were empty and three were storing plastic bins, mattresses, and bed frames. The Administrator confirmed that their maintenance person visits the facility every 2 months to ensure the facility remains in good standing. Per Administrator Scheron, the facility believes they will not be operating until sometime next year (2022). The facility is still in discussion if they will remain as an STRTP or may change to another facility type. At this time the facility wants to remain as an STRTP due to the agency still deciding. Once the facility make a decision they will notify LPA Mendoza immediately. LPA Mendoza also advised the facility to check in with LPA by January of 2022, so LPA can know what the facility current status is. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report was left with the Administrator.",

LPA met with Program Manager Dessoni Redmond at the facility and informed of the purpose of the visit. LPA also discussed the purpose of the visit with Administrator Teyona Galloway over the phone. Administrator confirmed that the facility is currently non-operational as a short-term residential therapeautic program (STRTP) and is instead being utilized as office and conference space for the operations of the licensee's other STRTP in the area. Therapists' offices are housed at the site, and staff meetings and therapeutic activies for the residents are hosted at the site. As such, there are no residents in care nor staff employed at this facility site. The licensee has been advised that they would be permitted to forfeit the license and still utilize this building as currently used. LPA toured the facility site and observed no safety hazards. Hot water measured within permitted range, and the site was maintained at a comfortable temperature within permitted range. Bathrooms and kitchen are maintained in clean and sanitary condition. Since the site is not in operation as a care facility at this time, there are no residents in care nor care staff working, so no interviews were conducted and no files were reviewed. No deficiency citations are being issued. LPA observed a few areas where technical support may be beneficial. See LIC Advisory Notes attached.

LPA requested that the necessary revisions be made and submitted to LPA and that the administrator respond to LPA by 8/16/24 with an anticipated submission date. Additionally, LPA requested the following specific items be addressed in the revised plan of operation (POO) / program statement (PS). 1) Staff Ratios The current PS indicates the staff to child ratio is 1 staff to 4 children. LPA advised that ILS Section 87065.5 requires that facilities with a capacity of 7 or more follow specific ratios for on-site supervision. LPA read through the section and explained that this means the following ratios must be followed for this facility, as it has a licensed capacity of 8: From 7AM-10PM: When 1 child is present, there shall be 1 awake direct care staff; when 2 to 4 children are present, there shall be 2 awake staff; when 4 to 8 children are present, there shall be 2 awake staff. From 10PM-7AM: When 1 child is present, there shall be 1 awake direct care staff; when 2 to 6 children are present, there shall be 2 awake staff; when 7 to 8 children are present, there shall be 2 awake staff. See Page 2 2) Search Policies During an investigation at the facility, it was learned that the facility is conducting person searches of children. LPA advised that specific search policies be outlined in the revised PS for the licensing agency's review. LPA also advised that blanket policies will not be allowed, but policies for case-specific searches authorized by the authorized representative may be reviewed by the licensing agency. 3) Cell Phone Policies The current PS includes a cell phone contract that permits the facility to confiscate children's cell phones. LPA advised that ILS Section 87072 requires that children be accorded the right to possess their personal belongings, which would include their cell phones, unless prohibited by a discipline program. LPA requested that the revised PS remove the blanket policy to confiscate cell phones.

In confidential interviews, all clients that were interviewed provided consistent statements that the bathroom is dirty with grime and mildew present in the shower. The house manager (HM) provided a statement that the bathroom is cleaned up by clients followed by staff checking that bathroom/shower is clean.

The focused staff (FS) who was identified in the report denied the allegation. Other staff workers that were interviewed denied the allegation and corroborated the FS statement. Information gathered from staff interviews and some of the clients suggest that the focused client (FC) who reported the allegation suggests or appears the client has a physical attraction towards a female staff worker (FS). In confidential interviews, four clients provided consistent statements and denied the allegations. The four clients disclosed that they were aware of the allegation being reported by another client because the FC was overheard speaking about his actions after the report was filed. The one-focused client (FC) stated that he believes a staff spoke inappropriately toward him. The FC did not respond when asked if he is physically attracted to a female staff. The FC admitted speaking to the FS saying inappropriate sexual comments and was told that he is making the staff feel uncomfortable. Information provided by staff and other clients disclosed that the focused client has admitted that he \"likes the FS\". The Facility Administrator has placed a second member of staff to work with the FS during her regular night shift as a form of support. The Administrator continues to monitor the situation involving that one client and his actions involving a member of staff who works nights. Based on the available information obtained by staff and clients, the above allegation is determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is no preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the facility staff representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection. An exit interview was conducted, and the Appeal rights were given and explained. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

    "narrative": "On 09/13/2024, the Department received a complaint alleging that a staff worker (S1) applied a chokehold to a client (client to be identified only as C1 for this report), including making inappropriate comments about his overall status being placed in a facility, and that his family doesn't love him. S1 denied the allegations that he applied a chokehold to a client. S1 denied telling a client his family does not love him, which is why he is in a facility. S1 disclosed that on 09/01/24., a client got upset for impatiently waiting to be served more food, aside from just finished eating a large meal. S1 reported that C1 got upset, grabbed S1's food, and threw it at him, including smearing fries on his face. S1 reported that C1 became combative and was attempting to hit him. S1 only held his wrists or hands to prevent being injured by the client. S1 reported that other staff workers assisted and escorted the client to his bedroom without further incident. In confidential interviews, two staff workers who witnessed the incident denied the allegations, other staff workers provided statements to support S1 saying that he is not the type of person who would do and say things inappropriately to a client. In confidential interviews with five clients, they revealed inconsistent statements and could not corroborate the reported allegations against the staff identified in the report. Based on the information gathered during confidential interviews, and records reviewed, it cannot be determined whether the allegations occurred resulting in staff applying a chokehold to a client, and staff making inappropriate comments to a client. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the agency representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection. An exit interview was conducted and the Appeal rights were given and explained. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

In addition, it was reported that C1 didn't make contact with either C2 or C3 with the rock, but law enforcement called in a violation of assault with a deadly weapon. During investigation, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that C1 and C2 were involved in a verbal altercation that escalated to a physical altercation outside, although staff attempted to prevent C1 from going outside. However, C1 was able to get outside by escaping the house through the back door. In addition, multiple confidential interviews corroborated that staff attempted to de-escalate the altercation, however, C1 exited the area and pursued C2 and C3 with a rock. During the pursuit, C2 tripped and sustained a knee injury. LPAs received conflicting information. Based on interviews, the allegation that staff did not prevent bullying among children resulting in an altercation may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations, therefore, this allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was provided to Regional Director, Dana Centanni.",

Clients reported using marijuana when they leave the facility on an unauthorized basis and do come back under the influence; however, they report that staff not only discourage that behavior they are asked to empty their possessions to search for contraband. An interview was conducted with C1 on 04/20/2021 at around 3:30pm. The interview further confirmed the statements clients made on 01/08/2021. Client confirmed that upon learning of the allegations staff separated client from C2 and shared a room with a different roommate. The C1 reported that C2 did not share a room with anyone else. The client stated that they pretended to sleep when staff were checking on them only to get up for the 15 minutes between when staff would come and check on them. C1 stated they were quiet when the incident happened and they were using a vape pen; which they hid after using. C1 reported this incident took place in the span of 3 -4 minutes. Interview with C2 on 01/08/2021 did not result with any information, the client denied participating or knowing anything about the allegations. Note that C2 was accused of being the perpetrator of the inappropriate contact and one of the instigators of using marijuana at the facility. An interview was also conducted with direct care staff Karolina Redondo on 05/13/2021 at approximately 3:30pm. The interview confirmed the staff check on clients every 15 minutes over night. Karolina indicated she was supervising clients when one of the incidents of inappropriate conduct occurred. Karolina stated that she had supervised the clients the whole time while at a car wash. She had taken clients to assist with washing the facility van as and activity and chore. Karolina was also cleaning the van with clients. She stated that nothing was reported to her or observed during the activity. It was alleged C2 had used the vacuum at the car wash to place near the C3's buttocks. Karolina stated that yes, clients used the vacuum but did not observe or hear the clients using the vacuum in an inappropriate manner. Although the allegations may have occurred or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence that they occurred as a result of lack of supervision by staff; therefore, the allegations above are unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the administrator Victoria Shannon. No deficiencies were cited. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was emailed for a signature to Victoria Shannon.",

The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, monthly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

The purpose of this case management is to discuss information received during a review of an incident that occurred at the facility. The incident involved Child #1 (C1). See Confidential Names List form (LIC 811) dated 05/03/2022. On 04/15/2022, LPA Valenzuela conducted a review of facility records and conducted interviews. Interviews conducted revealed that on 03/05/2022, Child #1, ingested a non-prescribed medication. Interviews revealed it is unknown how C1 obtained the non prescribed medication. Per interviews and records review, on 03/05/2022, at 6:20pm, C1 had \"convulsion like actions\" and \"was unable to speak to staff\". Interviews and records revealed Staff #1 (S1) called the facility Administrator at 6:22 pm to speak with administrator regarding C1's condition. Per records review, at 6:24 pm, facility staff called 911 for C1's medical emergency. Interviews and records review indicate staff have not received training on medical emergency response procedures or topics related to the effects of medications on children. Based on interviews and records, the Department has determined there is a preponderance of evidence the facility did not ensure that direct care staff have appropriate skills to protect the health and safety of Child #1.

    "narrative": "that some facility staff are aware that specific clients may be using and bringing vape pens into the facility when the contraband is found. Per confidential interviews, staff will make an effort to prevent clients from using vape pens and bringing vape pens into the facility by having regular small group meetings with the clients to address these issues. Confidential interviews reported that if staff were concerned about a specific client and their use of vape pens and bringing vape pens to the facility, then the in-house therapist would be advised to address these issues in therapy. Confidential interviews reported that if a client has shown a history of bringing in contraband or is suspected of bringing in contraband, then facility staff will conduct a search of their room. Confidential interviews reported that vape pens had been found during room searches. Per facility policy, when clients return from leaving without permission and they were recently caught with vape pens or have a history of bringing back vape pens, the staff will search their items such as shoes, dresser drawers, closets, bags, and ask the clients to empty their pockets. In addition, confidential interviews stated that staff would knock on bathroom doors if clients were taking too long in the bathrooms from what the client stated the purpose for them to be in the bathrooms. Confidential interviews also reported that these concerns were addressed in clients' updated needs and service plans. Other confidential interviews reported that when facility staff encounters a client using a vape pen, they address the behavior immediately and confiscate the contraband. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegation that staff do not prevent minors in care from using nicotine vapes in the facility is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report and appeal rights were explained and given to Administrator Francine Haynes.",

The Department was informed facility clients were walking around the community at all hours of the day, including the evening, up to three times during one week. Staff denied the allegation. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with staff revealed the facility uses an incentive-based program which affords clients the opportunity to leave the facility and return by a set curfew. Staff interviewed reported clients also leave the facility without authorization. In situations where clients leave without authorization, staff reported they follow protocol. Staff attempt to verbally redirect clients, try to obtain the location of where clients are going and shadow clients as they leave the facility until visual is lost. Upon clients return, staff reported they inquire if clients need medical attention, ask what occurred while they were away from the facility and offer clients a meal. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted indicated staff supervise clients diligently. Clients interviewed consistently reported staff follow protocol during unauthorized absences. Statements obtained from CSWs did not reveal concerns related to the reported allegation. One CSW reported her client was prone to leaving the facility without authorization. In an effort to deter the client from leaving the facility without authorization, staff reportedly reach out the clients relatives to schedule visits. The facility offered relatives traveling accommodations to be able to attend the visits. Based on information obtained through interviews conducted and records reviewed the allegation was Unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the standard of the preponderance of evidence was not met. Exit interview conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the facility representative. No deficiencies were cited.",

Staff denied the allegation that minors are allowed to have access to contraband while in care. The allegation was regarding an incident involving two residents fighting over contraband at the facility on 2/16/23 where law enforcement was contacted to stop the fight. It was alleged law enforcement did not confiscate the contraband and staff allowed the residents to have the contraband. Record review revealed law enforcement was contacted by a resident after the altercation to report assault. In addition, statements obtained confidential interviews conducted indicated that the fight was a result of a resident accusing another resident of stealing her marijuana earlier that day. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted and interviews with staff indicated that no contraband was observed or located during the incident. Staff denied the allegation that a staff is having an inappropriate relationship with a client in care. However, statements obtained from interviews conducted with staff revealed clients reported observing inappropriate interactions between a staff and client. When interviewed by the Department and another agency, all clients denied the allegation. Staff denied the allegation that they hit minors at the facility. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted revealed there are no witnesses who observed staff physically abuse clients. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with staff revealed staff may use a loud, stern, or raised tone of voice but, it is dependent on the behavior of the clients. Staff stated they use this tone of voice when clients are having a behavior such as arguing, fighting, or bullying another client. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted indicated staff yell at residents for insignificant incidents such as not cleaning their rooms, washing dishes, or being loud. Other clients reported staff yell when staff feel clients are provoking them or disrespectful, when clients are misbehaving, when clients are running and screaming inside the facility and when clients do not listen, act aggressively, or damage property. (Continued on page 3) Page Staff denied they are not preventing innapropriate sexual interactions between minors in the facility. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with staff revealed they became aware two clients were dating. Staff immediately adjusted the sleeping arrangements and actively supervised the clients if they were together in common areas. In addition, the facility did not allow the clients to visit each other's room. Staff statements were corroborated by statements obtained while conducting confidential interviews. Staff denied clients leave the facility on an unauthorized absence due to inadequate supervision. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with staff indicate staff verbally redirect clients when they suspect a client will leave the facility without an approved pass. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted corroborated staff statements. During the course of the investigation LPA Larios attempted to interview six placing agency social workers however, only two were interviewed. Statements obtained from interviews conducted with social workers indicated there were no concerns regarding the referral. Based on information gathered from interviews conducted and record review the allegations are unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, the standard of the preponderance of evidence was not met. A copy of this report and Confidential Names form LIC811 dated 6/15/23 were given to the above mentioned facility representative. Exit interview conducted. No deficiencies were cited.",

It indicated that Ref. #1 rushed staff and began swinging their arms wildly at staff. It indicated that Ref. #1 was placed in a MAB containment for three minutes until calm. The CSW stated that Ref. #1 did not inform them of this incident, and at the time they had weekly Child and Family Team Meetings. The CSW stated that Ref. #1 tantrums when Ref. #1 does not get their way. There were no other witnesses to the incident. The LPA is unable to corroborate the allegations.

The information was present in Ref. #3's personnel record and in the Licensing System. Guardian indicated that on May 23, 2022, Ref. #3 required a Criminal Record Exemption. Correspondence was generated and mailed to three addresses for Scott's Youth Facility, Rancho Sierra St, Bakersfield, 93306, H St., #25, Bakersfield 93301 and Glenwood Drive, Bakersfield, 93306. The correspondence indicated that Ref. #3 could not work or be present in an agency licensed by the Department. As mentioned above, the HR Manager indicated that the H St address is incorrect.

    "investigation_findings": "13On July 3, 2024, at 11: AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Winston Moroney conducted a complaint inspection at the above Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) and met with the Facility Unit Coordinator Jackie Aguilar. The inspection aimed to deliver the finding(s) regarding the complaint allegation(s). On January 18, 2024, the Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services received a complaint from the Centralized Complaint and Information Bureau (CCIB) with the following allegation(s): The staff did not prevent inappropriate interaction between youth. This LPA conducted the investigation of the above allegation(s) and it consisted of but was not limited to a review of records, including the client's needs and services plans, medical records, and interviews with three staff members (S1, S2) on 1/30/24, S3 on 2/5/24, and 2 of 3 clients (C2, and C3) on 1/25/24. C1 declined to be interviewed, so no statement was obtained from them. (Reference Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated July 3, 2024). The Following Allegation(s) were reported: 1. The staff did not prevent inappropriate interaction between youth. The team (S1, S2, and S3) have denied the accusation and highlighted their proficiency in trauma-informed care. They implement all necessary steps to guarantee a secure and healthy environment for all individuals. The team recognizes that each individual is unique and may need different approaches to de-escalate specific situations. In the incident that was reported, it began earlier in the day when C2 and C3 unexpectedly took a photo of C1, which greatly upset C1. Later, on their way back from an outing, C2 and C3 started teasing C1 about the photo taken earlier in the day. S1 stepped in by trying to redirect C2 and C3 verbally and changing the subject of conversation. Upon returning to the facility, C2 and C3 got out of the vehicle, but C1 refused to do so. After a few minutes of attempting to verbally redirect C1, S1 allowed C2 and C3 to enter the facility. However, shortly after, C2 and C3 came back out with a small mop and a hand duster, pretending to clean the vehicle and making noises to provoke C1. The team verbally redirected C2 and C3 back into the facility. Soon after, C1 got out of the vehicle and entered the facility with the team. C1 informed the team that she had called the police while in the car and falsely claimed to have been physically assaulted by C2 and C3. Later that evening, the police arrived at the facility, spoke to all the individuals involved, reviewed the driveway camera footage, and determined that no crime had taken place. The team stresses that, aside from occasional disagreements, the individuals have not had any issues with each other. Information provided by C2 and C3 further supported the above, indicating that they feel safe and satisfied living at the facility. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Foster Family Agency. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Unit Coordinator. UnsubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

Information obtained during the course of the investigation corroborated the allegations. On 8/19/24 around 1: AM, a client was able to obtain the key to a facility vehicle and drove herself, and two other clients away from the facility. Law enforcement was contacted and the vehicle was located. The client refused to yield to law enforcement and a pursuit ensued. Ultimately, the pursuit concluded when the client drove past a red light, through an intersection and struck another vehicle. Responding deputies observed a client \"pinned\" inside the front passenger side of the vehicle, unresponsive and unconscious. Medical records obtained during the course of the investigation revealed the passenger sustained trauma to the head resulting in brain bleeding. Statements obtained from confidential interviews conducted revealed the client was able to enter the staff office through an unlocked door and obtain the key from a safe which was also unlocked. Although staff who were interviewed stated it is procedure to ensure the staff office and safe are secure, staff could not confirm that the procedure was followed on the date of the incident. The facility is cited for violation of California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. The facility staff failed to ensure the vehicle key was secure and inaccessible to clients, resulting a client stealing a facility vehicle and client sustaining injuries during the ensuing car ride. Per the new Civil Penalty laws, Health and Safety (H&S) Code section 1548(E), an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) determination is pending due to the substantiated allegation. If an ECP is warranted, a Community Care Licensing (CCL) representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment.

Although the alleged victim maintained she was punched on the face by S1, other clients did not report witnessing S1 hit C1 or reported they were aware of the allegation through hearsay. Record review revealed KCSD deputies arrived at the facility on the evening of 6/5/24 in response to an alleged battery incident and observed C1 with minor injuries to her nose and cheek. The KCSD report states no other clients or staff members witnessed the alleged incident. Based on information gathered from interviewed conducted and record review, the allegation is unsubstantiated.

During the inspection LPA Larios met with Administrator, Trina Smith. The purpose of the inspection was to assess an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) due to a client sustaining seriously bodily injury while in the care of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP). On August 20, 2024, the Department received a complaint alleging a client residing at this STRTP sustained severe injuries due to staff neglect and, in addition, STRTP staff did not ensure clients did not have access to facility vehicle keys. The allegations were substantiated; the investigation concluded STRTP staff did not ensure the staff office was inaccessible to clients and did not secure a safe containing the facility vehicle key. On 8/19/24, at 1: AM, a client accessed the staff office through an unlocked door, obtained the facility vehicle key, stole the facility vehicle and was involved in a vehicle collision while driving. A passenger client suffered traumatic brain injury with multiple punctate hemorrhages, predominantly involving the anterior frontal and temporal lobes during the collision. The Department has concluded an analysis and determined that an ECP is warranted. Under Health and Safety Code section 1548 (f)(1)(C) a violation that the Department determines results in serious bodily injury as defined in Section 243 of the Penal Code, to a person receiving care at a short term residential therapeutic program, there shall be a civil penalty of $2,500.00. Under Section 243 of the Penal Code, \"Serious bodily injury\" means a serious impairment of physical condition, including, but not limited to, the following: loss of consciousness; concussion; bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ; a wound requiring extensive suturing; and serious disfigurement. Exit interview conducted.

STRTP staff interviews revealed that they denied hitting or pushing the youth with a fan and stated they had no recollection of the allegation.STRTP staff explained that they have never used an object to move or physically harm a youth in their care. Four youths were interviewed as part of the investigation. Interviews with two foster youths revealed that neither witnessed the alleged incident involving S1 and a fan. One youth heard about a disagreement involving S1 but did not know the details while the other was asleep. Three out of four youths reported feeling safe in the facility and denied witnessing or experiencing physical harm from staff.One youth stated that she tried to retrieve a fan being used to cool off, and while holding the fan with S1, the back of the fan hit her stomach. Based on the statements provided by staff and other youth in the home, there is insufficient evidence to confirm that a staff member used a fan to push or hit minor in care. One staff member stated, \"I do not recall the specific incident and have never used an object to harm a youth.\" The interviewed youth reported hearing about a disagreement but did not witness any physical altercation. Therefore, the allegation that a staff member used a fan to push or hit a youth is unsubstantiated.

Youth interviews could not recall specific details, such as who else was present, date and time of the alleged allegation.

Staff denied any wrongdoing and stated that \"youth make daily allegations towards the staff.Staff expressed facility's policies regarding respectful communication with youth placed in their care.

LPA told HR that according to STRTP ILS having all children be subject to a facility's uniform rewards/punishment system isn't trauma-informed because it's not individualized care (as required by 87072.2) and it erroneously assumes all children respond to the system the same way. The facility has to make an individual assessment and take into account the child's history/trauma responses/triggers, as well as their strengths and what sort of discipline works best for them. 87001(t)(3) \"Trauma-informed\" means prevention services, that proactively provide program models, interventions, practices, services, and supports that acknowledge, seek to understand, recognize, and respond to the varying impacts and effects of all types of trauma on children, nonminor dependents, their families, and those who have contact with the child welfare system. In accordance with recognized principles of a trauma-informed approach and trauma-specific interventions, trauma-informed programs recognize the impact of trauma on a child's or nonminor dependent's development and implements individualized interventions to address trauma's consequences and facilitate healing, as specified in Section 87078.2. 87078. TRAUMA-INFORMED INTERVENTIONS AND TREATMENT PRACTICES (a) A program that is trauma-informed shall include curricula, training, interventions, policies, practices and procedures which include the following:(2) Prevention services, interventions, practices, services and supports that demonstrate the following:(E) How individualized strategies for trauma-specific interventions address trauma's consequences and facilitate healing, and can be implemented in components including, but not limited to, the needs and services plan and treatment plan and how these strategies are implemented by direct care staff pursuant to provisions set forth in Section 87022.1(a)(2)(D); and (F) Minimization of any potential for re-traumatization.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews reveal that the clients were observed smoking marijuana outside the facility. Clients refused redirection from staff then started verbally and physically assaulting two staff. Staff defended themselves by attempting containment and avoided further conflict by walking towards the staff office. There were no other staff or clients who witnessed the full incident, but one client recalled observing the client/victim physically assaulting a staff, and staff kicked the client to stop client's continued physical assault on staff. Clients continued with their physical assault of staff until staff was able to contact law enforcement. Paramedics responded to treat the client/victim who was bleeding from the nose and mouth when law enforcement arrived, but client refused medical care. There was no mark or injury observed on the client/victim's stomach. Additional information revealed that the client/victim was purposely hit in the face by the other client so they can put the blame on staff when law enforcement arrived. Although there is a five second video showing the client/victim with blood from the nose, it cannot be determined from the video if the client was spitting blood from the mouth or was spitting blood that dripped from the nose to the mouth. The video did not show how this injury was sustained by the client/victim. Records show that there was no indication of any physical abuse by staff to clients. Staff were protecting themselves from being repeatedly assaulted by the clients. Furthermore, there was evidence found that one of the clients also vandalized the vehicles of the staff. In regard to the alleged theft by staff, LPA was informed that the facility provides for the meals of staff who work at the facility. Staff either bring their own meals or partake from the meals they cook for the clients. Staff and clients eat together and none of the clients had any issues with this until one of the two clients involved came into placement. Interviews obtained did not provide any corroborating evidence of theft. Based on information obtained during the investigation, there was no preponderance of evidence found to support the allegations, so the allegations are unsubstantiated.

The LPA observed no history in the Licensing System indicating that Ref. #2's submitted fingerprints for a criminal record review. Guardian observed that Ref. #2's Live Scan was uploaded on February 8, 2023. Guardian indicated that Ref. #2 required a Criminal Record Exemption on April 28, 2023 via correspondence that was generated and mailed to Scott's Youth Facility at H St #25, Bakersfield 93301. The HR Manager indicated that all of the mail comes to the Glenwood address and that the corporate address was incorrect. Guardian indicated that Ref. #2 obtained an Exemption Approval October 23, 2023. The LPA obtained evidence that Ref. #2 worked at the facility, because the LPA conducted a telephone interview with Ref. #2 via telephone regarding a complaint against the facility dated June 30, 2023. Based upon this information, there is evidence that Ref. #2 worked at the facility without a criminal record clearance or exemption for approximately 178 days. Ref. #3 worked at the facility without a criminal record clearance or exemption. The LPA observed that Ref. #3 had submitted to a criminal record review and initially obtained fingerprint clearances.

Most children declined to meet with LPA, however, one child who was interviewed denied the allegation and stated that staff are always there to support children in care and denied that staff caused any injuries. It was also alleged staff were verbally abusive to a minor while in care. Staff denied the allegation and had similar statements that staff are not verbally abusive to children, but that one child has been verbally abusive towards staff and other children in the home. Staff stated they redirect children and provide support to other children but that staff continue to work with children in comments that they make to others in the home. Most children denied speaking with LPA, however, two children had similar statements of staff and stated that one child is verbally aggressive and causes problems in the home with staff and other children. Lastly, it was alleged staff are physically abusive to a minor while in care. Staff made similar statements and denied ever physically abusing a child. Staff stated that one child has been physically aggressive towards other children in the home, but that child is redirected to keep their hands to themselves. One child who was interviewed denied staff being physically abusive but had similar statements of staff that one child in the home has been physically aggressive and that staff try their best to redirect the behavior and provide support to remove the aggressive child from the situation or area.

The CEO indicated that there is a rule that law enforcement is not normally called, but they do utilize law enforcement action if necessary and MAB. Allegation #2. There was a statement that a client sleeps in the living room. The investigation revealed that Ref. #14 was sleeping in the living room on occasion, because Ref. #14 was accustomed to having their own bedroom after living in a resource home and Ref. #14 did not like their roommates cleanliness and hygiene.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Moroney conducted an investigation into the previously mentioned allegations. This investigation encompassed a thorough examination of various records, including the children's needs and services plans, medical documentation, incident reports, restraint logs, and interviews with four staff members: S1 and S3 on November 26, 2024; S2 on January 29, 2025; and S4 on February 4, 2025. Additionally, two of the three clients, C2 and C3, were interviewed on January 23, 2025, along with two County Social Workers, CSW1 on January 22, 2025, and CSW2 on January 24, 2025. It is important to note that no statement was obtained from client C1 due to their absence without leave. (Refer to Confidential Names Form LIC 811, dated February 7, 2025.) The Following Allegations were reported: 1. A staff member hit a minor while in care. The Staff (S1, S2, S3, and S4) refuted the claims, asserting that all personnel are trained in trauma-informed care and recognize the significance of fostering a safe and healthy atmosphere within the facility. They noted that there have been no observations of staff mistreating clients, nor have any clients reported instances of misconduct by staff members. Additionally, S1 emphasized that all staff have received training in the Management of Assaultive Behavior (MAB), which is utilized only as a final measure to avert self-harm by clients or serious injury to others. 2. Staff not adequately supervising minors resulting in minor engaging in physical altercation with another minor. The Staff (S1, S2, S3, and S4) refuted the claims made, asserting that there are consistently two or more staff members present to uphold the staff-to-client ratio of 1:4. By adhering to this standard, the staff is able to swiftly address any concerns that may emerge, thereby guaranteeing that all clients obtain the necessary assistance and support customized to their specific requirements. 3. Staff not adequately supervising resulting in minor AWOLing. The staff members, namely S1, S2, S3, and S4, denied the allegations, asserting that they do not operate as a locked facility and that clients are free to leave at their discretion. S1 elaborated that through interactions with clients, staff can deter AWOL behavior by providing verbal guidance and emphasizing the significance of fulfilling their personalized plans, as well as the potential risks associated with leaving the facility. Additionally, the staff offers a variety of activities and seeks to understand the underlying reasons driving a client's desire to be absent without leave (AWOL). All occurrences of AWOL are reported promptly to the relevant support agencies. Furthermore, the accounts given by C1 and C2 corroborated the above information, indicating that they are receiving adequate support from the staff and feel safe residing in the facility. The statements obtained from CSW1 and CSW2 affirmed that they have no concerns regarding the care and supervision provided to their clients, and their clients have not reported any incidents of misconduct by the facility staff. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore the allegation(s) are found to be unsubstantiated.

Staff shoved a minor into a closet. The staff members (S1, S2, S3, and S4) denied the allegation, asserting that they were unaware of any such incident occurring and that no client has ever reported such an event to them. S1 emphasized that her team maintains a strong rapport with clients and ensures a safe and healthy atmosphere. The staff noted that while they generally adopt a hands-off approach, they have previously intervened to physically separate clients and escort them to different areas of the facility. Clients C2 and C3 both stated that they had not observed or heard of any staff member mistreating any client. 3. Staff inappropriately restrained a minor. The staff members (S1, S2, S3, and S4) denied the allegations, asserting that all personnel have received training in the Management of Assaultive Behavior (MAB), which is employed solely as a last resort to avert self-injury or harm to others. They further explained that an incident involving C1 transpired after her return from AWOL while under the influence of an unidentified substance. During this incident, staff attempted to confiscate contraband, prompting C1 to bang her head against the door. In response, the staff positioned themselves in front of the door to prevent any potential head injury and subsequently arranged for C1 to receive a medical evaluation from Bakersfield Paramedics. S1 noted that the incident was reported to the relevant supporting agencies without delay. Furthermore, the accounts given by C2 and C3 corroborated the above information, indicating that they are receiving adequate support from the staff and feel safe residing in the facility. The statements obtained from CSW1 and CSW2 affirmed that they have no concerns regarding the care and supervision provided to their clients, and their clients have not reported any incidents of misconduct by the facility staff.

The investigation revealed the following: It was alleged that staff did not prevent a minor from being physically assaulted by another minor and that staff threatened a minor. It was revealed that during a birthday party or celebration event at the facility home, a youth made comments to other youth that were celebrating. These comments were taken as negative by some of the youth in the home. There was a fight that ensued between three (3) youth. After the fight occurred, there was a staff of the facility that threatened to have their child come up to the facility or a youth's school to fight them. LPA reviewed documents including incident reports and notes that revealed the altercation between youth. All three (3) youth interviewed confirmed the fight. One (1) out of three (3) youth interviewed confirmed that a youth was threatened by staff. LPA interviewed five (5) staff, and all five (5) staff were aware of the altercation between youth. Staff interviewed did not hear the threat made from staff to youth. Staff were interviewed and said that the fight was broken up when first made aware. Further, staff said that the allegation of staff threatening a youth was not known until a week after the fight, during a CFT meeting. Staff admitted that the statement made by the youth was not reported to CCL, and only reported to the County.

The Department investigated allegations that staff at the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) failed to seek medical treatment for a minor, threatened to confiscate the minor's personal item, and did not administer prescribed medications. Three (3) staff members were interviewed for the investigation. 3 staff reported that the youth was offered over-the-counter medication and that an appointment for medical care was arranged the following day. Three (3) out of five (5) youth were interviewed. Interviews were consistent in reporting that staff intervene appropriately during peer altercations, provide over-the-counter medication when needed, and do not confiscate phones or threaten to remove them. Three youths described feeling safe in the home and being able to communicate their needs to staff. The principal youth of the investigation reported receiving over-the-counter medication and being transported to urgent care. Records review confirmed that no incident reports were generated by STRTP staff. Stakeholder reports revealed that the principal youth was being provided over-the-counter medication when she felt ill, and that staff transported her to urgent care. Based on the interviews and records reviewed, the allegations are unsubstantiated. The evidence demonstrates that staff responded to the youth's medical concerns by offering over-the-counter medication and arranging follow-up care through urgent care services. Neither interviews nor records supported claims that staff threatened to confiscate the youth's personal belongings or failed to administer prescribed medication. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. LPA Martinez conducted an exit interview and provided a signed LIC 9099 to the facility representative.",

Based on confidential interviews and inspection observations, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined that the facility did not replace minor's bed frame in a timely manner and the facility was unkept. Therefore, the allegations are substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards version 5, 87088(c)(1) Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment, and Supplies and Title 22. Division 6, 80087(c) Building and Grounds. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report and LIC 9099d was provided to Jeanette Hefner. During the investigation, there was no corroborating evidence to support the above allegations. Confidential interviews revealed conflicting statements. Confidential witnesses informed LPA that facility staff provided all the clients backpacks and all the necessary school supplies. Additionally, LPA was informed that two clients C1 and C3 sold the backpacks that they were provided online and when the facility offered to replace the backpack, C1 declined the offer. Other confidential witnesses stated that the facility provided the clients with some of the necessary school supplies but no all the school supplies. Regarding the allegation that the facility did not prevent mold from growing in the refrigerator confidential witnesses informed LPA that the facility kitchen and refrigerator were always clean, and mold had not been observed in the refrigerator. Additionally, LPA was informed that clients were asked to clean up after themselves but if they failed to do so staff would clean. Other confidential witnesses informed LPA that they had observed mold in the refrigerator. LPA observed the kitchen and refrigerator to be free from mold. In regard to the allegation that the facility was not providing mental health care to the clients, confidential witnesses informed LPA that the facility had mental health care staff available to the clients. Additionally, LPA was informed by confidential witnesses that mental health services were offered to the clients but many of the clients refused the services. Another confidential witness informed LPA that some clients were offered mental health care services and other clients were not. LPA received conflicting information regarding this allegation. In relation to the allegation that facility staff did not cook dinner for the clients. Confidential witnesses informed LPA that facility staff always cooked for the clients and staff attempted to follow the menu as closely as possible. Other confidential witnesses informed LPA that the facility staff would not always cook and would encourage clients to cook dinner but some of the clients did not like when their peers cooked the meals. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that the facility did not supply a client with school supplies (backpack), there was mold in the kitchen refrigerator, the facility was not providing mental health care to the clients, and facility staff did not cook dinner for the clients may have occurred, however, they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. (...) An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was provided to Jeanette Hefner.",

Regarding the allegation that the facility was purchasing spoiled fruit, confidential witnesses stated that the facility purchased fruit that was of low quality and would mold within a day of being purchased. Other confidential witnesses stated that the facility would purchase fruit that the clients did not eat and would eventually mold. Additionally, LPA was informed that all moldy and spoiled fruit was thrown out. LPA was unable to gather additional information.

LPA attempted to conduct an interview with client #4 (C4) however, C4 declined to be interviewed. In regard to the investigation that staff are not ensuring education stability for minor in care, confidential interviews stated that C1 attends an independent study program that does not require C1 to be at school daily. Confidential interviews continued stating that whenever C1 wakes up and indicates to staff that C1 is ready staff would transport C1 to school. Other confidential interviews stated that C1 is not attending school as required based on C1's enrollment paperwork agreement. Confidential interviews further stated that when school staff attempted to reach the STRTP program staff to discuss C1's academic needs staff have not been responsive. Confidential interviews further stated that although C1's school program is not attendance base C1 is required to be present at school four times each week. Another confidential interview stated that C1 is not at school regularly due to health-related issues and because at times staff have refused to provide C1 with transportation. Another confidential interview stated that C1 admitted to making false statements about the school schedule and stated that staff did not question C1 because C1 is on top of schoolwork. Confidential interview continued stating that there have been occasions when staff do procrastinate to pick up C1 from school that has resulted in C1 becoming anxious while waiting for transportation. Another confidential interview stated not being aware that staff are not providing educational stability for C1 while in care. Confidential interview further stated that CSW recently learned that C1 is doing really well in school. Confidential interview also stated that a reason that C1 misses school can be a result of C1's absent without leave (AWOL) status. Another confidential interview witnessed staff refusing to take C1 to school and staff could not provide C1 with a reason for the refusal. Another confidential interview stated not knowing if staff provide clients with educational stability due to not being enrolled in school yet. LPA was provided inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Regarding the allegation that staff are not ensuring that minor is fed while in care, confidential interviews stated that C1 informed school staff that C1 had not eaten food in three days. Confidential interviews further stated that when school staff attempted to feed C1, C1 gagged and did not appear to be feeling well. Other confidential interviews stated that C1 was observed by program staff refusing to eat despite staff encouragement. Confidential interviews further stated that program staff informed C1's therapist about C1's refusal to eat. Another confidential interview stated that C1 refused to eat due to not feeling well. Confidential interview denied that program staff were not providing C1 with meals while in care. Other confidential interviews stated that there is food at the facility, and that staff occasionally cook warm meals for clients in care. Another confidential interview maintained that program staff did make the therapist aware that C1 was refusing to eat. Confidential interview further stated that following a school incident C1 was being monitored by program staff more frequently. Confidential interview further denied that staff refused to provide C1 with food while in care. LPA received inconsistent information regarding the allegation. Based on the confidential interviews, and record review the allegations that staff are not ensuring educational stability for C1 while in care, and that staff are not ensuring C1 is fed while in care, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that staff did not prevent a minor from being physically abused, it was alleged that a minor hit another minor repeatedly in the face with a closed fit and pulled their hair while the minor was sitting on the front seat of the facility's vehicle. During the investigation, a confidential interview stated that C1 was seated inside the STRTP vehicle, waiting for S1 to return, while speaking with their social worker. At that time, C2 exited the STRTP, pulled C1's hair and initiated a physical altercation. The same interview reported that C1 called out for S1, but S1 did not hear. Another confidential interview stated that C1 refused to exit the vehicle because they had already planned to go out for dinner. S1 was inside the STRTP to address C2 and C3, who had recently returned from running away, and to document the incident in the logbook. While S1 was inside, C2 went outside again and attacked C1. Furthermore, it was reported that while C1 was inside the STRTP vehicle discussing C2's biological mother, C2 exited the facility and engaged C1 in a physical altercation without S1's knowledge. A confidential interview stated that S1 could not leave the facility with C1 because C2 and C3 had recently returned form runaway. This let C1 be upset and refuse to exit the vehicle. The same interview indicated that S1 moved in and out of the STRTP, but ultimately C1 refused to leave the vehicle despite encouragement. Additionally, S1 went back inside to contact the facility manager, at which point C2 struck C1. Reports indicate that S1 did not observe the physical contact or injuries on C1. When S1 was later informed that C2 had struck C1, S1 observed C1 with a flushed face while C1 remained seated with their seat belt on and no sign of distress was observed. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that staff (S1) did not prevent client #1(C1) from being physically abused may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the alleged violation. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, Appeal Rights, and LIC811 were provided to Ashton Porter via email due to technical difficulties.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation staff handled minor in a rough manner resulting in injury, it was alleged that a staff member put hand around a client's neck and a client began to hit staff as the client felt threatened by staff. During the investigation, a confidential interview stated that staff #1(S1) and client #1(C1) were going back and forth over keeping the light on or off in C1's bedroom and S1 slapped C1's hand and put S1's hands around C1's neck. The same interview reported that C1 punched S1 and S1 slammed C1 to the ground. Another confidential interview stated that S1 was trying to supervise the clients inside of C1's bedroom because C3 had sneaked into the STRTP during late hours from the other STRTP Stella Maris Growth Center III. The same interview reported that S1 had already called law enforcement due to C2 being there but wanted the lights on in the room to supervise the clients. The interview continued by stating that the clients turned the light off in the room and S1 turned the light back on at one-point S1 and C1 were turning the light on and off and C1 slapped S1 on the hand. Furthermore, it was reported that S1 turned the light on again and C1 started to punch S1 and grab S1 by S1's hair. S1 slipped from the ice on the floor and C1 and S1 were on the floor while S1 was trying to get C1 to calm down. CSW stated that she received inconsistent information regarding the allegation.

In regard to the allegation that staff engaged in verbal altercation with minor, it was reported that staff engaged in an argument with a client regarding keeping the bedroom light on. A confidential interview indicated that S1 and C1 argued back and forth about the light but denied that it constituted a verbal alteration. Another interview described the situation as a power struggle between S1 and C1 over turning the light on and off. A separate interview reported no yelling from S1 but confirmed that S1 and C1 argued about keeping the bedroom light off.

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. Lpa L. Rogers observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

    "narrative": "On March 24, 2025, at 9:30AM, LPA initiated the investigation at the STRTP and interviewed Facility Manager. There were no immediate deficiencies observed. In addition, LPA Caballero visited the facility to conduct more interviews, and no immediate deficiencies were observed. During the investigation, LPA Caballero interviewed clients (C1, C3 and C4), two staff, and a County Social Worker. Client #5 declined an interview and Client #2's whereabouts were unknown due to C2's runaway status. LPA reviewed pertinent documents from clients' files. Regarding the allegations that staff did not prevent the minor from causing self-harm and staff did not prevent minor from possibly engaging in CSEC activity, it was alleged that a client was being a danger to self and that a client engaged in prostitution and had unprotected sex with older individuals. There were no further details regarding the alleged violations. During the investigation, a confidential interview stated that staff handled suicidal ideations well and that STRTP staff would send a therapist to talk to client #1(C1) when needed or to the office for supervision. Another confidential interview reported that clients have therapy, and it is a place to stop and speak about clients' emotions. One confidential interview stated that C1 did not self-harm in the STRTP, but the incident occurred outside during the runaway. Furthermore, it was reported that C1 would run away from days at a time and it was hard to pinpoint where C1 attempted self-harm. Other confidential interviews refused to disclose information about C1's CSEC activity. Another confidential interview reported that C1 began to open to staff about prostitution and needed to make more money, but C1 still was reluctant to talk about runaway activity outside of the STRTP. County Social Worker stated that they did not have major concerns about the care and supervision of staff. County social worker stated that C1 showed signs of prostitution here and there but C1 was introduced to trap homes when placed at this STRTP by client #2(C2). In regard to the allegation staff did not provide adequate supervision of minors in care, it was reported that a client was observed with bruises. A confidential interview stated that supervision in the STRTP was adequate with room checks every fifteen to twenty minutes. The same interview refused to provide information regarding the bruises on client #1(C1). Another confidential interview stated that C1 would run away from days at a time and it was difficult for C1 to open about things that happened outside of the STRTP. One confidential interview stated the supervision in the STRTP is adequate because staff conduct room checks. Another confidential interview disclosed that staff have activities for clients in care like Knotts Berry Farm, Soak City, pool parties, and other winter activities. Other confidential interviews did not have information regarding the alleged violation. A confidential interview reported that most of the time staff did not know that C1 was going to do harm but refused to disclose any information regarding the bruises on C1's body. County Social Worker stated that they did not have major concerns about the care and supervision of staff. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that staff did not prevent client #1(C1) from causing self-harm, staff did not prevent C1 from possibly engaging in Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children activities (CSEC), and staff did not provide adequate supervision to C1 may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the alleged violations. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, Appeal Rights, and LIC811 were provided to Ashton Porter via email due to technical difficulties.",

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed that the facility reported that Ref. #4 and #5 would come to the facility with different bicycles. It revealed that the facility reported that on one occasion Ref. #4 and #5 threw rocks at cars and were chased by a driver while away from the facility without permission. The investigation revealed that the facility reported while Ref. #5 left the facility without permission, Ref. #5 was hit by a train while intoxicated causing a small injury. It revealed that the facility provided first aid, but Ref. #5 refused to go to Urgent Care. A review of the reports indicating law enforcement involvement indicates that the facility followed their Runaway (AWOL) Plan as it relates to Procedures for Responding to a Runaway Youth. The reports indicated that according to the Procedures staff talked to Ref. #5 and offered alternatives, such as accompanying the staff to the park or swimming, instead of leaving without permission. An interview with the Probation Officer (PO) revealed that the PO had no concerns about the facility. The PO indicated that Ref. #5 was a chronic runaway, and constantly used drugs and alcohol. Interviews with the other witnesses and Ref. #5, revealed that Ref. #5 was intoxicated by liquor or high on drugs on more than one occasion. It revealed that when staff attempted to engage Ref. #5 or confiscate liquor bottles in Ref. #5's possession, Ref. #5 would leave without permission. The investigation revealed that the facility provided Ref. # Core Services and Trauma-Informed Care Services with their mental health personnel, but Ref. #5 would not engage with the therapists. The investigation revealed that on one occasion the facility requested that the Probation Department search Ref. #5's physical person, but nothing was found. It revealed that on one occasion staff searched Ref. #5's bedroom and found one empty liquor bottle. The LPA was unable to corroborate the allegations. Based upon the above, it is determined that there is no preponderance of evidence to substantiate that the facility did not properly supervise Ref. #5; did not prevent Ref. #5 from bringing alcohol into the facility; nor report incidents that occur at the facility to the appropriate parties. So, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding this complaint. A copy of this report was emailed to the facility representative.",

    "narrative": "On January 9, 2025, as C1 was preparing for school, he was walking around with his phone, speaking softly to himself. At that moment, he encountered S1 and S3, informing them that they had been sexually assaulted earlier that morning while they were asleep. C1 was unable to provide any information regarding the alleged assailant and declined medical assistance. S1 reported that the Bakersfield Police had been informed, and soon after, Officer Nelson arrived at the STRTP to converse with C1; however, the information given by C1 was inconsistent, as C1 claimed that the sexual assault had been happening for the last eight months yet had only been living in the STRTP for two weeks. Because C1 provided conflicting details and declined to pursue medical assistance, Officer Nelson consulted with the staff and then left the STRTP. The staff members (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the allegation, asserting that all personnel are trained in trauma-informed care and recognize the significance of upholding a secure and healthy atmosphere for every client. S3 stated that on the night of the alleged incident, they were the only staff member on duty. They described the night as calm and confirmed that no one entered or exited the facility during that time. S3 expressed surprise at what C1 had reported the following morning. S2, the Head of Service, indicated that they have tried to arrange meetings with C1 three to four times weekly; however, C1 often rejected these meeting requests. Furthermore, S2 mentioned that they provided both individual and group therapy sessions and had enrolled C1 in a substance abuse program, due to C1's history of substance abuse, yet C1 has declined to participate in these sessions. S2 also disclosed that C1 frequently suffered from hallucinations triggered by this substance use, which intensified as C1 increasingly went AWOL. Information gathered from the PO indicated that C1 has a background of substance abuse and may exhibit delusional behavior at times. Before C1's absence without leave from the STRTP on January 21, 2025, they had made allegations of sexual abuse. These allegations were communicated to the relevant authorities, and C1 was referred for a medical evaluation at Urgent Care, where no irregularities were detected. Additionally, confidential statements obtained from facility clients refuted the allegation, asserting that they have never witnessed or heard of any staff behaving inappropriately with clients and that they are consistently monitored by staff. Clients also reported having access to mental health services and programs, and stated that they have no concerns regarding the care and supervision they receive. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation(s) occurred, therefore, the allegation(s) are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the STRTP Facility Manager. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time.

It is also facility policy to walk clients out of the facility when they leave, and to shadow them if clients AWOL. Since C1 was leaving and AWOLing without a pass S3 was sent to walk the client out and shadow. C1 and S3 soon returned, and S3 said C1 agreed to make their room safe first and go out on a pass. Then, when the elevator stopped, S3 stepped in between the doors to hold them open. C1 then hit S3 with an open hand. One staff member shared that \"I saw the event happen live on the cameras. I think there was a mis-communication on whether S3 and C1 were returning to get a pass or clean the room. I don't think S3 was acting maliciously, and I think C1 just got overemotional and lost control of herself.\" LPA attempted to interview S3, but S3 declined and stated that they would only speak through their attorney. LPA was given the attorney's contact information and made multiple attempts to interview the attorney, but they never responded. LPA was shown the video interaction of the event in question. LPA observed, C1 and S3 enter the elevator. S3 pressed the buttons on the elevator. During the elevator ride C1 and S3 were talking with each other. The video did not have sound so their conversation was not heard. When the elevator reached its stop and opened the doors S3 stepped out and held the elevator door open for C1. C1 proceeded to step out and hit S3 with their left hand in an open palm. C1 and S3 continued talking and exited the elevator. LPA received conflicting testimonies regarding the incident in the elevator and staff's interaction with the client. The complaint alleges that S3 held C1 hostage and prevented C1 from leaving the elevator, resulting in an inappropriate interaction with the client. Staff testimonies stated that S3 was not acting maliciously and was following facility policies and procedures to shadow the client during AWOL's and to encourage room safety. LPA observed the video of the incident, and it did not appear as if S3 was trying to block or impede C1, though there was no audio available. LPA was also unable to gain facts from those involved due to the decline and refusal of interviews. . Based on the available information, LPA gathered from interview evidence from staff and clients, and from observations and video evidence review the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation that \"Staff had inappropriate interaction with minor.\" is found to be unsubstantiated.

S3 then used their body to block the elevator and stop C1 from leaving. C1 felt like they were being held hostage and slapped S3. C1 then exited the elevator and ran from the facility.

The investigation was completed by CCIB Investigator Shannan Borton. During the course of the investigation, the Investigator interviewed the foster youth C1 (see LIC811 dated 1/6/2021), staff, and other youth at the facility, and reviewed records, including the police report done by the Marin County Sheriff's Office. While C1 apparently did have activity involving child pornography, there was no indication that there was any effect or participation on the part of the other youth in the facility, nor was there any indication of a lack of appropriate supervision.

LPA Segura sent Director of Continuous Quality Improvement Bill Webster and Director of Client Services Sarah Burton and Administrator Ann Anderson a Document Request checklist on 04/14/2021. LPA received client documents via email on 04/27/2021. The facility has 39 clients in placement at this time. LPA requested to review 10 files of children who are taking psychotropic medications. LPA met with Client Services Director Sarah Burton, Director of Continuous Quality Improvement Bill Webster and facility Nurse Kathi Buada. LPA Segura and two student assistants reviewed the child files. Review of the files revealed that the following items were observed to be out of compliance. Below LPA will reference each child file as C1 through C10, see confidential name list LIC 811 dated 05/11/2021. C1-10: Psychotropic Medication Administration Records were missing the number of refills as required by ILS (Interim Licensing Standard) 87070. C1, C3, C No Indication the child is participating or offered to participate in the development of their ANSP (Assessment Needs and Services Plan) as required by ILS 87068. C1 - C Services not identified in the ANSP as required by ILS 87068.2. The ILS requires the facility include the types of services necessary, including core services, supports, physical and mental health, substance abuse services and permanency and transition services. Out of the 10 files reviewed, only the ANSP for C10, detailed the services to be provided to the child. Note the facility did submit evidence all children are receiving services; however, these are not noted in the ANSP. Continued on 809C C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C Assessment Needs and Services Plan (ANSP) not signed by the child, authorized representative or both. C2, C5, C7, Current court or parental authorization for psychotropic medication not present in the child's file. The facility provided copies of emails sent to the county social workers for their efforts to obtain copies of the court authorization On 05/05/2021 at approximately 9am LPA Segura and facility Nurse Kathi Buada conducted a medication count at the four homes; Mitty, Riordan, Hanna and McKenna. The medication count was conducted via Facetime. The facility uses a pharmacy that bubble packs their medication which made viewing the medication more convenient. LPA conducted the count by counting when the medication was started according to the centrally stored log and counted how many pills should remain on 05/05 when the inspection was conducted. Medication will be referenced as M1, 2, 3... etc (medication will be listed on confidential name list LIC811, dated 05/11/2021). The following was observed during the medication count: Hanna: C1 - \u00b7 9:45am medication count was found to be correct. C4 - \u00b7 9:30am M1 was found to have extra two pills that could not be accounted for through the PMAR or centrally stored medication log Mitty: C2 - \u00b7 1:30pm M2 was found to have 2 extra pills that could not be reconciled from the PMAR (Psychotropic Medication Administration) or centrally stored log. C8 - \u00b7 Medication count was found to be correct C10 - \u00b7 1:15pm M1 count found one extra pill that could not be accounted for in the PMAR or centrally stored log Riordan: C3 - \u00b7 8:50am M1 was in a liquid form, unable to conduct a pill count. Other medications count were found to be correct. C9 - \u00b7 9am medication count was found to be correct. McKenna: C5 - \u00b7 Medication count was found to be correct C6 - \u00b7 M1 was found to have an extra 3 pills. M2 had correct amount of pills remaining; however, facility staff were not documenting pills given to the child on the PMAR, meaning they were not signing when pills were dispensed to the child. C7 - \u00b7 Medication Count was found to be correct On 05/06/ LPA Segura reviewed 3 staff files and did not observe any deficiencies. Staff interviews were conducted on 05/05/2021 at approximately 10am -11am.

LPA informed Ms. Randle that the visit is related to three incident reports. The first report is dated 5/23/21 regarding C1 (see LIC811 dated 7/28/21) who reportedly is engaging in a relationship with an unidentified male, age 19. LPA informed Ms. Randle that additional information is needed on this issue and Licensing is questioning if the agency did their due diligence in reporting this information to law enforcement, child protective services or any other agency as required according to the Mandated Reporting Policy? Ms. Randle states that the agency did contact the biological mother and did obtain additional information that was not provided in the report sent to Licensing. Ms. Randle shall ensure that the report is updated with the additional information and resubmitted to Licensing. The second report is dated 5/24/21 and is related to C2 attempting to have an inappropriate conversation with another youth about two other youth in the facility. When staff intervened in this conversation, C2 alerted facility staff that two youth were engaging in inappropriate touching and possible sexually inappropriate boundaries between these two other youth. The report does not detail who the clients involved are, what steps the facility staff were taking to ensure the safety of youth or what the outcome of the incident were. LPA asked that Ms. Randle provide additional information and resubmit this incident report to ensure that all details and information are on the report as required. The third report is dated 5/25/21 and this is related to C3 and S1 having \"inappropriate conversations through social media (Twitter)\". LPA informed Ms. Randle that the report states that there were attached documents but that the report was not accompanied by any additional documents. LPA asked Ms. Randle what those documents were and it was reported that the actual conversation between C3 and S1. LPA did request that the attachments be provided to Licensing in addition to the internal investigation conducted by the agency. In addition, LPA has already requested S1's entire employment file as a result of an incident at another facility for this agency. Ms. Randle states that in her opinion, there are items that S1 may have deleted from the conversation in an effort to show that the conversation was not inappropriate. Ms. Randle states that the agency policy regarding contact between staff and clients is that it must be approved through management prior to conversing with youth and that staff cannot, at any time, ask youth for their social media contact(s). Requests of this nature must be initiated by the youth and a team discussion and approval provided prior to contact with youth but staff employed by the agency. S1 violated this policy and was terminated by the agency. Exit interview conducted and document provided.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) made an unannounced call on 10/28/20 at 2: PM and met with Michelle Good, Director of Residential Programs to discuss some concerns. LPA asked Ms. Good about the houses and the plan when the houses lose power due to Pacific Gas & Electric shut-offs when the winds are especially high, increasing fire danger in the area. Ms. Good states that the facility plan is still to acquire the generators so as to now have to rotate the facilities to other facilities to complete hygiene tasks for the youth. Ms. Good states that the plan for the generators is a costly plan and they are still working to acquire the generators for the sites but that there are at least one or two facilities that still have power when the power is shut off in the other houses and that youth are rotated in to those houses. LPA did ask that an emergency plan be submitted to explain how the facility continues to operate with the power out. This plan should address meal preparation, hygiene, bathroom facilities use when use of a well is required and not functioning, schooling, activities, etc. LPA also is requesting that a plan for the purchase or acquiring of the generators be provided as it appears that this is going to be an on-going issue that needs a long-term solution. LPA also inquired about searches and the policy surrounding conducting searches in the home and Ms. Good states that the protocol is usually to notify youth's placement that a search is needed and the reasons for the need to search. Ms. Good states that usually they wait for consent from placement prior to initiating the search unless the search is requested by placement. Ms. Good states that if they have suspicions of dangerous items, they do not wait for permission to search but that placement is notified when a search is conducted and what the result of the search was. Ms. Good states that it is always best practice to conduct searches when youth are present but that sometimes when youth leave the facility on an unauthorized absence or youth are otherwise unable to or unwilling to be present, then the search is conducted without youth presence. Ms. Good states that it is always the procedure to complete an incident report immediately following searches and provide those reports to placement and Licensing as required. LPA did discuss that she has received notices of the searches in the past but that she does not recall a recent search conducted and an incident report being submitted recently. Ms. Good states that she will follow up on this and provide additional information once obtained. LPA also asked Ms. Good about chores being requested of the youth while at the non-public school site and Ms. Good reports that chores are required of the youth at this site but that they are normal chores and nothing too in-depth that they are being asked to complete. LPA asked what kinds of things are asked of the youth and Ms. Good states that tasks such as wiping of desks, taking out classroom trash, vacuuming of classrooms, etc. are asked of youth. LPA asked if youth are asked to clean the bathroom at the site as well and Ms. Good confirmed that they are asked to do normal cleaning of the youth bathrooms. LPA did inform Ms. Good that this is inappropriate and that there should be janitorial staff that conduct this type of cleaning at this site. Ms. Good states that she would take this up with the leadership team and discuss an appropriate plan to address this. LPA did request that the facility provide some kind of feedback on the issue surrounding chores at the non-public school site.",

When staff attempted to suggest to C1 some self help remedies for the pain, C1 rejected the suggestions and instead took the house phone and went outside to make an unauthorized phone call. C1 was supervised while outside by S2. S1 unplugged the phone from inside the facility to prevent C1 from making any calls. When the call could not be made, C1 entered the facility angry and screaming about the phone not working and S1 responded to C1 that it was because C1 did not show the staff the number dialed and because C1 was attempting to have an unauthorized call. C1 demonstrated to staff that they had dialed 911. LPA advised Ms. Randle that instead of S1 speaking to C1 in a trauma informed manner and attempting to de-escalate youth, S1 was very antagonistic and provoking toward C1. LPA reminded Ms. Randle that the facility staff need to be reminded about the obligation to approach youth in a trauma informed manner and speak to youth in a way that would de-escalate situations and not cause more trauma or escalate youth. Ms. Randle states that she was not even aware of the incident and that she would look further into this issue and provide an update regarding this incident. LPA requested that the update, counseling note or other documentation related be provided to LPA by 8/11/21. Exit interview conducted and document provided.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced collateral inspection on 6/9/22 at 9: AM to the administrative office located at Placerville Drive, Placerville to discuss incident reports. LPA discussed the following incident reports while at the administrative office: 5/2/22 - C1 appeared to have been targeting a staff (unclear as to what staff) and it does not appear in the report that staff removed themselves knowing that C1 was targeting them. LPA discussed with CEO that in writing the reports, if staff are switched out then it need to be articulated. If the staff targeted in this incident did not remove themselves, the staff should be cognizant of the target and in the future remove themselves when a youth appears to be targeting them. 4/23/22 - C2 allegedly snorted a substance but the substance was never defined in the report. C2 informed staff that it was a substance that came from a previous client but there is no indication that the substance was searched for or if C2 was ever asked if there was more \"substance\". 4/19/22 - C2 was involved in two restraints at the facility and as written, both incidents appear to be unnecessary restraints. LPA informed Ms. Gleason that Licensing is looking at restraints and the \"eminent danger\" presented when restraining a youth in care. LPA informed Ms. Gleason that the reports need to articulate the danger(s) presented that warrant a restraint when they do happen. 4/15/22, C1 attempted to leave a classroom while at the school site and were stopped by staff resulting in youth being violent and aggressive towards various staff in the classroom and additional staff that came to support the incident. LPA cautioned Ms. Gleason on stopping youth when they are leaving as this may be a personal rights violation. In addition, it was discussed that there are alternatives to youth being physically stopped including assigning a staff to walk about the property with youth. 3/5/ C3 was placed in a restraint to keep youth from jumping out of a window on a second level of the facility after breaking into a locked storage cabinet in the garage and being able to obtain razors. Staff held on to C3's wrists to get items from C3. LPA again cautioned the use of restraints in an unauthorized manner. 3/5/ C4 was found in a bathtub \"unconscious\" and when pulled out by staff, it took C4 a minute to respond. C4 was taken to the local emergency room and subsequently returned to the facility. When discussing the incident, CEO states that she learned that youth never lost consciousness, per the doctor. LPA informed CEO that any and all additional information needs to be put in the full report. 3/2/ C3 was again placed in a restraint to keep youth from exiting the house through the bedroom window. LPA cautioned CEO about the incident in that it does not appear that there was an eminent danger to the youth that would justify the use of restraints. 3/1/ C4 was on the roof of the house and staff were \"collecting couches\" as described in the incident report. LPA questioned what this meant and CEO states that to the best of her knowledge, it means that staff were putting couches together to break a youth's fall/jump from the roof. LPA indicated that there was no discussion of de-escalation techniques used to get youth to come of the roof and not jump. 2/28/ C4's room was searched due to how C4 \"was presenting\" and due to disclosure of using substances while in their home but this is not a justification for a search. LPA advised Ms. Gleason that searches need justification and consent. There is also no indication that parent/guardian was consulted. Later on this date, C4 attempted to leave the facility but was restrained; no indication this was necessary. 9/10/ C5 did a \"smiley\" piercing while in the facility; there's no indication when this happened and no indication that staff asked C5 about when it happened or what was used to do the piercing. LPA asked Ms. Gleason if there was more information about how this could happen without staff being aware. In general, LPA also discussed with Ms. Gleason the need to ensure that all reports are complete. LPA also advised that some of the full reports just need additional information to indicate that the staff are being proactive in preventing additional issues; i.e. one youth making calls to get someone to pick them up at the facility but not indicating what staff are doing for additional support or assistance. LPA also discussed accompanying youth when needed to do a walk-about on the property of the school or the facility grounds. There were incidents where youth were struggling and staff would not allow them to leave and other times where youth were struggling and staff allowed them to leave unattended. In both incidents, it was a struggle for the staff and clients. LPA advised that it is necessary to be consistent with the youth in order to maintain supervision and be consistent. LPA also discussed being thorough in the reports and providing additional information it the 24 hour reports being sent. Reports should include when medical is needed or not, contacting therapists when necessary, indicating what interventions or supports are utilized when youth indicate self-harm, what youth are doing (other than just stating \"engaged in self harm\"), use of restraints when there is not an eminent threat or danger, staff indicating completion of Suspected Child Abuse Report when disclosures are made by the youth in care, indicating reasons for and what is found when a room search is needed/warranted. Also discussed during the inspection on this date was the licensing fees that are all confused and not appropriated correctly. LPA did advise that the agency provide details about the fee assessments via email so that discussion can be held with the Department's Accounting Unit to appropriate the fees paid appropriately. LPA did ask additional information be provided for the following incidents regarding allegations with staff: 11/30/ LPA asked for clarification on this incident involving two staff and four youth in the facility. LPA requested any/all follow up regarding S1 having to be told by S2 to \"remove herself and stay outside\". LPA observed that the incident report indicates that S1 yelled at C6 \"Do not touch me\" when C6 pushed S1 back with their body. 11/29/ LPA requested additional information regarding alleged misconduct of S1 where S1 may have provided a vape pen to C4. LPA asked if there was an internal investigation regarding the incident and, if so, LPA requested a copy of the internal investigation conducted. 5/31/ C5 alleged that a staff had provided \"vape juice\" to a youth in the facility (staff not identified). LPA is requesting a copy of the investigation conducted. End of incident report review and exit interview conducted with Ms. Gleason.",

Another staff accompanied by another client walked down the driveway in the direction that it was thought that S1 and C1 had walked in and rustling was heard in the woods. C2 allegedly saw S1 and C1 on the ground together. C1 initially told staff and clients that nothing happened because C1 didn't want to get into trouble but later stated that S1 and C1 did have sex in the woods as suspected and that it was not all consensual. While Investigators with the Department and Detective from El Dorado County Sheriff's Office did attempt to make contact with S1, S1 would not agree to an interview and would not agree to a meeting to discuss the allegation. S1 informed the investigators and detective that S1 would need to contact their attorney to discuss and get back to the investigators. As of the finalization of the complaint, S1 had not come forward to schedule a meeting of any kind. Based on information obtained and interviews conducted by the Investigations Branch, the allegation that a staff sexually abused a minor while in care is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met.

The staff member of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) engaged in inappropriate sexual acts with a minor client of the STRTP. On August 26, 2022, LPA Tamara Hill delivered findings for a complaint investigation regarding the allegation that \"staff sexually abused a minor while in care\". Based on information gathered during confidential interviews it was determined the allegation of sexual abuse is substantiated. A staff member sexually abused a minor in care. This abuse is conduct inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of clients in the STRTP. The Department has determined that the Enhanced Civil Penalty is warranted for the physical abuse of a minor while in the care of the STRTP. The violation does meet the definition of Physical Abuse per Health & Safety 1548(e)(2); Physical Abuse to include Sexual Abuse as defined in Penal Codes section 11165.1(b) (1)-(2) describes sexual assault as including penetration, oral copulation, intrusion by one into the genitals of another, and intentional touching for purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty Law, Health & Safety Code section 1548(f)(1)(C) the Department will be issuing an Enhanced Civil Penalty of $2500.

    "narrative": "Interviews revealed that additional comments were said by S1 to other youth in the program about retaliating physically against youth that caused disturbances in the program, wanting to punch youth, or hurting youth enough to \"make them cry\". LPA interviewed a total of four previous staff and seven current staff. In addition, LPA interviewed complainant, three previous youth, one current youth, and C1's therapist at the facility. LPA also obtained an email dated 9/11/2020, detailing that C1 disclosed to her therapist during a session that C1 was feeling uncomfortable about statements and/or gestures made by S1. House Supervisor was pulled into this therapy session to hear youth's concerns; the House Supervisor then reported the information to her manager but that information was not investigated by the agency nor was it reported to Licensing. Shortly after this disclosure, S1 stopped working at the agency. Interviews conducted showed that multiple staff and clients were aware of, had witnessed, or had been told about S1's inappropriate comments about C1 and other inappropriate comments about other youth in the program. In addition, many of the staff disclosed that they reported that S1 displayed \"inappropriate or poor boundaries\" with youth in care, \"acted more like a youth than staff\", allowed youth to utilize their personal cell phone to access social media, watch videos, and listen to music which is a violation of company policy. Despite warnings from management, S1 allegedly continued to engage in this practice. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff member's conduct poses a threat to children in care is SUBSTANTIATED at this time. Facility was cited for violation of Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Section 87072(d): Personal Rights. Youth have a right to live in a safe, healthy, and comfortable home where they are treated with respect. This did not happen as staff and youth were aware that S1's continued present in the facility was making youth uncomfortable. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Gleason and documents were provided via email for signature and return.",

Some of the reported comments were that of a youth's body, how cute youth was, how it was easy to forget youth was a minor, wanting to \"hook up with\" youth after youth left the program and S1 providing youth with their cell personal phone number to contact S1 after leaving the program.

    "narrative": "According to the interviews with staff, video cameras showed that another youth went down the hall and may have observed what C1 was doing in their room and alerted staff. At that point, youth had been alone in their room and not checked on for approximately 47 minutes. Interviews with staff, placement agency, and parent are consistent in that C1 was known to self harm with their own nails and with other objects and needed line of sight supervision or heightened supervision. C1's parent also felt that C1 was in need of heightened supervision and thought that C1 was placed in the facility to receive that level of supervision. Review of the documentation from the hospital demonstrates that the hospital staff believed that C1 had injured themselves over a period of two days as some of the injuries appeared to be infecting and older than others observed. When interviewed, staff state that C1 normally wore long sleeve clothing and did not expose much of their skin so marks of self harm were not visible until entering C1's room and C1 disclosing the injuries. Based on interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the allegation that staff did not prevent youth from self harming is SUBSTANTIATED meaning that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The facility was cited for Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision 80078(a) as the licensee is required to provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. C1's Needs and Services Plan indicates that C1 engages in self harm daily, thus requiring an additional level of supervision that C1 did not receive in the facility, including being left alone for lengthy periods of time, allowing C1 to self harm and cause significant damage to their arm. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Gleason and documents and appeal rights were provided via email. items to the facility for C1, the parent thought that all items would have been inspected and searched and if any item(s) would have been deemed to be dangerous to C1, taken away and stored elsewhere or destroyed. The parent had no knowledge of the search policy in that they were unaware that the child's belongings, person, or room was not searched regularly to keep dangerous items away from C1. The allegation that staff did not seek medical attention for child in a timely manner is related to the severity of the injuries observed at the hospital and the suspicion by the medical staff that some of the wounds were starting to infect, indicating that the wounds happened over a period of 48 hours. During interviews conducted with staff, C1 was known to wear long sleeves which would have hidden the wounds inflicted the day prior. Until C1 was found in their room bleeding from the wounds, staff had no knowledge of existing wounds. As soon as staff saw the wounds, facility staff called 911 and C1 was transported to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Based on investigation, interviews conducted and review of the documentation obtained, the allegation that C1 had access to a dangerous object is true but culpability by the staff to be aware and be able to remove the item is subjective and cannot be proven as youth are to be free of unreasonable searches. The allegation that staff did not seek medical attention for C1 in a timely manner cannot be proven as well since the staff, upon learning of the injury immediately called 911 and had C1 taken to the hospital. As a result, both of these allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Gleason and documents were provided by email.",

C1 was not interviewed in relation to this complaint due to C1's instability in their current placement and C1's parent requested that C1 not be interviewed.

LPA Hill conducted confidential interviews with staff and clients and obtained documentation related to staff supervision during these overnight shifts in the facility. The allegation is directly related to inappropriate contact between C1 and C2 during the overnight shift(s) and the lack of supervision which lead to this.

This lack of bed checks as documented by the facility left clients unsupervised and vulnerable to inappropriate interactions. As a result of the investigation, the allegation that staff did not prevent inappropriate sexual interaction between clients is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met.

While staff may have offered this to youth, this information was not articulated in the report. LPA reminded staff about being trauma informed and documenting interventions as appropriate.

LPA discussed that it has been observed that there is an up-tick in medication related incident indicting that they are either not administered or incorrectly administered doses. LPA advised that the agency needs to do something to ensure that youth are given their medications as prescribed and missing medications for youth is not acceptable. LPA discussed 24 hour reports with the agency as well. LPA pointed out that there are incidents in which there is little to no information about the incidents and why or how things happen.

    "narrative": "happened on 12/9/22 where C1 and C2 left the facility and broke into a neighbor's home and vandalized the home. Investigation showed that there were two staff present at the facility with six clients. When C1 and C2 left the facility on an unauthorized absence, one of the staff were going to follow but then another client, not related to the incident, left the facility on an unauthorized absence as well, and staff followed that third client. While away from the facility, C1 admitted to breaking a neighbor's window in an attempt to burglarize the home but the residents of that home were there, scaring C1 and C2 off, and they fled the neighbor's property. Sheriff deputies did issue felony citations to C1 for the damages and the break in but the clients were not arrested or transported to juvenile hall. During the confidential interviews conducted, it was disclosed that staff observed C1 and C2 were possibly preparing to leave the facility on an unauthorized absence as they were talking about \"getting up and getting ready to go\". Staff indicated that they were on high alert and had alerted the management of the need but they felt that there should have been an additional staff at that facility as C1 had been struggling during the days leading up to this incident. Staff felt that they needed the additional support but the agency didn't provide that additional staff. When LPA Hill reviewed incident reports, it was noted that the day prior to this incident, 12/8/22, C1 had left the facility on an unauthorized absence and went to a different neighbor's house claiming to have killed someone and buried their body as part of a gang initiation. In addition, there was another unauthorized absence on 12/6/22, and two incidents related to inappropriate interactions with two different clients on 12/2/22 and 12/7/22, one of which was a sexual interaction. An additional staff did respond to the facility when summoned after three clients left on an unauthorized absence and this staff person did assist in transporting clients back to the house. While the facility was within the required staff ratio requirements set by Short Term Residential Therapeutic Programs, the facility is also required to meet the needs of the clients in care which would include having additional staff at the facility to assist as needed. As a result of this, the allegation that staff did not provide adequate supervision to the minors is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The facility was cited for violation of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Division 6, Section 80065(a) Personnel Requirements. The facility did not have the necessary staff at the facility to meet the needs of the clients in care in that there were only two staff with the six residents. Staff knew, or should have known, the propensity of the clients and had a sufficient number of staff present to meet that need.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection on 4/13/23 at 9:30 am and met with Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs to discuss incident reports and lack of full reports being received. LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle on 4/6/23 via email that Licensing had not received any of the required full reports for the month of March for the 24 hour reports that were provided. Administrator Danielle Bingle provided those reports for the Month of March on that same date via email. LPA Hill did inform Ms. Bingle and Ms. Randle that the Department still has to cite for not providing the full written report within the required timeline of seven days as prescribed in 80061(b) \"a written report containing the information specified... shall be submitted to the licensing agency within seven days following the occurrence of such event.\" LPA Hill also discussed an incident report dated 3/13/23 for C1 in which C1 allegedly felt uncomfortable sleeping in the same room as their roommate. LPA Hill questioned Ms. Randle about this report as there is no indication of why C1 was uncomfortable, how it was addressed the following day (was C1 referred to their therapist to discuss, were room changes conducted, etc.) After discussing the incident report, Ms. Randle stated that C1 was uncomfortable due to an incident involving two other youth from the same house. LPA Hill asked Ms. Randle to update information on the report to give reasoning, what the facility did, and how the issue was resolved and resubmit the report to Licensing. LPA Hill discussed medication incident reports received since January 1, 2023, detailing medication errors due to medications not being picked up, staff forgetting to administer at time(s) prescribed by doctors or other staff/facility errors. LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that the Department is not concerned for medication errors due to pharmacy not having medications but errors that are within the control of Summitview and staff, are of concern. LPA Hill asked Ms. Randle how the facility has addressed or is planning to address this issue to ensure that there are no medication errors due to staffing and/or Summitview not having the prescribed medications on site? Ms. Randle states that medication training was conducted with all residential staff and the agency has begun to track for medication patterns and staff responsible for any medication errors moving forward will be retrained immediately and/or corrective actions conducted with said staff. In addition, Summitview's Health Services has met with transporters to ensure that refills and notifications are sent to transporters a minimum of seven to ten days prior to medications running out and refill requests are completed. Controlled medications are counted daily and other medications are counted twice weekly. When these counts happen, staff are to notify Health Services for refill of medications a minimum of ten days prior to the medications running out in an effort to prevent the facility from running out of medications. LPA Hill requested a written policy that would indicate how all of these things will be defined and/or put into place shall be provided to Licensing by 5/1/23. Lastly, LPA Hill discussed the closure of this location with Ms. Randle in that the agency has decided to relocate all of the youth from this location by 4/14/23. With the house vacant, the agency has decided to sell the property but will be relocating this facility to another one of their properties currently under renovation. Ms. Randle states that they will be submitting something to Licensing as soon as their board has approved of the plan and provides the board resolution for the relocation. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documentation provided with appeal rights.",

While S1 was smoking in the back seat of their own personal vehicle, the vehicle was still located on the facility grounds. S1 was immediately dismissed from the facility and formally terminated 6/17/21. No youth witnessed S1 smoking or the interaction between S1 and S1's supervisor. During the inspection today, LPA did request a copy of the policy regarding smoking any substance while at the facility or around the facility or some policy that would speak to staff not smoking during the time that they are on the clock or during their work shift; i.e. while on a break, gone to lunch or in their car and away from the facility. LPA did ask if the agency does random drug tests for the staff and Ms. Randle states that they do not currently do random drug testing for the staff.

LPA also discussed with the staff that it has been observed that there is an up-tick in medication incident reports where medications are either not administered or incorrectly administered for doses or medications. LPA advised that the agency needs to do something to ensure that youth are given their medications as prescribed and that missing medications for youth is not acceptable. LPA discussed 24 hour reports with the agency as well. LPA pointed out that there are incidents in which there is little to no information about why a youth is restrained or information is missing that is vital to know on these reports. LPA provided examples of the 24 hour incident reports that need additional information on them so that staff are aware of the missing or incomplete reports.

S1 is a known smoker and C1 alleged that S1 had offered C1 a cigarette but C1 declined. C1 also alleged that S1 does smoke in her personal vehicle as the vehicle did smell of cigarette smoke. Ms. Good states that she recalls this incident and states that S1 was counseled about not using her personal vehicle to transport youth no matter how trivial the need to run and get something. Ms. Good states that when the internal investigation was conducted, S1 denied ever offering any youth her cigarettes at any time and further stated that she would never smoke with youth in her vehicle. LPA interviewed C1 and S1 and concluded that there is not substantial evidence to cite the facility at this time but did caution the facility about the staff smoking in vehicles that are used to transport youth. Ms. Good states that this is the very reason that they have a policy about using the facility vehicles only to transport youth and the staff not transporting youth in their own personal vehicles as they cannot ensure that staff do not smoke in their vehicles.

    "narrative": "On 8/11/22 at AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced collateral case management inspection to the administrative offices for Summitview Child and Family Services and met with Anna Gleason, Chief Executive Officer to assess an Enhanced Civil Penalty for a violation of Personal Rights Section 87072, the licensee shall ensure that each child is accorded personal rights specified in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16001.9, including the right to be free of physical, sexual, emotional, or other abuse and Conduct Inimical, Health & Safety Code Section 1568.092(a)(2), a staff member of the licensed Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) owned and operated by Summitview Child and Family Services engaged in inappropriate sexual acts with a foster child in care. On July 15, 2022, LPA Tamara Hill delivered findings for a complaint investigation at the facility. The complaint investigation revealed that \"staff had an inappropriate sexual relationship with an underage client in care\" and \"staff engaged in an improper sexual relationship with minors in care\". Based on information gathered during confidential interviews it was determined the allegation of sexual abuse was substantiated. A staff member sexually abused a minor in care. This abuse is conduct inimical to the health, morals, welfare, or safety of clients in the home. The Department has determined that the enhanced civil penalty is warranted for the physical abuse of C1 while under the care and supervision of the STRTP. The violation does meet the definition of Physical Abuse per H&S 1548(e)(2) Physical Abuse to include Sexual Abuse as defined in Penal Code section 11165.1, which defines sexual abuse means sexual assault, AND Penal Codes section 11165.l(b)(l)-(2) describes sexual assault as including penetration, oral copulation, intrusion by one into the genitals of another, and intentional touching for purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty Law, Health & Safety Code section 1548(f)(1)(C) the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2500.00. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were provided.",

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced inspection visit to the administrative offices for Summitview Child and Family Services on 7/28/21 at 1: PM and met with Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs to discuss two incident reports. LPA informed Ms. Randle that the visit is related to an incident report involving C1 (see LIC811 dated 7/28/21). The 24 hour notification for the incident clearly states that youth had just returned from a psychiatric hold and had glass in their pocket which they refused to turn in to facility staff as part of the agreed upon safety plan prior to discharge from the psychiatric facility. This subsequently lead to youth being restrained for their own safety. In reading the full report received from the facility, the information is not consistent between the 24 hour report and the full report. The full report does not detail any information about glass but instead details a struggle over a \"plastic spoon\" which they were not allowed to have as part of the safety plan agreed upon when discharged from the psychiatric hospital. Youth attempted to leave the facility and became aggressive towards staff and was subsequently placed in a restraint. LPA informed Ms. Randle about the inconsistencies and did ask that the report be updated and resubmitted to ensure the accuracy between the 24 hour report(s) and the full reports. LPA also asked that the facility clearly define in the report the efforts that were made by the staff to de-escalate youth prior to engaging in the physical restraint as it is not evident in the way that the report is written. LPA also discussed another incident report involving C2 whereby C2 disclosed an incident that took place while on a home pass visiting family. The incident was reported to law enforcement in C2's home county and El Dorado County as C2 is currently living at the facility in this county. Agency reports that an attempt was made to report the incident to Child Protective Services as well but were informed that they could not take reports with \"unknown perpetrators\" and were informed that it was a law enforcement issue. Agency did inform placement agency of the disclosure. Exit interview conducted and document provided.",

The inspection on this date is for the purposes of relocation of one of the other facilities by the same licensee to this location. As such, all of the furnishings or other items were not present in the facility as would be expected for new licenses. LPA did observe some non perishable food items, chemicals used for cleaning and other furniture items in the facility but not all. During the inspection today, the following items were noted: This is a three story house with a large amount of storage space for clients and the facility staff. LPA observed a fire extinguisher near the kitchen area with an inspection tag dated 7/7/21. LPA discussed that this location will be doing schooling for youth as well as group therapies for clients admitted to the facility. LPA observed that there was adequate space for these services and more based on the size and make up of the home. LPA observed that there are two dual occupancy client bedrooms and two single occupancy client rooms in the facility that were all well stocked with dresser space, beds and night stands as required. There are no lamps but LPA did observe that each of these rooms had central lighting in the rooms. LPA observed that the screens for the windows in the client rooms were present. LPA observed two client bathrooms: the front bathroom was equipped with two sinks, toilet and tub and shower combination. There are a total of three full bathrooms and one half bathroom in the facility. Hot water was not available to be tested as there was a company installing a new HVAC system today which meant that they needed to disconnect the hot water lines. LPA observed that water delivery locations are receiving water and functioning and toilets were flushing. LPA was informed that shower doors were being replaced prior to accepting clients. The facility was observed to have viable exits from each level of the facility. LPA did advise that the facility ensure that the banister is safe and/or inspected as it was secure but seemed a bit loose near the stairs on the side of the house. LPA observed that the laundry facilities are in the garage as well as additional storage space facility supplies as needed. LPA observed an that the medication cabinet is located in the kitchen, near the refrigerator. The main entrance for visitors, staff and clients will near the driveway and garage area. LPA observed the cameras throughout the facility are still be installed. LPA did observe that the cameras are in the common areas only and on the exterior of the facility. The use of cameras shall not violate the personal rights of youth in care as they do not capture audio and are not used in client bedrooms or bathrooms. Fire clearance has not been received yet as facility needs to clear the exterior of the facility for defensible space as defined by fire marshal. LPA did observe that the exterior of the home did appear to have had a lot of the work done recently as some trees were cut down and stacked with ground cover ready to move. LPA was also informed that there is a great number of things pending at this time that the agency would like to do to the house prior to accepting clients, including painting of the interior of the home. The only obstacle that LPA observed at this time is the fire clearance. LPA did inform the agency that once the fire clearance is received then the license can be issued. LPA shall update the license information as this is not an accurate name for this facility at this time. LPA shall correct the document so that upon licensure, it is accurately reflected in the documents produced. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and document was provided via email.",

The purpose of the inspection on 3/25/22 was to discuss the following incident reports: 1/31/ AM incident - this report indicates that C1 was on a \"stop-run\" and subsequently restrained in the classroom, after leaving the relaxation room, and upon getting outside the building. LPA asked about the \"stop-run\"as leaving is part of youth's personal rights. The agency states that this is for the youth that are most at risk due to recent suicide attempts and other self harm behaviors and that these orders are evaluated frequently. LPA asked that the agency provide something in writing about the policy of these orders including how they are derived, how long they last, how frequently they are evaluated, and what input the youth have in making these decisions as they are to have a say in their needs and services and voices in their child and family team meetings. 1/31/ PM incident - this report indicates that C1 was set to leave the non-public school site at the end of the day and was asked to sit in the back of the vehicle due to previously exhibited behaviors but C1 refused. The reports indicates that there were four staff surrounding C1 as they stood by the van. C1 dropped their belongings and attempted to leave, running towards a busy roadway where they were subsequently restrained. LPA explained to the agency about how intimidating it appears on paper and that this must have felt pretty intimidating to C1, standing there surrounded by four staff. LPA further explained that the report does not indicate any verbal de-escalation techniques as they were all standing there or even some of the staff removing themselves from the immediate physical proximity to allow youth to build rapport or speak to youth about what was happening - all protocol for de-escalation. LPA did not issue citations on this date but did discuss additional training needs for staff regarding restraints, de-escalation techniques, and incident report writing.

Documentation received indicates that the facility was aware of the leak and possible contamination in July 2022, per the notation from ServPro that was provided on 3/20/23 by the facility. The notation clearly states that a moisture check was requested by Summitview (or a representative of the agency) as a result of a leak identified and that ServPro clearly found that the \"upstairs has drywall affected common wall to backside of shower\", vinyl flooring in the bathroom read moisture, and that the scope of the work indicated removal of the affected ceiling downstairs, removal of the vinyl and particle board flooring in the bathroom, removal of the baseboard and drill holes to dry the backside of the shower if no mold growth was found. Note states that the [customer] only wanted the moisture check and they would follow up for an estimate and services. Photos received indicate that the facility knew or should have known in November 2022 the leak issue was not resolved adequately as the photos show additional dark ceiling stains were present with new stains appearing daily and/or weekly. Photos received show spots on ceilings on the first floor as well as walls and floors on the second level of the facility and were taken from November 6, 2022 through February 10, 2023. Interviews with staff also indicate staff knew about the leak and thought that the agency was addressing the issue by shutting the facility down and making the necessary repairs in February 2023. As a result of the information obtained, documentation provided, and interviews conducted, the allegation that the facility has physical plant deficiencies that impact the health and safety of the clients is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The facility was cited for Title 22, Division 6, General Licensing Requirements Section 80087(a) Buildings and Grounds as the facility shall be clean, safe, sanitary and in good repair at all times for the safety and well-being of the clients, employees and visitors. The facility knew about a leak and possible mold issues in the facility prior to July 2022 but did not address the issues appropriately until February 2023. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documentation was provided along with appeal rights. indicating that overtime was mandatory but that the mandatory overtime didn't actually happen. The facility did indicate that they were having some staffing shortages but not to the point that they couldn't meet the Title 22 ratio requirements of three clients to one staff. When speaking with Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs, and Anna Gleason, Chief Executive Officer, it was discussed that the program statement reflects the ideal staffing levels for their short term residential therapeutic program at one staff to two clients but since the pandemic, finding qualified individuals to work has not been easy and they have not been able to maintain their desired staffing levels and have had to work with the one staff to three clients staffing ratio set by Title Regulations. As a result of the investigation and interview conducted, the allegation that the facility is understaffed is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that while the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documentation along with appeal rights was provided.",

Further, S1 does not have the same responsibilities as that of the administrators of the facilities even though the position titles are both \"Administrators\". While S1 never told individuals that S1 held an administrator certificate, there is some confusion due to the use of the term \"Administrator\" in the position title and the agency plans to rectify that in the coming weeks as there will be a leadership meeting related to staffing where these position titles, as well as many other topics, will be discussed at that time in an effort to alleviate the confusion as well as employee retention. S1 has worked for the agency well since prior to the transition to STRTP and thus remains qualified to work with the agency due to her tenure. The allegation related to client personal information being discussed in the presence of or disclosed to unauthorized individual(s) is related to individuals not directly involved in client care or treatment being present in or participating in meetings about client treatment services, child and family team meetings, or any other meetings that deal with client sensitive and confidential information or treatment. Staff interviewed talked about meetings being held in rooms where individuals not directly participating in the meeting being conducted were present or speaking up during these meetings. Confidential interviews revealed that youth were not consistently asked for their approval for the presence of these individuals in said meetings. As a result of the confidential interviews conducted and documentation reviewed, the findings of the complaint allegations that staff do not meet the minimum qualifications as required by licensing and staff are disclosing client personal information with unauthorized individual(s) are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the allegations occurred.

When interviewed, the therapist reported to the Investigator that staff could be heard in the background telling C1 to \"hurry up\" and when attempting to ascertain C1's location, staff were \"not being forthcoming with information\" and \"not wanting to give C1 the phone back\" to continue to the conversation. The agency's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) stated that they spoke with the parties on the phone and requested that the conversation be paused long enough to get C1 and the other youth back to their assigned house. CEO states that they were informed that the call could not be paused for convenience so the other youth were sent to their assigned house without C1. When CEO was asked if they heard any of the staff pushing C1 to hurry with their call, CEO states that they did not recall this but did say that they heard the other youth yelling these things as they were growing restless and hungry and wanting to return to their house. CEO states that law enforcement were summoned by the callers on the phone to the nonpublic school and did respond to the location to conduct a well check for C1. CEO states that law enforcement decided to transport C1 to the hospital for a mental health assessment. CEO states that C1 was returned to the facility the same day without further incident. As a result of the investigation conducted, the allegation that staff attempted to prevent C1 from making a complaint is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

LPA discussed the following incident reports while at the administrative office: 9/13/ C1's bags were searched when returning from Golden Plaza but there is no indication as to probable cause that would warrant a search of belongings. LPA advised that this may be seen as a violation of client rights as search does not seem to be warranted. 9/16/ C1's room was searched and medications were found in a gum container. LPA questioned the medications found, how they were obtained or prescribed to C1. LPA also cautioned that the agency needs to articulate the permission requested and/or obtained for rooms searches and what the probable cause was that prompted the search. 11/16/ C2 was identified as being on \"Safety Watch\" and it is indicated that there were to be daily room searches due to this Safety Watch. LPA advised the agency that this cannot be a blanket policy. CEO states that this has been removed and now the policies when on a Safety Watch are individualized, spelled out in Needs and Services Plans and signed off by parent/guardian or child welfare. 2/15/ C3 has a history of going after their medications when the medications were passed. LPA questioned change in the procedures following an incident that took place a few months prior to this about lunging for medications. In addition, C3 was able to get medications and ingest an excessive amount of medications. C3 was transported to the hospital for further evaluation and released the next day back to the facility. 3/18/ C4 was on a \"Heightened Supervision\" and room search was conducted. LPA advised that being on a heightened supervision is not probable cause to warrant search of their room. CEO states that this is a term used to ensure that staff are increasing supervision of the youth due to recent incidents to more than what they normally did with the youth. LPA again advised the agency of the policy to conduct rooms searches cannot be simply because the youth is on \"heightened supervision\". 4/18/ C5 was restrained after making remarks about self harm by running into traffic. LPA advised the agency that the report does not articulate any eminent danger to youth or other youth in the facility and thereby this use of restraint may be an unauthorized restraint. LPA requested that the agency provide documentation of advisement to all staff about the items discussed and CEO states that she continues to work with staff on writing of incident reports to ensure that they are clear and concise and meet expectations per the Licensing standards. Also discussed during the inspection on this date was the licensing fees that are all confused and not appropriated correctly. LPA did advise that the agency provide details about the fee assessments via email so that discussion can be held with the Department's Accounting Unit to appropriate the fees paid appropriately.

    "narrative": "While C2 did pursue C1 in the facility in an effort to get C1 to respond to C2, C1 did barricade themselves in the bathroom and C2 continued to bang on the door to gain access to C1. During another incident in the same month, C1 was on a phone call and had to enter the laundry room to get away from C2 that was again pursuing C1. Staff at the facility reported that while C1 was on their phone call, C2 almost broke the door by banging and kicking the laundry room door attempting to get at C1. During an interview with C2, they admitted to pursuing C1 stating that they were annoyed that C1 would not respond to C2 and would not talk to them. C2 denied banging on the door, bathroom or laundry room, even though this was reported by staff. The allegation that a minor physically abuses another minor is related to the same incident(s) where C1 was allegedly pursued by C2 and C2 physically assaulting C1. When LPA asked C2 about C2 allegedly hitting C1 with the phone one time, C2 states that it wasn't a big hit but more of a tap on the shoulder while C1 and C2 were passing one another in the facility hallway. C2 states that they believe that C1 did call law enforcement about that incident and they did respond but that nothing happened. C2 denied hitting C1 on any other occasion that they could recall. LPA did not interview C1 about this complaint as LPA was advised by C1's social worker that they did not want C1 interviewed due to C1's current placement being unstable at this time. As a result of the investigation conducted and information obtained and the inability to interview C1, the allegations that staff do not properly supervise minors, facility did not keep youth safe, and a minor physically abuses another minor is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documents, including appeal rights, were provided. Staff went on to disclose that as a result of not having consent forms allowing the facility to discuss C1 with this individual, the communication(s) were not returned nor was the communication forwarded to another individual within the agency that could speak to the individual. Staff also informed LPA that they did not have access or passwords to check the voice messages at the house at the time of the communications but have since obtained access to the voice messages but did not appropriately address the voices messages. As a result of the investigation and information obtained, the allegation that the facility did not return communications made to the facility is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The facility was cited for STRTP Interim Licensing Standards 87072(c)(4) Personal Rights. In addition to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16001.9, the facility shall ensure that each child is accorded personal rights including to have communications to the facility from relatives and/or authorized representative(s) answered promptly and completely. The facility did not return communications to an individual that they knew regularly spoke with C1 while in the facility nor did the facility engage anyone at the agency level return said communications as required by this regulation.

LPA Hill discussed incident reports with following incident reports with Danielle Bingle, administrator: * 8/10/ This report is related to C1 and C2 (see LIC811 dated 10/12/23) engaging in a behavior that may have been sexual between two youth but the report does not indicate that it was sexual in nature. Ms. Bingle states that it was reported by one of the youth as sexual. LPA Hill advised Ms. Bingle to put additional information in the reports to ensure that it is clear. * 8/1/ This report details an alleged sexual incident between C4 and C2 that was not consensual. LPA Hill advised the agency that this incident needs further investigation at this time. * 7/30/ This report is related to C3 (see LIC811 dated 10/12/23) speaking to individual(s) via phone of various ages. LPA Hill advised Alyson Chavez, Administrator, that this may not even be reportable unless there is some other inappropriate activity. * 7/25/ This report details that C4 engaged in property destruction by emptying out the refrigerator and breaking all contents of the containers. Ms. Chavez recalls that during this incident they ensured the safety of all the youth in the facility by having staff and clients to go another area until the area could be cleaned. * 7/22/ This report is related to C4 using C5's phone to order an Uber for an unauthorized absence. LPA Hill asked staff about observing C4 using C5's phone. Ms. Chavez recalls both youth were planning to leave but C5 was not fast enough to get to the vehicle and C4 left without waiting. Overall, LPA advised that the incident reporting is going well but did advise Ms. Chavez to provide additional information or explanation in the incident reports and particularly in the 24 hour reports. No citations were issued, exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to Ms. Randle.",

LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that the circumstances surround an unauthorized absence for C1 and C2 (see LIC811 dated 2/8/24) are currently being looked at. The incident included two youth absconding from the facility at approximately 1: AM on 2/7/24. The facility was acutely aware that both youth were planning to leave the facility days prior and had implemented an additional staff in the facility in case this should happen. When this did happen, there was additional staff present (S1) that followed youth as they left. Unfortunately, S1 lost sight of the youth. Youth were found on 2/7/24 around noon and transported to the hospital. LPA Hill discussed with Ms. Randle the reporting requirement related to the 24 hour notice. LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that while the Department appreciates the expeditious nature of the reporting by the agency, the agency should first pause to assess incidents that require 24 hour notification to ensure that accurate and thorough information is being provided. LPA Hill advised the agency to pause to get as much information as possible prior to sending the notification to Licensing. In this instance, the rush to get the notice to Licensing caused some confusion over additional information as it was trickling in. LPA Hill reminded Ms. Randle that it is more important to get accurate and thorough information rather than trying rush to get the 24 hour report to Licensing, possibly missing certain critical information. LPA Hill is looking further into this incident and shall return at a later date for additional interviews as necessary. LPA Hill did request the Needs and Services Plans for C1 and C2 and training for S1. End of document.",

Recent complaint investigation included review of documentation related to bed checks. The documentation obtained indicated that S1 did not conduct the required bed checks per the agency's policy. However, when interviewed, S1 indicated that the required bed checks were conducted despite the documentation indicating otherwise. S1 went on to sat that if the required bed checks had not been completed, S1's supervisor would have observed this via the video camera review and addressed it with S1 but this had not happened. LPA Hill reminded the facility that documentation is key to compliance and part of their Program Statement, in that their program statement indicates that they are to document the bed checks every 15 minutes. As such, LPA Hill issued a Technical Violation (TV) regarding the need to document bed checks per the agency's program statement. LPA Hill also discussed internal investigations with the agency as it pertains to their responsibility to investigate allegations or issues alleged by clients in care and take appropriate actions based on those allegation(s) to ensure the safety of all youth in care. Investigation indicates that during confidential interview(s), \"failed to thoroughly document and follow up with the status or completion of [an] internal review of the incident\". LPA Hill informed the agency that these report(s) if not investigated by Community Care Licensing via a complaint or case management inspection, is the responsibility of the agency to investigate and follow through with any/all appropriate actions to ensure the health, safety and personal rights of all clients in care. This advisory was also included on the Technical Violation (TV) indicated above as the agency's program statement indicates that they will investigate and/all allegation(s) and take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of all youth in care. Lastly, interviews conducted for a complaint investigation revealed some issues or potential violations observed. The first is related to the facility's obligation surrounding room compatibility. Per Interim Licensing Standards, Version 4, Buildings and Grounds, Section 87087(e), the licensee is required to document bedroom sharing arrangements ensures the health and safety of each child. In the case involving C1 and C2, investigation indicated that even after a reported disclosure of inappropriate touching between C1 and C2, the youth continued to be roommates for 11 weeks following the disclosure. This is a violation of the youths' rights to be in a safe and healthy environment. Facility was cited for violation of Personal Rights, 87072(c) including the right to live in a safe, healthy and comfortable home. Despite knowing that the youth were no longer compatible due to the allegation, the facility did not move the youth to another room or facility.

Investigation shows that C2 was inconsistent in their statements during interviews and follow up interviews conducted by the investigator. Despite C2 naming several staff and clients as witnesses, investigation failed to show any witnesses that could corroborate the alleged incident(s). In addition, S1 was specifically named as the awake night staff during the alleged incident(s) and when interviewed, S1 denied any knowledge or unreported incident(s) where youth were awake during the overnight shifts as reported. A review of the facility's documentation of the overnight shift did indicate that bed checks are required every 15 minutes but the documentation indicated inconsistent bed checks being conducted. Per the agency's policy, the bed checks are required to be conducted every 10 to 15 minutes. This not being conducted as indicated in the policy which would have left youth unsupervised for periods of time to include 30 to 45 minutes. When interviewed, S1 stated that while they did not document all room check(s) conducted, S1 was adamant that the room checks were completed per the agency policy and that camera review would indicate such but cameras were not available for review and/or reviewed. As a result of the investigation of the allegation that a lack of supervision resulted in a minor inappropriately touching another minor in care is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

When speaking with the therapist about this situation and C1's situation as a whole, therapist states that it is hard to depend on this for each type of hospitalization as each institution's policies and procedures could be different and/or preclude a policy such as this for discharges. LPA Hill obtained Needs and Services Plans for C1, along with C1's face sheet, Child & Family Team Meeting information, and other documentation relevant to C1's placement.

Mr. Navarrete signed documentation related to the inspection because Administrator Chavez needed to get to the residence. LPA Hill discussed the following incidents with Administrator Chavez: 7/2/24 - C1, C2 were escalated and C1 cause property damage and assaulted staff. Law enforcement was contacted and subsequent removed C1 for a mental health evaluation. C1 was able to commit to safety with the crisis worker and was returned to the facility. LPA Hill asked about an emergency CFT and citations/court date and was informed that while C1 was issued a citation, Administrator states that they do not feel that there will be a court date and feels that the charges will be dropped. Administrator states that they did a CFT following this incident and C1 was moved to another facility within the agency. No follow up is necessary and no citations were issued for this incident. 7/9/24 - C3 was not administered their PM medication on 7/8/24. Administrator states that there was a lot going on at the facility and it was an oversight of staff. Administrator states that they did counsel staff responsible and did provide a reminder to staff about the importance of the medication passing. No citations applicable and no further investigation needed. 7/13/24 - C4, C3, C5 were in one room together sleeping. C4 refused to listen to staff prompts to return to their own room for sleeping and fell asleep on the floor of the youths' room. Administrator states that staff were counseled about how to redirect youth. Administrator states that staff was provided additional training on how to properly deal with these situations. Administrator states C3 is no longer at the facility due to an unauthorized absence and C4 was relocated to another facility. C5 was a visiting youth and was only there for the weekend.

When youth left the facility on an authorized home visit, the staff did not provide the medications to the parent or guardian to ensure that medications were administered during the youth's home visit.

During this inspection, 3 out of Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of Direct Care Staff and 0 out of 4 youth were interviewed. (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, August 22nd, 2024). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Michelle Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

LPA Hill arrived and maintenance were at the home making repairs as a result of an incident that took place at the facility the night prior. LPA Hill alerted Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs of LPA's arrival and Ms. Randle came to the facility to assist in the inspection. LPAs Hill and Crass conducted a physical plant inspection of the facility inside and out and observed the following: There are five youth in the facility. LPAs observed that there are three dual occupancy rooms that are equipped with bedding, storage, dressers and closets. There are two client bathrooms that have hot water that meets requirements, water measuring at 116 degrees Fahrenheit, toilets flush and showers working. Paper towels and toilet paper are present in the bathrooms for client use. LPAs observed that while chemicals in the garage are locked and not accessible to youth, LPA advised that the facility lock chemicals in an additional locking cabinet for the safety of the youth that may accompany staff into the garage for any reason. The facility has operable smoke and a carbon monoxide detector in the hallway but it was not operating initially during the inspection. Maintenance was on site and batteries were replaced. It was operable by the end of the inspection. LPA observed that there is fence not attached during the physical plant inspection. LPA did advise that this needs to be attached as this is light enough to be picked up by youth and/or used as a weapon. LPA observed that all seatbelts were functioning, the vehicle had valid registration and proof of insurance in the vehicle and the vehicle started and runs. LPA observed that one of the screens was on the ground outside the window and advised that it be placed back in its place. Fire extinguisher was mounted on the wall near the kitchen and was last inspected on 7/30/24. While there are no youth at the facility at the time of the inspection, they are in school at another location at the time of the inspection. LPAs advised that they would be going to that location to conduct interviews with staff and clients. LPAs also advised that additional inspection will occur on another undisclosed date to include inspection of the youth and staff records. LPAs issued advisories for Outdoor Activity Space and Buildings and Grounds. Exit interview conducted and documents provided. End of inspection on this date.",

LPA Hill made this inspection to discuss the finalizing of an open case management inspection initiated on 8/23/24, regarding a youth allegedly finding a pill on the ground. LPA Hill interviewed staff supervising youth during the time that the alleged incident was to have happened and it was determined that it was not possible as staff was supervising youth and was with youth in crisis at the time of the alleged incident. Further discussion with Ms. Randle revealed that youth was supervised the entire time they were outside and in the house when this allegedly happened. LPA Hill was not able to interview youth in question as youth has been hospitalized since this incident and subsequently removed from the facility due to safety of the youths in the facility. This concludes the investigation related to this incident. LPA Hill also discussed the results of the annual inspection conducted 8/28/24. During interviews with youth and staff, LPA Hill was made aware that youth are not happy with the lunches provided in that they indicated that it's \"always a sandwich\" consisting of \"bagels and cream cheese\". LPA Hill advised Ms. Randle that when meals are provided by the facility, they need to have acceptable alternatives so that youth have a choice if they do not like or do not want what is prepared. Ms. Randle indicated that youth can request alternatives to the lunches provided. LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that this was not indicated in the interviews conducted with staff or youth in care. LPA Hill also discussed outings with Ms. Randle in that it was discussed that if youth do not want to attend a planned outing, they are given consequences, including a frozen program, which includes youth having to be in their room the duration of the outing but allowed out of their room for fifteen minutes of each hour. LPA Hill advised Ms. Randle that youth cannot be given consequences if they choose to not participate in outings. LPA Hill also discussed with Ms. Randle a denied exemption for S1. Ms. Randle indicated that the agency utilizes S1 for groups related to substance use and abuse. During the inspection, Anna Gleason, CEO, was contacted and indicated that it is their intent is to sponsor this individual in receiving an exemption with the Department. In the mean time, S1 was fingerprint cleared via \"Accurate\", which is utilized by the agency for fingerprinting services for staff employed by the agency for services other than in residence working with youth in care. Some of these services include their Wellness Team (therapists, family specialists, and other school based services), and Outpatient Support. The agency is contracted to provide mental health services to youth in the surrounding school districts. No citations were issued related to this issue. Exit interview was conducted and documentation was provided to Ms. Randle.",

Compatibility assessments also include discussion with each youth when they are admitted or if a youth needs to be switched rooms. Confidential interviews conducted revealed that these youth were in a previous placement prior to coming to this facility and were familiar with one another. When the opportunity presented itself for either of the youth to switch rooms, the youth refused to move rooms or to stop being roommates. The allegation that staff did not prevent minors from possessing restricted items is related to the agency policy prohibiting items containing alcohol to be in youths' possession and prohibiting that youth be in possession of items that youth could use to cause self harm, including sharp objects. The agency policy dictates youth must lock up these items with their hygiene items that contain alcohol. During the facility inspection, it was noted that C3 did have two bottles of perfumed body sprays in their restroom that were not locked according to this policy. Review of C3's Needs and Services Plan does not indicate that these items pose a danger to C3 and therefore C3 has a right to have these items in their possession. While the agency policy is to have these items locked, there is no regulation stating that youth cannot safely manage these items. Regarding having other dangerous items in youths' possessions including sharp objects, LPA Hill did not observe other dangerous items accessible to youth as reported. Confidential interviews indicated that sharp items are locked up and not accessible to youth in care. As a result of the investigation conducted including interviews conducted and documents reviewed, the allegations that staff did not ensure minors sharing a room were compatible and that staff did not prevent minors from possessing restricted items are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an announced inspection on 7/28/21 at 9: AM and met with Anna Gleason, CEO to tour the facility. The inspection on this date is for the purposes of relocation of one of the other facilities by the same licensee to this location. As such, all of the furnishings or other items were not present in the facility as would be expected for new licenses. LPA did observe some non perishable food items, chemicals used for cleaning and other furniture items in the facility. During the inspection today, the following items were noted: Kitchen had some of the required dishes, appliances and silverware for client use. LPA also observed that the kitchen has a locked storage cabinet where medications are to be stored. The kitchen had a covered trash can. There is an island with plenty of additional storage space for storage of other cooking supplies as needed. LPA did observe a missing drawer handle and was informed that maintenance is out attempting to obtain longer screws to fix this drawer. LPA observed a refrigerator and stove for cooking in the kitchen. LPA observed a fire extinguisher near the kitchen area with an inspection tag dated 7/7/21. LPA observed a closet near the front door of the facility that has a lock for storage of the cleaning supplies for this house. LPA observed that there are three dual occupancy client bedrooms in the facility that were all well stocked with dresser space, beds and night stands as required. There are no lamps but LPA did observe that each of these rooms had central lighting in the rooms. LPA observed that the screens for the windows and slider in the client rooms were present. LPA did not observe any missing screens on any of the windows. LPA observed two client bathrooms: the front bathroom was equipped with two sinks, toilet and tub and shower combination. LPA observed that there is hot water in the sinks and shower. There is an abundance of storage space in this bathroom. LPA did advise that the shelves in the vanity be removed/replaced as they are glass. Back bathroom was equipped with a shower, toilet and sink for client use. LPA observed that this bathroom also has adequate storage space. Back patio was observed to have two exits and the south exit was observed to have a broken stair. LPA was informed that the side with the broken step will be permanently blocked and stairs removed. Currently, that side of the patio is temporarily blocked by wood. LPA observed that the laundry facilities are off the kitchen as well as additional storage space for cleaning supplies and other toiletries such as toilet paper and paper towels. LPA observed that this room also housed the wifi equipment and DVR (cameras) system. LPA observed that the property has a locked well house (as the property functions off well water), a locked storage shed is located outside the converted garage area (not converted by the agency rather converted prior to purchase by sellers), LPA observed an additional dwelling located on the other side of the storage shed. The agency has not decided if that dwelling will be strictly storage or what the purpose of this building will be. Agency shall notify Licensing upon reaching a decision but shall maintain this dwelling locked and inaccessible by clients at all times. The main entrance for visitors, staff and clients will be the converted garage area and not the front entrance of the house as the entrance into the converted garage is closer to parking. This area shall also serve as storage for the facility and activities as necessary for the clients in care. LPA discussed the cameras observed throughout the facility and LPA did observe that the cameras are in the common areas only and on the exterior of the facility. The use of cameras shall not violate the personal rights of youth in care as they shall not capture audio and are not used in client bedrooms or bathrooms. LPA verified via email with fire inspector on 7/28/21 that the facility does have a fire clearance per their inspection. Inspector neglected to fax over the STD 850 to verify but agreed to do that first thing 7/29/21. LPA observed that the facility appears ready to receive clients and is recommending that the facility be licensed as of 7/28/21. Exit interview was conducted with Anna Gleason, CEO and document was provided via email.",

LPA informed Ms. Gleason that the incident involves two youth from this location, C1 and C2 (see LIC811 dated 11/12/21) where one client is alleging that an other client is being sexually inappropriate with them. LPA was able to interview C1 while at the agency during this visit. LPA could not speak with C2 as they were not present at the agency. LPA informed Ms. Gleason that additional investigation on this case management is needed and an additional visit will be necessary another day. LPA discussed with Anna Gleason another incident report including one from 9/23/21 where C3 refused to comply with medications and curfew and subsequently left the facility on an unauthorized absence following a statement about suicidal ideation. The report indicates that staff was not able to follow due to being the only staff in the facility at the time. LPA discussed the report with Anna Gleason in that it appears that C3 was struggling and had been struggling from the time that they were supposed to be sleeping until well after 12: AM and there was not an additional staff present to assist staff with client. LPA learned that behavior was common for this youth and was not alarming to staff until C3 left on the unauthorized absence. Anna Gleason states that the staff did respond quickly and C3 was returned to the facility but not articulated in the incident report. LPA reminded the agency that they need to have a full picture of the incident report and this should include the antecedent or what was happening prior to the incident, what happened during the incident as well as what happened after the incident. Anna Gleason states that she will send out a reminder to all staff of this. No citations were issued and exit interview was conducted. Document was provided to the agency.",

LPA toured the facility inside and out and found that the physical plant of the facility was in substantial compliance during the inspection. LPA observed that the house was equipped with three dual occupancy client bedrooms and two bathrooms accessible to clients in care. All bedrooms were fully equipped with appropriate bedding and furnishings as required. The bathrooms were properly equipped with appropriate supplies and LPA did not find anything in that bathrooms that should not otherwise be accessible to clients. LPA observed that the smoke detectors were functioning as required and that there is a carbon monoxide detector in the home. LPA did advise that the carbon monoxide detector be moved to be closer to client bedrooms rather than be in the living room of the facility. LPA observed that there was adequate food, perishable and nonperishable, in the facility for the clients in care. LPA observed that the facility looked clean and tidy during the inspection. All clients were at their school program during the inspection. LPA observed that the exterior of the home is well taken care of and that there is adequate room for clients to do activities outside. LPA advised that the couple of branches observed in the yard be removed so as to not present a trip hazard to clients. LPA also advised that the additional building needs to have access during the annual inspection that will be happening in July or prior to. LPA looked inside of the additional buildings on the property through the windows and it is obvious that nobody is living in the building and it is empty. LPA also looked inside the shed in the driveway and LPA observed that there are a couple of ladders in there and that there was nothing else of substance. LPA returned to the administrative buildings to review staff and client files on this date but there was not enough time to complete all of the review. LPA informed the agency that an additional visit will need to be conducted to interview client and staff and to review documents. LPA obtained client copies of files during the visit and will complete documentation related to client and staff files at a later visit. LPA will review staff files at a later visit with the agency as well. LPA did not observed any violations during the visit and an exit interview was conducted with Anna Gleason, Agency Administrator.",

The purpose of the inspection on 3/25/22 was to discuss the following incident reports related to the facility: 2/20/22 - C1 experienced an episode in the bathroom lasting 2.5 hours and staff informed C1 that they were calling emergency services for an evaluation and youth acknowledged that it might be best for them. The report does not indicate that they were called. LPA informed Ms. Gleason that there is a lot missing from this report and not a clear picture of what happened or why they did not call emergency services or if they did. LPA asked that the agency rewrite the report with a clear picture of what transpired and resubmit it to LPA. 12/9/21 - C1 was restrained for trying to go AWOL. Youth was pulled back into the facility through an open window. LPA explained to the agency that restraints are not allowed strictly for attempts to AWOL. LPA provided that the agency needs to constantly evaluate situations such as these as the youth have a right to leave the facility as part of their Personal Rights. 12/1/21 - C2 was on a \"Safety Watch\" as indicated in the incident report but there is no information as to why. LPA explained that a youth being on a safety watch does not automatically mean that they do room searches or any other action that violates a youth's personal rights. LPA did not issue citations on this date but did discuss additional training needs for staff regarding room searches, restraining of youth, safety watches, and incident report writing. LPA did provide that when physical intervening a youth that is attempting to leave the facility, this requires additional documentation to accompany the incident report. LPA is aware that the agency is undergoing some major changes that would include a change in facility type and understands the struggles regarding staffing. Exit interview was conducted and document was provided to Ms. Gleason.",

LPA interviewed C1 and one staff person present for the incident. LPA explained to Ms. Randle that the incident report needed to indicate additional information since the report is not clear about why youth are not given access to wifi in the resident, who called law enforcement, why youth was transported to a local cafe by law enforcement, and how long youth was at the cafe. LPA discussed with staff at the facility other information that is necessary to be in the incident reports (particularly the 24 hour reports) when submitting the reports to Licensing. LPA also discussed with the staff that it has been observed that there is an up-tick in medication incident reports where medications are either not administered or incorrectly administered for doses or medications. LPA advised that the agency needs to do something to ensure that youth are given their medications as prescribed and that missing medications for youth is not acceptable. LPA discussed 24 hour reports with the agency as well. LPA pointed out that there are incidents in which there is little to no information about why a youth is restrained or information is missing that is vital to know on these reports. LPA provided examples of the 24 hour incident reports that need additional information on them so that staff are aware of the missing or incomplete reports.

    "narrative": "not communicating with authorized representative about incidents that lead to C1 missing appointment(s) until C1 was discharged from the facility. When interviewed, the authorized representative stated that the communication received was after C1 had already left the facility and that it was that C1 had an orthodontic appointment that had to be rescheduled twice due to behaviors. Authorized representative states that they had conducted two Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings while C1 was in the facility but that this was never brought up or discussed during those meetings. Authorized representative states that had this information been shared prior to discharge, the authorized representative could have made additional visits to the facility to assist in the transport to the necessary appointment(s) or stabilization of C1's placement prior to C1 being displaced. When LPA Hill interviewed agency staff, LPA Hill learned that there is no specific documentation or policy related to appointments made or cancelled for clients. Since this complaint investigation, they have now implemented procedures for documenting appointments made, reasons for cancellation when necessary, and notifications to placing agencies. As a result of the investigation, documents obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff did not communicate with minor's responsible party [about the missed appointments] is SUBSTANTIATED meaning that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. Facility was cited for violation of Reporting Requirements, 80061(f) as the facility is required to make report(s) to the client's authorized representative of incidents, including but not limited to any unusual incident which threatens the physical or emotional health or safety of any client. LPA Hill observed that the facility did not provide C1's authorized representative information including the need to cancel medical, dental, and vision appointments as a result of behaviors. Exit interview conducted and documentation provided. requirement that the facility obtain a written medical assessment of clients admitted \"prior to or within 30 calendar days following [their] acceptance\". Complaint also alleges that C1 was not taken or provided access to dental or vision services. When reviewing the documentation related to C1, there is documentation that a physical was completed, by the placing agency, the week prior to placement. Related to dental services, it is documented that C1 had two appointments for orthodontia care but those appointments were cancelled due to unsafe behaviors. There is no documentation related to vision services being provided but the regulations do not speak to time frames for this to be conducted and C1 was in the facility for a month. As a result of the investigation, documents received, and interviews conducted the allegation that the facility did not ensure that C1 attended scheduled appointments is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

The facility was proactive in removing all bedding and washed all clients' bedding in hot water and dried on high heat as well as contacting an outside pest control company, Terminax, to come out to the facility for possible treatment. Terminax professional determined that there was no evidence of bed bug infestation in the home but did place traps around the bedding to ensure this. * 8/15/23 - Facility reported that C1 (see LIC811 dated 10/6/23) was struggling as a result of a substance dependency and the facility utilized a harm reduction approach to keep C1 from leaving the facility. LPA Hill advised that the facility maintain written documentation in the client's file, i.e. documentation of acknowledgement from the county social worker. * 8/13/23 and 8/3/23 - Facility provided a report that details C2 being inappropriate in their use of their cell phone in the facility, i.e. taking inappropriate pictures. LPA Hill discussed cell phone appropriateness, education, and usage with facility staff. LPA Hill also discussed another report with the facility that appeared to give C2 more than one consequence for the same violation. LPA Hill cautioned staff about this. * 6/24/23 - Facility provided a report about C3 regularly not sleeping in their own room. Continued on LIC809C * 4/8/23 - Facility provided a report about multiple youth in the facility, (C2, C4, C5) engaging in an inappropriate manner at the facility, including being able to obtain dangerous items and threatening staff with these items. LPA Hill asked the facility about contacting law enforcement. LPA Hill advised that once youth in the facility are able to obtain sharp items and threatening to staff or youth, they should call. LPA Hill also discussed some medication issues reported to Licensing and Ms. Magelietta states that she has worked with the facility staff about putting reminders on, in particular for the mid day medication reminder to ensure that youth are no longer missing medications. LPA Hill did not cite the facility for any of the incident reports discussed as the facility followed protocol and did what was supposed to be done in each of the incidents. Exit interview conducted with Ms. Randle and documentation was provided on 10/6/23.",

    "narrative": "LPA Hill interviewed three youth and the administrator about the air conditioning unit being in disrepair and the comfortable environment for the youth. During interviews, it was indicated that the facility did contact an outside vendor to service the unit once it was noted on 8/9/23 that it was not functioning. The vendor came to the facility on 8/14/23 and 8/15/23, repairing it, but it stopped functioning again within 48 hours. The same vendor was asked to return to the facility on 8/17/23 and determined that a part needed to be replaced, but that it would take a few days for the part to come in. Final repair of the air condition unit was conducted on 8/22/23. During the time that the air conditioning unit was not functioning properly, the agency did supply the facility with an industrial-sized swamp cooler and fans for the youths' rooms to use during this time. The youth were offered to relocate to the administrative offices during this time but declined this option as they preferred to be in the facility where their bed and belongings were at. In addition, the agency provided LPA Hill with an invoice indicating annual maintenance with the same vendor dated July 13, 2022. Interviews conducted with staff and youth, indicated that while it was hot with the air conditioning unit not functioning, the agency did accommodate youth as best as possible by providing fans and an industrial-sized portable air conditioning unit in the facility until the necessary repairs could be completed. In addition, the agency offered to relocate youth temporarily to the administrative offices until the unit could be repaired but the youth opted to stay in the facility instead. As a result of the information obtained, documentation provided, and interviews conducted, the allegation that the facility air conditioning unit is in disrepair and that staff are not providing a comfortable environment for minors is UNSUBSTANTIATED meaning the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred as the agency made attempts to get a vendor to the facility for repair of the air conditioning unit and did attempt to make youth more comfortable by relocating youth to the agency's administrative offices while waiting for the unit to be repaired.

    "narrative": "Investigation showed that maintenance was alerted to a possible incontinent issue in one of the facilities with youths beds prompting an agency-wide inspection which included all facilities operated by the Summitview Child & Family Agency. As a result of this inspection, mattresses were replaced if they were identified as soiled, stained, or showing signs of wear. It was alleged that one of the youth had removed the mattress cover after having an accident without telling staff so a new cover was not placed on the bed to prevent the soiling of the mattress. Staff interviewed indicated that the agency did an inspection of all the facility beds throughout the agency and replaced multiple mattresses throughout their facilities including the youth(s) who were identified as having incontinence issues. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, the allegation that youth was not provided with a mattress in good condition is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The facility was cited for Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program, Interim Licensing Standards Section 87088(c)(1) Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment, and Supplies as the licensee is to provide and make readily available to each child an individual bed maintained in good repair; equipped with good springs and a clean mattress and investigation showed that one or more youth had been sleeping on a mattress that was soiled or mattresses that were identified as soiled or in need of being replaced as they did not meet this standard. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documentation, including personal rights were provided. odor present as a result of the youths' incontinent issues, staff were cleaning the youths' rooms, doing the youths' laundry daily, and working with both youths on this issue in private so as to rid the facility of the smell. Interviews indicated that while it was difficult due to youths' behaviors of hiding clothes or not wanting to tell staff when there was an issue when youths' first arrived at the facility, staff tried. None of the staff and clients interviewed felt that staff were neglectful or dismissive of the issue and did take the youths' health and cleanliness issues seriously. As a result of this, while there was a smell that lasted in the house for about a month, the staff were working with youths in care to overcome the issues for a clean and safe environment for all in the facility. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, the allegations that licensee did not properly address minor's incontinence needs and did not ensure that the facility was kept odor free are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. The allegation that a youth is engaging in a relationship with an adult is related to a youth talking with an adult male while at the facility via a tablet furnished by Summitview Child and Family Services. During interviews, when it was discovered that youth was initiating conversations with this adult male. Subsequently, the tablet was removed and cleaned by the agency's technology department followed by firewalls being installed to prevent further contact with this individual. While the agency cannot prohibit calls due to youth's personal rights, the agency did discuss this further during youth's Child and Family Team meetings and is no longer a concern. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted, the allegation that youth is engaging in a relationship with an adult is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "medical condition. Some of the recommendations on the documentation include the need to make lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet, an avoidance of processed foods and foods high in refined sugars and carbohydrates, and regular exercise. In addition, the paperwork indicates that the doctor recommended allowing youth to work with staff in selecting food choices for the shopping list and \"snack box\" at the facility that were conducive to youth's medical diagnosis. When interviewed, C1 indicated that initially the facility did not cater to C1's medical condition and options for snacks in the facility included inappropriate choices such as crackers and cups of noodles. C1 indicated that when C1's medical condition escalated and became emergent, then the facility began to work with youth on food choices, but this did not happen until C1 was about to leave and go home. Interviews conducted indicated that when the doctor provided suggestions on eating and logging food intake, they worked with youth to ensure doctor-recommended snack options were available and that food alternatives were offered including wheat bread versus white bread, wheat pasta versus bleached pasta, etc. LPA Hill requested copies of the menus for the facility from August 2023 to December 2023, that do not indicate alternatives as suggested or required by the doctor. The menu shows many food items specifically listed on the food avoidances list provided by the doctor. While substitutions may have been provided, there is no evidence that this happened as the menus provided do not indicate substitutes for items such as pancakes, sliders, sugary cereals, toast, rice, spaghetti, hamburgers (buns), baked potatoes, etc. to name a few. As a result of the information and documentation received, the allegation that the facility did not follow the doctor's orders is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The facility was cited per Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87076(d) Food Services as food served shall meet special dietary needs...as recommended by a physician. The allegation that the facility leaves sharp objects accessible to clients in care is related to an incident where C1 had access to sharp objects and being able to access these sharp items without staff knowledge. LPA Hill observed an incident on or about 10/4/23, facility staff did not lock a staff drawer containing sharp items, including scissors, resulting in C1 accessing the drawer and getting some scissors without staff knowing. C1 then took the scissors into the bathroom during their shower time and cut their own hair without staff knowledge and without parental permission. While interviews indicated that the drawer was to remain locked, it was indicated that youth knew when staff neglected to lock the drawer as required. As a result of the information and documentation received, the allegation that the facility left sharp objects accessible to clients in care is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The facility was cited per General Licensing Standards, Title Regulations, Section 80087(g)(1) Buildings and Grounds as dangerous items were not locked as required. The allegation that the facility is not conducting child and family team meetings (CFTs) as required is related to C1 not having the CFTs every 30 days as required by regulation. The reporting party states that while in care, the facility failed to conduct the required monthly Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings for this facility type of facility. During the investigation into these allegations, LPA Hill learned that C1 was initially placed into a different facility type with the same agency in April 2023. The licensee was informed that C1 required a Short Term Therapeutic Residential Program (STRTP) where the expectations and requirements were different. C1 was placed in the STRTP on 8/24/23, and a documented CFT meeting was conducted on 11/8/23. C1 was discharged from the facility 12/21/23. During this time, only one documented CFT was conducted, and no Needs and Services Plan was obtained for C1 from 8/24/23 to 12/21/23. As a result of the information and documentation received, the allegation that the facility is not conducting child and family team meetings (CFTs) as required is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. While regulations do not require a CFT every thirty days, the Needs and Services Plan are required to be updated every 30 days and shall consider recommendations of the child and family team, eluding to the requirement to have CFTs every 30 days. The facility was cited per the Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87068.3(b)(2) Modifications to the Needs and Services Plan. The allegation that the facility did not assist with discharge and aftercare services planning as required is related to C1 being discharged back to the care of their family with no aftercare services in place and no plan to continue to see youth until youth could get established with another provider for mental health services. The reporting party states that because C1 is a post adoption youth, they were informed that it was the family's responsibility to coordinate and look for services for C1 for ongoing mental health services after leaving placement because they lived so far away from the placement agency. When questioned, LPA Hill was informed that the therapist is responsible for postdischarge services for youth leaving care. When asked for proof of aftercare services coordination for C1, LPA Hill was informed that there were no aftercare services provided or coordinated for C1. Additional documentation provided shows there was a lack of communication with the Health Services Department within Summitview \"on several things related to [C1's] health\". As a result of the information and documentation received, the allegation that the facility did not assist with discharge and aftercare services planning as required is SUBSTANTIATED meaning the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. The facility was cited per the Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87089.1(d)(3) Mental Health as the facility shall ensure continuity of care, services, and treatment as a child moves from their short-term residential therapeutic program placement to home-based family care for at least six months postdischarge from a short-term residential therapeutic program. In this case, C1 went home without the required array of services as required. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle and documentation was provided including appeal rights. indicated that they have asked for additional training related to good choices and getting C1 engaged in making healthy choices. C1 tends to refuse these services. Food shoppers were given healthy alternatives to purchase to have on hand for the house but cannot force youth to make those healthy choices. Regarding the allegation that the facility is threatening C1 with discharge is related to C1 needing to go to the emergency room due to their health condition and the facility informing the reporting party that if C1 were to go and be formally diagnosed with a medical condition that they could not handle or may not be able to accommodate, C1 would be discharged from the program. In speaking with the staff that regularly interacted with the reporting party and Chief Executive Officer, it was denied that C1 was ever threatened with discharge from the facility for diagnosis of this medical condition. The allegation that facility staff were discussing employment and/or discipline topics with youth in care is related to staff complaining about specific aspects of their employment with youth in care or where youth could hear these discussions. Staff were discussing topics such as not being paid enough to deal with youth, that staff are leaving their jobs to find employment that pays more, or being written up for things that youth do, and other personnel issues around youth in care. LPA Hill obtained proof of the facility's knowledge that at least one staff member was doing this via an email dated 10/19/23 to that staff person identifying that this is an issue when youth are present. In addition, there were multiple notices for staff about discussions in front of youth in care including 3/30/22, 8/17/23, 11/9/23 and 1/31/24. While this was happening at the agency, it was addressed, staff were counseled/reminded that this is not an acceptable practice. LPA Hill did not find additional personnel speaking about personnel issues around youth in care following the email reminder to not discuss personnel issues or other inappropriate topics in the facility. The allegation that staff did not appropriately intervene in adult/child interactions is related to an interaction that C1 had with outside medical personnel during a routine medical appointment. It was alleged that C1 reported that the interaction was a \"deep conversation\" with the medical personnel individual and may have been inappropriate as it was related to what drugs do to the brain. When interviewed, staff indicated that they would not always stop those conversations as youth benefit from hearing the same message from multiple individuals, not just the facility staff. Staff indicated that these messages go further when heard from multiple different sources. When interviewed, C1 indicated that staff accompanied C1 during the entire time of the appointments. During interviews, staff indicated that they would not intervene unless youth are having inappropriate conversations about the benefits of illicit drug use or how to obtain or use drugs. Staff indicated that the transport never reported an inappropriate conversation during a medical appointment, indicating that staff did not feel any conversations had been inappropriate. As a result of the investigation, interviews conducted, and documentation reviewed, the allegations that the facility did not meet the need of C1 as it relates to C1's health condition, the facility threatened to discharge C1, facility staff discussed employment and/or discipline topics with youth in care and facility staff did not appropriately intervene in adult/child interactions are all UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Tamara Hill made an unannounced case management inspection on 4/11/24 at 2: PM and met with Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs. LPA Hill made this case management inspection to discuss the conclusion of an investigation related to an incident report related to C1's return to the facility from a home visit on 4/1/24 and C1 not being given their morning medications upon return. C1 had gone with family for the weekend and when C1 was returned, C1 arrived at the agency's non-public school site, Monday morning, 4/1/24. C1's regularly scheduled medications are to be administered at 8:00 but C1 arrived at the non-public school site after 9:00 am. While the school site staff assumed that the parent/guardian had already given the youth their medication, nobody specifically asked C1 or their parent/guardian which resulted in C1 missing morning medications. LPA Hill discussed this incident with Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs and did interview the facility administrator and school aid supervisor about C1's arrival at the non-public school site. LPA Hill observed that the agency's policies and procedures are not clear about receiving youth at the non-public school site, who or how youth are to be checked in at the school site, or how to ensure that youth are given their medication(s) upon return. After reviewing the medication transfer documentation, LPA Hill did advise the agency to add some details to this medication transfer documentation to indicate when youth are being given medication by the parent/guardian during their home pass. This documentation would be similar to what the facility is required to do, i.e., date, time and signature of parent/guardian who administers the medication. In addition, LPA Hill advised that on the medication transfer sheet there be a note informing the parent/guardian of the responsibility to administer the medications if they are returning the child after any regularly scheduled medication time. As a result of the interviews conducted and documentation received and reviewed, LPA Hill did not issue any citations during the inspection and investigation related to this incident but did issue a Technical Advisory related to the medication transfer procedure(s) on the attached LIC9102TA. While at the agency on this date, LPA Hill also spoke to the agency regarding another incident involving C1 in which C1 was not administered a prescribed medication on 4/3/24. LPA Hill learned from Ms. Randle that overnight staff are to pack any medications that are to be administered while at the non-public school site for youth but on 4/3/24, this particular medication, being that there had been a change in the administration, was not packed accordingly. While the incident report received indicates that staff responsible, S1 and S2, were counseled and training was to be provided 4/8/24, LPA Hill learned S2, S3, and S4 were all responsible but only S1 was provided the required training. As a result of this, LPA Hill did cite the agency for violation of Interim Licensing Standards, Section 80075(b) h LPA Hill conducted an exit interview related to this incident and provided documentation to Ms. Randle.",

LPA Hill made the inspection today to discuss the facility's protocol related to medication training for parent(s)/guardian(s) to ensure the health and safety of youth while away from the facility. LPA Hill interviewed C1's therapist who communicated that they were aware of the incident and stated that, due to the seriousness of the incident, was going to go over medication security with the parent(s) this Friday. C1 is not scheduled to go on a home pass this weekend and the therapist states that in addition to them doing education training for the parent(s), they will ensure that Medical Services also reviews the filling out of the form and medication security while C1 is in the home. LPA Hill also spoke with Anna Gleason, CEO about the safety and security of youth in care and with Haley Randle, Director of Youth Residential Programs, about the education of the parent(s) about the medication and medication security. Both state that they will ensure that the facility administrator educates parent(s) about the potential dangers related to youth having access to the medications and the need to have documentation related to refusals as that needs to be discussed with the psychologist as needed.

    "narrative": "When arriving at the nonpublic site, S1 and C1 got into S1's vehicle and C1 observed S1's vaping device in the vehicle. S1 admits that the vaping device was in plain sight in the vehicle but that they put the device away immediately upon getting into the vehicle but that C1 had already seen it. Confidential interviews indicate conflicting statements as to whether or not S1 allowed C1 to use their vaping device during the transport. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff allowed a youth to smoke in staff's personal vehicle is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that staff disclosed personal information to youth is related to an alleged disclosure that S1 shared personal information about themselves to C1 that may have been inappropriate or triggering to youth in care. When interviewed, C1 disclosed that S1 shared a traumatic event that had happened to themselves and that this information and/or disclosure was triggering to C1 due to their own trauma. During an interview with S1, they denied that they shared more than peripheral information about themselves in an effort to demonstrate to youth that it is possible to overcome their circumstances. S1 denied sharing any traumatic information about themselves as they understand that personal stories can be triggering to youth in care and can take the focus off of youth in care. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff disclosed personal information to youth is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that staff spoke inappropriately to youth is related to a disclosure made by C1 that S1 spoke to C1 about a romantic text between S1 and S2. During confidential interviews, both staff denied any romantic interest and/or text messages between themselves. C1 refused interview with LPA Hill and would not elaborate on any information to assist in the investigation. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff spoke inappropriately to youth is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

LPA Hill made the inspection to discuss an incident report related to an incident report dated 4/23/24 indicating that C1 (see LIC811 dated 4/30/24) had missed their midday prescribed medication. Upon arrival at the administrative site for Summitview Child & Family Services to discuss the issue, LPA Hill met with Alyssa Polk, Special Ed Learning Coach Supervisor who supervises the educational staff. Ms. Polk discussed that last week was a bit of a different scheduled for C1 due to state testing which required C1 to arrive at the administrative site later than normal, causing the missed medication dosage as the required staff were no longer present to administer the medication to C1. When discussing the issue, Ms. Polk indicated that it came to their attention that C1 did not have a refill for this same medication and had missed their medication. Upon further review, it was determined that C1 missed their medications the evening of 4/29/24 and the morning 4/30/24. While the facility has already ordered the medication and it will arrive today, C1 still missed the medication 4/23/24, 4/29/24, and 4/30/24. When asked who is responsible for ordering refills, Ms. Polk states that it is the administrator and while the house administrator was on vacation last week, this did not conflict with or should not have impeded the responsibility to refill the medication. As a result of the information discussed, LPA Hill informed Ms. Randle that due to the repeated missed medications, the facility was cited for Title 22, Division 6, General Regulations, Health Related Services, Section 80075(b). The facility is required to assist clients with self-administration of prescription and nonprescription medications. This did not happen as evidenced by the medication errors 4/23/24, 4/29/24, and 4/30/24. This is a repeat violation within the previous 12 months, resulting in a civil penalty today.

LPA Hill made the inspection to discuss an incident dated 5/3/24 where C1 (see LIC811 dated 5/16/24) disclosed self-harm and showed staff the marks \"up and down both right and left legs\". C1 was engaged on the phone with a crisis hotline and medical services were summoned to the facility. Ms. Randle states that a room search was conducted after C1 informed staff that they had \"gotten rid of\" the object they were using to self-harm. Ms. Randle states that the staff in the facility informed C1's social worker that the room search was being completed while C1 was at the hospital. Upon discharge, the agency picked C1 up at the hospital and they were informed that they found \"multiple\" items hidden in C1's hair that could be used for self-harm and these items were removed by hospital staff. Ms. Randle states that following this information, C1's therapist contacted C1's social worker to request a change in C1's Needs and Services Plan to include wanding C1 when returning from school or is otherwise outside of the facility's supervision. LPA Hill questioned Ms. Randle about the supervision of C1 as indicated in the incident report that the staff that encountered C1 was passing by C1's room to check on another client in care. In review of the cameras in the facility, it was observed that while there were three staff present at the facility, two of the staff were observed to be sitting at the kitchen table for approximately 20 minutes and one staff was in the living room supervising two youth. LPA Hill observed that C1 was not supervised for approximately 30 minutes and no staff were engaging with C1 during this time. The facility was cited for Title 22, Division Six, General Licensing Standards, Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision, Section 80078(a) as the facility is required to provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. The facility was not supervising C1 which resulted in C1 engaging in self harm without staff knowledge. Citation was issued and documentation was provided to Ms. Randle.",

    "narrative": "in an effort to combat the pests, the facility staff and clients were also advised to wash all of the clothing, bedding, and maintain a clean the facility. While the facility did all of this, the bed bug issue persisted and the youth in the facility continued to complain about bed bug bites. Documentation shows that the facility became aware of the bed bug issues in the facility on 4/1/24 and began treatments including spraying the facility, washing youths' clothes, stripping of the beds and laundering of the clothing and bedding for the youth. Based on interviews with staff and clients, staff attempted to launder youths' clothing and bedding and this proved unsuccessful and the pests persisted. As of 4/12/24, the facility maintenance, in consultation with a local pest control, attempted to rid the facility of the pests by spraying the interior of the house with chemicals on a weekly basis as advised by the local pest control and advising all staff to pack up youths' belongings, including soft items, into bins once laundered but this did not resolve the issue. As of 5/6/24, documentation obtained from the facility indicates that the initial treatments were not successful and the agency hired a local pest control, Hangtown Pest Control, to conduct a more thorough treatment, including \"three treatments over three weeks\". This treatment required all clothing items to be washed and dried on hot settings and other items to be placed in large containers and stored until the treatment was complete. Beds were to be stripped daily and the rooms deep cleaned for the three weeks and all personal items could not be returned to the youths' bedrooms for the three weeks. The agency knew about the bed bug issue in the facility and attempted to address the issue in-house in April 2024 but they were not successful at combating this issue until hiring a professional pest control in May 2024 to render the services necessary, prolonging the treatment and presences of the pests in the facility. While the facility did not sit idle and ignore the pest issue, they did prolong treatment by attempting to address the pests in-house and not using a professional service as needed. As a result of this, the allegation that the facility did not address pests is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

    "narrative": "This complaint investigation named S1 in addition to S2, S3, and S4 as providing vaping devices, including tobacco and marijuana, to youth in care. S1 was interviewed for the previous complaint investigation and S1 denied ever providing a vaping device to a youth in care. S1 made statements eluding to the agency not paying them enough to purchase vaping devices to give to youth in care. S1 did acknowledge that one youth (not connected to this investigation) saw their personal vaping device in their car during a transport one time and requested to \"hit it\" but S1 denied allowing youth to use the vape. S2, S3, and S4 were all interviewed and all staff denied supplying vaping devices to youth in care. S1 did not continue to work for the agency following the previous investigation due to reasons not solely related to the allegation. Law enforcement interviewed C1 and this is where additional staff were named (S2, S3, S4) and that disclosure indicated that they directly provided vapes, had direct knowledge about the vapes and who was supplying them, or were in collaboration with staff providing vapes to youth in care. C1 also disclosed that C4, and C2 and C3 (who do not live at this facility) all knew about the vapes and knew the staff named were providing vapes to youth in the agency. Following the complaint allegation, C1 did not return to the facility. When interviewed, S2, S3, and S4 all denied ever providing vaping devices to youth in care and denied knowing that youth were getting vaping devices from any staff working for the agency. Staff indicated that they thought youth were bringing in vapes when returning from home passes, from youth who attended public schools in the area, or when the youth residing in the facility interact with outside youth that come to the agency for therapy and groups in the afternoons. Staff stated that they thought the vapes were brought in by youth and subsequently passed to other youth in the agency and through the different facilities as this is what youth indicated when vaping devices were recovered. C2 and C3 were interviewed on 6/27/24 and neither could confirm that they paid staff or requested that staff provide vapes or that they saw a transaction of this nature. Both youth stated that they only heard rumors about this happening but had no direct proof or knowledge and no staff ever confirmed this directly to either youth. Both youth talked about S1 taking money from youth for snacks and bringing back snacks to youth but neither disclosed any information about S1 or any other staff providing vapes. C4 was interviewed in conjunction with the previous complaint investigation and they too denied knowing about, receiving, or seeing any staff provide vapes to youth in care. All youth confirmed that they heard about S1 providing vapes via rumors throughout the agency but none indicated that they had any proof. The allegation that staff threatened minors in care is related to the providing of the vapes and alleges that S1 threatened to get youth kicked out of the program if they told administrative staff or anyone about S1 providing the vaping devices. The interview conducted by law enforcement indicates that C1 denied being threatened by staff about the vaping devices but a subsequent interview of C1 conducted by C1's social worker indicated that C1 revealed they felt threatened and did not want to return to the agency as they felt that they would be retaliated upon or that C1 would be targeted as a snitch for making the report. No other youth confirmed any threats as they denied being involved with or receiving vaping devices. As a result of the interviews conducted and investigation completed the allegations that staff is providing smoke contraband to minors in care and that staff threatened minors in care are UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Gleason and documentation was provided.",

    "narrative": "The allegation that staff were providing vaping devices to minors in care is related to an allegation that S1 and S2 were providing vaping devices, including tobacco and marijuana, to youth in care. Confidential interviews conducted by the Sheriff's Office alleged that S1 was providing vapes to youth in care without it being asked of S1 or the youth directly requesting them. It was also alleged that S1 never requested youth to pay for the vaping devices or that any money was exchanged for the purchase of the vaping devices. A vaping device was turned in to LPA Hill during an interview that youth alleged came from S1. This vaping device was given to Director of Youth Residential Programs by LPA Hill immediately following the interview. At the time of this disclosure, S1 had recently been discharged from their employment with the agency due to this being the second allegation involving vaping devices and other reasons, not related. A previous investigation and interview with C5 alleged that S1 allowed C5 to use S1's vaping device during a transport in S1's personal vehicle but S1 denied that this happened. S1 stated that the vaping device was in plain sight in their vehicle initially and that when C5 remarked about the vaping device, S1 removed the vaping device from sight and did not allow C5 to use it. This allegation was not substantiated. One youth originally alleged that S1 and S2 were providing vaping devices to youth in care but when interviewed by this LPA, that same youth denied any knowledge about staff providing vaping devices to youth. Youth stated that they heard one time a youth say something about obtaining a vaping device from staff but that they didn't believe the allegation and had no additional information about the allegation. When interviewed, S2 denied ever providing a vaping device to a youth in care. S2 went on to state that they do not smoke at work as they do not want youth to smell anything on them. S2 denies that they would ever provide a vaping device to youth in care. Interviews with additional staff indicated that youth tend to recirculate old allegations and rumors, sometimes allegations even prior to the youth arriving at the agency, including this same allegation related to staff providing vaping devices or allowing youth to take a hit off their personal vaping devices but there is no evidence or proof of this currently happening. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) states these recirculated rumors only makes it harder for the agency decipher \\what is happening now versus what is being drug up about old stuff. CEO states that all of this has prompted the agency to implement a policy whereby staff are prohibited from having vaping devices on their persons in the facility, not being allowed to have vaping devices left in plain sight in their vehicles, and their vehicles needing to be locked at all times while on the facility property to deter youth from attempting to obtain them from staff unknowingly. Other confidential interviews with staff and clients failed to corroborate that any staff are providing vaping devices to youth in care. As a result of the investigation and interviews conducted and based on the information obtained from the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office, there was not a preponderance of the evidence that staff providing vaping devices to youth in care despite the allegations made by youth. As a result, the allegation that staff are providing vaping devices to youth in care is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Exit interview was conducted with Ms. Gleason and documentation, along with appeal rights were provided.",

LPA Hill interviewed youth in care about how this happened and youth indicated that they planned, in advance, to outnumber staff during outings. LPA Hill found that staff did not know that this was planned and upon seeing it unfold, they got the youth out of the store and returned to the facility. LPA Hill did provide counseling to the agency about conducting searches when situations such as this come about. In addition, LPA Hill advised that the staff, knowing that youth were out of sight during the outing and inside a store where contraband is readily available, call ahead of their return to the facility to allow time for the facility staff to contact responsible parties and obtain permission to search youth prior entering the facility.

LPA Hill toured the facility inside and out and observed the following in this home: * Main floor of the home has the kitchen area, dining area with seating for eight, living room area, one half restroom, staff room where chemicals and client files are to be stored. The dining room has a cabinet where the medications are to be stored and this cabinet has a two lock system for all medications and first aid supplies to be stored in. * Second floor of the home has two dual occupancy rooms and two single occupancy rooms that have all of the required furniture. Additional furniture, bedding and other needed supplies are coming with the relocation of the youth for their current location. This floor also has one restroom centrally located and accessible to youth and the other restrooms is in the master bedroom. These are full restrooms, including showers, sinks, toilets, and other necessary storage. Since the cabinets in the restrooms cannot lock, there will be nothing stored in these restrooms that cannot otherwise be accessible to youth in care. * Basement floor of the home is where the youth will be doing schooling, therapy or other activities in the home. This floor has a restroom as well as storage closets that will not be accessible to youth. There are desks in the garage that will be placed in this space for therapists and/or youth to use for schooling. * Linens and other excess items will be stored in the garage area. Laundry area is in the garage. * Outdoor area of the facility was observed to have rubbish from trees and log/wood piles that all need to be removed. Ms. Randle informed maintenance that this needs to be attended to immediately. LPA Hill also observed tree rounds in the yard and suggested possibly a seating area be designed for youth to sit outside on using these rounds but if the facility is not going to utilize them then they need to be removed. * Smoke detectors were functioning and carbon monoxide detectors are on every floor. LPA Hill and Ms. Randle discussed the submission of the Program Statement and Plan of Operation by 7/1/24. LPA Hill observed that the facility is ready for licensure and will provide the recommendation as needed to the management. End of document.",

LPA Hill discussed the following with Ms. Randle: Incident report dated 10/23/24 where C1 (see LIC811 dated 10/24/24) threatened to report a staff for inappropriately touching them for removing C1's cell phone from their bedroom while sleeping and that C1 was placed on a cell phone restriction due to \"multiple violations\". LPA Hill advised the agency that when writing incident reports, the staff need to be detailed on what violations the youth violate that caused the restriction from the phone. Staff should not be writing \"multiple violations\" as this is too vague and could lead to further allegations/investigations related to personal rights violations. This concludes the investigation related to this incident report. No citations was issued. Incident report dated 10/8/24 where C2 was administered an incorrect dosage of medication. LPA Hill was unable to obtain the medication transfer sheet, but did obtain proof of staff retraining related to this medication error. This concludes the investigation related to this incident. No citations were issued. Incident report dated 9/23/24 where C2 was sent home from public school due to a behavior and being placed on \"sick day protocol\" including being in their room and secluded from peers and staff for the day. LPA Hill advised the agency about being excessively punitive regarding behaviors as this does not appear to be trauma-informed. Ms. Randle states that they are send a memo to all staff indicating that no youth should be placed on \"sick day protocol\" unless truly sick and/or displaying symptoms that may deem youth contagious. Ms. Randle to provide the written direction put out to staff. No citation issued. Youth closing bedroom doors - LPA Hill discussed with the agency youth being in their rooms when alone and being able to close their bedroom doors. While the Department is sympathetic with the nature of the program, the agency has an obligation to look at each youth as individuals and develop individual treatment plans and needs and service plans for each youth to meet their individual needs. and not implement blanket type policies that could be interpreted as personal rights violations. Each youth should be assessed individually, and if deemed safe, be able to utilize the time away as a coping skill as long as individual youth safety could be ensured. If safety cannot be maintained, this should be noted in their Needs and Services Plan and a plan to achieve this should be expressed. No citations were issued at this time. Cell phone policy for youth. LPA Hill discussed that the cell phone policy should not include staff going into client bedrooms to remove or retrieve youths' cell phones if they fail to turn cell phones in per their cell phone policy. LPA Hill advised that review of the cell phone policy, as well as other policies youth sign upon admission, should include frequent review of the policies to ensure youths' understanding of policies signed upon admission and are required to follow. This policy is under review at this time by Licensing as it is part of the agency's Program Statement submitted during relocation of the facility. No citations were issued at this time. LPA Hill concluded the inspection and exit interview was conducted with Ms. Randle.",

    "narrative": "Youth and staff interviews failed to identify any witnesses to the alleged hit. Further interviews with staff to whom the disclosure was made indicated that when C1 made this disclosure, C1 had no bruises or marks to indicate being hit. As a result of the information obtained, interviews conducted and documentation obtained, the allegation that C1 was hit by S1 is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. The allegation that staff deny youth time away is related to staff not allowing youth to take space during the schooling hours at the facility. LPA Hill conducted confidential interviews with staff and youth present at the facility during schooling hours and it was revealed that the agency is temporarily providing educational services in the residential facility until their educational site, same as the administrative site, has completed their construction to allow youth to move back to this site for educational instruction. S1 and S2 indicated that on most days they are the primary staff responsible for educational services to youth in care as well as the supervision of youth during the schooling hours. Staff indicated that this facility is a tri-level facility and that having youth on different levels presents a challenge for supervision during the educational hours so they typically keep all youth in the lower level of the facility during schooling hours. Staff state they typically have five or six youth attending the educational services provided at this location with two to three staff present to supervise and assist. Staff interviews indicate they are responsible for supervision of youth during these hours, including maintaining visual of youth. While staff try to give youth options of taking space when feeling overwhelmed or agitated, it is restricted to direct line of sight of staff. Staff states that when the staffing allows for additional staffing at the facility during schooling hours they can accommodate walk-abouts or other services youth request. Confidential interviews with youth also indicated that they can walk outside if they want to take space or need a break as long as they remain in sight of staff supervising. As a result of the information obtained and interviews conducted, the allegation that staff deny youth time away is UNSUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning the allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

S2 was terminated from employment on 5/20/25 and S1 resigned their employment from the agency on 5/20/25.

    "narrative": "While C1 left the facility on an unauthorized absence and upon apprehension by law enforcement, was taken for further assessment. Youth were told by staff that C1 would not be returning and to move on and not speak about the events. C1 returned to the facility prior to youth waking up in the morning and without warning to youth in care. Other youth in care reported that they did not feel safe with C1 returning to the facility due to the magnitude of the events that took place. Following such events happening in the facility, youth typically have access to an on-call therapist, via teleservices but youth in care expressed that there was a need to be able to process the events of the incident as a group but this was not offered or conducted. Confidential interviews indicated that youth did not feel that staff could keep them safe due to the seriousness of the incident with C1 returning to the facility without preparing youth in care and without providing youth the ability to process the incident in a trauma informed manner. Additional confidential interviews further indicated that the seriousness of this incident scared both, youth and staff, and brought about past traumatic experiences that youth would have benefitted from having a therapist present to assist in processing the events immediately following the incident. Confidential interviews indicated that youth and staff alike expressed that having a therapist come to the facility when an incident of this magnitude occurs would allow the youth to process as a group and assist youth in feeling safe, heard, and supported. It was further discussed that telling youth to stop talking about the event and not giving youth an avenue to discuss the events of the incidents in a safe and supportive space, is not trauma informed and does not allow youth to process their past traumatic experiences brought up by incidents of this nature. Confidential interviews further indicated that having the therapist available via a video chat is not the same as the in-person collaboration and youth tend to not engage in the video collaboration offered. As a result of the investigation conducted, including confidential interviews, the allegation that staff did not provide a safe environment for youth in care is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard has been met. The facility was cited for violation of Short Term Residential Therapeutic Programs, Interim Licensing Standards, Section 87078.2(a)(3) Trauma-Informed Interventions and Treatment Practices as staff are required to understand the types of trauma experienced by children..., how to provide care and supervision that is trauma informed..., and how to reduce risk of re-traumatization. The youth were not provided the trauma informed care necessary following a serious incident that would have allowed youth to process their trauma experiences and move forward in a trauma informed manner.",

A CSW expressed concern that the facility was not enforcing the program rules and continued to allow M1 and M2 to go on unsupervised community walks even though they had not earned the privilege to do so. LPA's review of the facility records documented M1 and M2 were on neighborhood walks at the same time. Record review also confirmed that even though M1 and M2 were not following the program rules and continuing to AWOL, M1 and M2 were still allowed unsupervised time for neighborhood walks. Furthermore, LPA's record review provided evidence that the staff failed to follow the approved emergency intervention plan while at the facility and on facility outings. Based on confidential interviews and record review, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove the facility staff are not properly supervising minors (M1, M2) resulting in minors (M1, M2) wandering the neighborhood. The Facility is cited under the Interim Licensing Standards, Version 3, regulation 87022 (f) Plan of Operation. An exit interview was conducted, a copy of this report and appeal rights were emailed to Administrator Amaneece Harrison. A copy of the signed report will be placed in the facility file. CSW's confirmed M1 and M2 had a history of AWOLing. LPA's review of the facility records, and pictures provided by confidential sources, revealed evidence that M1 and M2 left the facility. However, the evidence provided did not demonstrate there was a lack of supervision at the facility. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegation that there was a lack of supervision resulting in minors (M1, M2) AWOL'ing may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence.

S3's staff record not containing S3's driver's license information is a violation of CCR 80066 (a)(2) PERSONNEL RECORDS (a) The licensee shall ensure that personnel records are maintained on the licensee, administrator, and each employee. Each personnel record shall contain the following information: (2)Driver's license number if the employee is to transport clients. A copy of S3's job description was not observed to be in S3's record. This is a violation of CCR regulation 80066(a)(8) PERSONNEL RECORDS (a) The licensee shall ensure that personnel records are maintained on the licensee, administrator, and each employee. Each personnel record shall contain the following information (8) Duties of the employee. On August 5, 2022, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Nicole Strickland arrived to the facility and was greeted by Staff #1 (S1) and Staff #3 (S3). Upon entry to the facility LPA asked to speak to the Administrator and was informed that there was no administrator on site. LPA then asked to speak to Executive Director (ExDir) and was told by S1, ExDir was on maternity leave. S1 and S3 stated House Manager (Staff #4 [S4]) was not present. S3 stated she would call S4 to inform S4 of LPA's presence at the facility. S3 stated that S4 did not answer the phone so S3 was going to text S4. After texting S4, S3 made another attempt to contact S4 which was successful. S3 was informed that Staff #5 (S5) was on his way to the facility and would be able to assist LPA. A review of S1 and S3's personnel record provided no evidence of S1 or S3 being designated to fulfil the role of House Manager when House manager is not present. Therefore the facility is being cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) standard 87065(f) PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS (f) the licensee shall designate at least one facility manager to be present at the facility at all times when one or more children are present: A copy of the report was discussed and provided along with civil penalty assessment LIC 421 and appeal rights to The Refuge House Manager Michelle Hazelwood.",

    "narrative": "On June 15, 2021 at 11: AM, an informal office conference was held virtually with Tiffany's Place Short Term Residential Treatment Program (STRTP) via MS Teams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In attendance for Community Care Licensing (CCL) were: Regional Manager (RM) LaCresha Cook, Licensing Program Managers (LPMs) Stephanie Hudak and Ann Valenzuela, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Gloria Meza-Gonzalez. San Diego County Representatives were: Institution Evaluation Unit (IEU) Program Manager (PM) Natasha Hood, Protective Service Supervisor (PSS), Eileen Marshall, Senior Protective Service Worker (PSW), Andrea Hernandez, IEU Contracts, Sheila Lyn Worthington and Behavior Health Services (BHS), Trang Hoang. Sacramento County Representatives were Program Planner (PP) Linda Abelelbaki, Program Manager (PM) Leslie Olson. Lastly, for Tiffany's Place, present were Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lynn Burgard, Program Administrator (PA) BriAnn Guillen. The following issues were discussed: \u00b7 Complaints \u00b7 STRTP Provisional License During the meeting, LPM Valenzuela discussed increase of complaints at STRTP since facility opened. In 2020, there were four complaints and in 2021, six complaints as of June 15, 2021. STRTP was licensed on September 26, 2019, however, began accepting foster youths in February of 2020. Most of the complaints have to do with personal rights and staff training. PA Guillen was given the opportunity to speak regarding the increase of complaints relating to personal rights training. PA Guillen stated that the staff receive personal rights training during the first 90 days upon hire as well as during staff meetings; and are in the process of updating what training should be done on an annual basis. PA Guillen stated that she does the training however CEO Burgard and the Facility Social Worker can also do the training. LPM Valenzuela stated that staffing needs to be according to the foster youth's needs and there is available funding to increase staff. PA Guillen stated they have reached out for support from San Diego County for additional funds in order to meet the foster youths' needs for additional staffing. PA Guillen stated their current census is two and there are ample staff for two foster youths. LPM Valenzuela asked facility representatives if they are scheduling Child Family team meetings (CFTs) and PA Guillen said yes; it is schedule by the County Social Worker or Facility Social Worker. PA Guillen said that sometimes she attends as well as CEO Burgard. See LIC 809C page Lastly, the status of the STRTP provisional license was discussed. LPM Valenzuela advised Tiffany's Place that their provisional license is set to expired on September 26, 2021. LPM Valenzuela asked if they had hired a Head of Service and CEO Burgard stated yes, they just hired this week and a Head of Service will start on the first or the second week of July 2021. CEO Burgard stated she wasn't aware that the license for Tiffany's Place was going to expire on September 26, 2021. CEO Burgard stated that she was under the impression that as long as she had the Mental Health Approval that the State of California would provide some leeway or an extension for the accreditation process. RM Cook stated that there is no extension beyond 24 months per statute. CEO Burgard had spoken to CARF (accreditation agency) and it was told to her that accreditation should be done within 24 months of receiving a provisional license. RM Cook reiterated that there is no extension to the provisional license past 24 months. LPM Hudak provided information that per the current STRTP guidelines, in order for CCL to justify the extension of the provisional license past the 12-month expiration date, the facility needs to be in the process of obtaining Mental Health Approval and/or Accreditation. CEO Burgard asked if STRTP does not have accreditation by September 26, 2021, then would they need to close the STRTP? RM Cook stated that if the STRTP does not have accreditation then they will need to close as there is no extension available beyond the 24 months. RM Cook asked CEO, what would be their plan? CEO Burgard stated they don't have a plan. CEO Burgard stated in order to get accredited they need to be operating to CARF standards for at least 6 months. She said they just hired a consultant to assist in getting accreditation through CARF. CEO Burgard has a contract with County of San Diego Behavioral Health. CEO Burgard said the accreditation audit will be conducted in December. CEO Burgard stated that the focus was changed when COVID-19 hit, from the accreditation process to the needs of the foster youth. RM Cook clarified for the CEO Burgard that CARF are their own entity and are not a part of CCL. Suggestion was given to check with the other accreditation agencies and see if they can expedite the accreditation process to be completed prior to the expiration date of the provisional license. It was suggested if they cannot complete the accreditation and mental health approval process by the expiration date, the STRTP can submit an application to go through the process to change facility type. Suggestions were given as to alternative facility programs; they can apply for a Group Home for private pay clients or Group Home for Regional Center clients. PA Guillen asked what will happen if they cannot meet the expiration date, can they apply for STRTP again. LPM Hudak said yes, but the STRTP has to wait a year after application denial; the provisional license is considered part of the application process. See LIC809c Page CEO Burgard stated she needs to get information from Department of Health Care Services Associate Governmental Program Analyst (AGPA) Stephen Conn regarding if the accreditation is required to submit their mental health program application and she would be researching accreditation processes, deadlines and their available options. In lieu of the issues presented during this meeting, the STRTP is being required to submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) by June 29, 2021, detailing the following: 1) submit an addendum to the Program Statement regarding what personal rights training entails and who will be conducting the training. Also, PA Guillen had mentioned that she is currently revising the annual training, and CCL requested they include that information in the CAP, 2) submit the last two copies of the board meeting minutes; minutes to include what actions the STRTP will be taking as a result of today's office conference. All recommendations/suggestions and requirements given during the meeting by both CCL and STRTP representatives were acknowledged. In closing, all parties were satisfied with all information that was discussed during the meeting. CCL will follow-up with the STRTP in 14 days. A copy of this report reviewed and emailed to CEO Burgard. Original signature will be placed in file. Amended: A copy of this report was given to PA Guillen.",

During the course of the investigation, LPA Bertoli inspected the facility, interviewed 3 youth, 4 staff, and 2 social workers, and reviewed documentation. LPA confirmed through interviews with staff and clients that staff engaged in a struggle with client C1 (see LIC 811 dated 10/29/21) over possession of a blanket that C1 wanted to take outside to keep warm. It was also confirmed by interviews with staff and clients and Incident Reports that doors were removed from client's bedrooms. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that staff violated personal rights of clients. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. Title 22 deficiencies were cited regarding the struggle with the blanket and an Advisory Note was issued regarding door removal. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the facility.

Lastly, statements alleging minor being sexually assaulted by another minor in care were not corroborated during the investigation.

Staff #2 (S2) told C1 that C1's staff from the Panther's dorm had already came and got the heater. S2 told C1 the heater in the Aztec's dorm belonged to the Aztec's. Then S1 said,\" There's nothing you can do about it. You're not going to take this (heater).\" S1 said to C1, \"What are you going to do about it.\" C1 got really quiet. C1 said, \"Okay, really,\" and walked out of the dorm quietly. C1 went back to the Panther's dorm. A few minutes later, C1 came back inside the Aztec's dorm. C1 was loud and said in a threatening way, \"Oh, I'm not going to do nothing about it.\" C1 spat on S1's desk and S1's jacket. S1 stood up from behind the desk. S2 got in between S1 and C1 and told C1 to calm down. S1 told C1 to go back to C1's dorm. S1 also asked C1 why C1 spit on S1. C1 kept cursing. Staff from C1's dorm arrived and took C1 back to C1's dorm. The parties denied S1 cursed at, yelled at or threatened C1 during the incident. The LPA received other conflicting information regarding the incident. It was reported to the LPA, S2 would not give C1 the heater. C1 told S2, \"For real.\" S1 stepped in and said, \"She don't gotta fucking explain shit to you. What are you going to do about it?\" C1 went back to the Panther's dorm. Ten minutes later, C1 went back to the Aztec's dorm common area and spat on S1. S1 said, \"You fucking bitch. I'm going to fuck you up.\" S2 got in between C1 and S1. S2 pushed S1 back and said, \"No don't do it, don't do it.\" S1 was yelling at C1, calling C1 a, \"Bitch,\" and saying, \"I dare you to do it again.\" C1 then walked back to the Panther's dorm. The facility provided the LPA with a flash drive of the surveillance camera footage of the 03/08/21 incident. There is no audio on the footage. The footage is from the camera four Aztecs East and camera three Aztecs West. The following was observed at the identified time stamps: 22:07: C1 comes into the common area holding a pillow. C1 stands in between the kitchen island and two conference tables while talking. 22:08: C1 leaves the common area and exits the dorm. 22:13: C1 enters the common area and goes behind the kitchen island. C1 stops a few feet past the end of the island. 22:13: C1 makes a spitting motion towards the first desk on the left hand side of the screen. *** *** 22:13: S1 gets up from desk and walks towards C1. S2 gets up from her desk and runs towards C1 and S1. S2 gets in front of S1 and is between S1 and C1. S2 walks backwards and uses her body to push S1 back. S2 also uses her outstretched arms to escort S1 backwards. 22:13: C1 turns around and walks to the door C1 came in from. S3 comes out from behind a desk on the opposite side of the common area and walks towards C1. A fourth staff comes in through the door that C1 used to enter the dorm and leaves with C1. 22:13: S1 and S2 walk back to their desks. Appears S1 is wiping off an object.

During interviews conducted by Special Investigator (SI) Dennis Douglas with the California Department of Social Services, (CDSS), Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD), Investigations Branch Bureau, it was revealed that the facility operated outside of the State regulated staff to client ratio. Consistent confidential interviews disclosed on 04/23/23 the facility had 15 clients and 3 staff in which the facility was not within ratio. Confidential interviews disclosed that the facility was outside of ratio due to three staff members calling off on this date. Consistent confidential interviews further reported that while the facility operated outside of the State regulated staff to client ratio resulted in C2 breaking into a room at the facility, confining self in a room, and in an altercation between C1 where C1 sustained serious injuries while in care. Based on information obtained, the facility operated outside of required client to staff ratio; facility is cited for violation of Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) version four SECTION 87065.5(b)(1)(C) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios which posed an immediate health and safety risk to clients in care.

    "narrative": "During the investigation, all confidential interviews revealed that there was an altercation between C1 and C2 that resulted in C2 stabbing C1 while in care. Confidential interviews further stated that C2 was exhibiting ongoing aggressive behaviors towards peers and staff that included breaking facility windows, and handling glass, while in care. Confidential interviews also stated that S1 did not intervene during the altercation between C1 and C2 that resulted in another client intervening, where ultimately C1 sustained multiple stabbed wounds while under the care and supervision of S1. Other confidential interviews reported witnessing S1 giving verbal commands to C1 and C2 to stop the altercation from outside, but it was not enough to stop the fight and prevent C2 from stabbing C1 in care. Confidential interviews further maintained that S1 did not intervene during the altercation and that it was C3 who attempted to stop the altercation but was unsuccessful. Other confidential interviews stated that based on C2's history and individual needs C2 required one-on-one care however, the facility did not provide that type of care and supervision posing a risk to self and others resulting in C1 being stabbed by C2 in care. All confidential interviews reported that due to C1's stab wounds C1 required medical intervention due to the seriousness of injuries sustained from being stabbed by C2 while in care. Based on confidential interviews and record review the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegation that due lack of supervision, C2 stabbed C1 in care resulting in serious injuries is supported and proven by evidence, therefore the allegation is substantiated at this time. The facility is cited, and immediate civil penalty was issued for violation of California Code of Regulations (CCR) regulation 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (a) The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. An enhanced civil penalty (ECP) determination is pending. If an ECP is assessed a Community Care Licensing (CCL) representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment.

On September 13, 2023, the Department concluded a complaint investigation alleging that staff #1 (S1) did not provide supervision to meet the needs of children in care, resulting in client #2 (C2) sustaining multiple stab wounds to the leg and arm. These allegations were determined substantiated, and the STRTP was cited from the Title 22, California Code of Regulations Section 80078 (a), Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. The citation included an immediate civil penalty assessment of 500.00. See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated September 13, 2023. Based on the analysis of the interviews, medical reports and findings from the San Bernardino Sheriff report the Department has determined that an enhanced civil penalty is warranted for S1 neglecting to supervise and provide care and supervision to meet the needs of the children in care. The Penal Code Section 243 defines serious bodily injury as a serious impairment of physical condition, including, but not limited to a wound requiring extensive suturing. This section describes a number of more or less direct and (always) willful acts that constitute physical abuse. Pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty law, Health & Safety Code section 1548 (f)(1)(C), the Department will be issuing an immediate civil penalty of $2,000.00.

During the investigation there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegations. It was revealed that C1 had a history of substance use, specifically engaging in marijuana use prior to arriving at the facility. Some confidential interviews denied that C1 engaged in illegal activity on facility grounds while other confidential interviews reported witnessing C1 smoking marijuana on facility grounds without staff knowledge. Other confidential interviews denied observing C1 having access to an unknown substance specifically a white powder substance while in care. Confidential interviews further reported that C1 was out of the facility often and did not have access to a phone while on facility grounds. Confidential interviews also stated that C1 would \"brag\" to peers about engaging in illegal activity while out of care but was not observed engaging in these behaviors while at the facility and under staff supervision. However, it was reported to LPA that C1 was observed to be in possession of an unknown white powder substance in care, and the substance was confiscated by a facility staff member and discarded. Other confidential interviews denied the incident or having knowledge of the information. Confidential interviews further reported that incidences involving illegal activity or drug paraphernalia are reported, and items are provided to administrative staff for further action. There were no other known witnesses to the allegations. The department received inconsistent statements about whether the allegations of C1 engaging in illegal activity, and C1 having access to an unknown substance occurred while in placement and under staff supervision or while C1 was out of care. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegations that staff did not prevent a minor from engaging in an illegal activity, and that staff did not prevent a minor from having access to an unknown substance, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegations that staff (S2) hit minor (C1) while in care and staff (S2) is engaging in inappropriate behavior are substantiated. The facility is being cited for Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Version 4, Personal Rights (c) (10). The facility did not ensure their dignity was accorded with staff while in care. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report LIC 9099 and the appeal rights were discussed and provided to Administrator Diana Bustamante. Other confidential interviews denied staff not preventing clients from being absent from care and reported staff communicating the importance of not being absent without permission. Per confidential interviews, the staff is doing all they can to prevent clients from leaving the facility, and if clients do leave, staff will follow the clients to encourage them to return to the facility. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegation that there is no prevention made for clients to AWOL may have occurred, however, this is not supported by evidence.

The purpose of this inspection is for a case management involving an incident with Staff (S1), and two Clients (C1, C2). On July 24, 2025, Community Care Licensing observed a video involving S1, C1, and C2. The video footage was taken of the Cottage's back patio with windows and glass doors that were uncovered and allowed a clear view into the inside of the Cottage living area. LPA observed that on June 5, 2025, at 12:00 am, C1 knocked on the patio doors and entered the Cottage with a scooter. C1 began to ride the scooter in the living room area and S1 grabbed the scooter and C1 and S1 struggled over the scooter and S1 pulled the scooter with enough force that C1 stumbled on their feet. A few seconds later, S1 engaged in a restraint with C1, which led to C1 and S1 falling onto the ground and struggling with each other until S1 got up and walked away from C1. Based on LPA's observation of the video recording, S1 did not ensure that C1 was accorded dignity within their personal relationships with staff, due to grabbing the scooter away from C1 and engaging in a struggle over the scooter which resulted in C1 stumbling on their feet and based on LPA's observation of the video footage showing S1 mishandled C1 when S1 swept C1's leg causing C1 to transition onto the floor during the encounter which led to C1 and S1 struggling on the ground and S1 turning C1 on their back and held down until S1 got away from C1, the facility is being cited for one deficiency. The facility is cited for violating Interim Licensing Standards, STRTP, Article 06. Continuing Requirements, 87072(c)(15) Personal Rights. *** An exit interview was conducted.

Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA David Torres observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident.

    "narrative": "On 4/21/2021 at 3: PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Shikya Belfield, Licensing Program manager (LPM) Saxon Turner, and Regional Program Manager (RPM) Nelson Martinez, met with Tyler House representatives; Director of youth and family services for Encompass, Lindsay Steigner, program Administrator Janet Martin, and Quality Improvement Manager Linda Alves. The purpose of this meeting was to conduct a Case Management inspection. This inspection was conducted to present Enhanced Civil Penalties (ECPs). On 4/22/2020, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received a complaint (Control #26-CR-20200422101443) alleging a 13-year-old client (C1) had been sexually assaulted by an 18-year-old client (C2) (See LIC 811-Confidential Names List dated 4/22/2021. The complaint was investigated by CCL's Investigation Bureau (IB). At the time of the investigation, the police report was unavailable. Based on interviews conducted, IB came back with a finding of Unsubstantiated and findings were delivered on 8/21/2020. In November 2020, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Saxon Turner received information from the Santa Cruz County Juvenile Probation Department that C2 was in jail and awaiting trial for the sexual assault of C1. Based on this new information, a request was made to IB to re-open the investigation, which occurred on 11/30/2020. Based on additional interviews conducted with staff and clients, as well as in addition to obtained reports, including the police report, sometime prior to 4/11/2020, C2 forced C1 to orally copulate him in the facility living room when no staff were present. On or around 4/11/2020, C2 again tried to force C1 to orally copulate him, which C1 refused. C2 then forced C1 to masturbate him. Upon C2 ejaculating, C1 wiped her hand on the couch pillow. This second occurance happened while staff was in the living room; however, staff acknowledged he was not paying adequate attention to the clients. C1 informed staff on 4/21/2020 that she had been sexually assaulted. Staff contacted the Santa Cruz County Police Department (SCPD), who came to the facility and interviewed clients, as well as collected the facility couch pillow that C1 indicated would have DNA evidence on it. Testing on the pillow concluded that the DNA on the pillow was a match for C2. The SCPD issued a warrant for C2's arrest for sexual assault. Based on the evidence in this investigation, C1, a minor, was sexually assaulted by C2, an adult, due to a lack of care and supervision. On 3/2/21, the facility was issued the substantiated findings and a citation under Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Chapter 7.5, Version 3, Article 6, Section 87078(a)-Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. During a Non-Compliance Conference conducted on 3/16/21, licensee was informed that the issuance of an ECP based on Health and Safety Code 1548(f)(1)(C)(i) and (f)(1)(F)(2) was still being determined. CCL has conducted an analysis and has determined that an ECP is warranted for sexual abuse due to a lack of care and supervision under Penal Code 11165.1(b)(2) & (4). Today, 4/21/2021, CCL is issuing an ECP per Health and Safety Code 1548(f)(1)(C)(i) for $2,500.00.",

All staff are trained in CPI, in the event that youth is an immediate danger to self and others, and all de-escalation strategies did not work, then staff will engage in restraint procedures. FM stated that they had a recent training in regards to restraints. They watched videos, shared methods on effective ways to de-escalate youth before using restraint as their resort, and safety precautions. LPA Ng requested training to be sent by July 4th at 4: PM.

Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, monthly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

Interviews conducted with another client had similar statements of an incident occurring where they observed a child being restrained by staff. However, this third client was unable to specify the details of why staff restrained the client or if client was in distress based on the restraint. Another client stated that one staff did grab and restrained them till the point of almost breaking their arm. Client identified two staff members who conducted the restraint; however, client was unable to provide any witnesses that could attest to how the staff handled them during the restraint or when it specifically happened. Staff stated that multiple incidents have occurred with one client where client was having an issue of acting out causing harm to others and client was not listening to staff's redirection. Staff had similar recollections in stating that in these incidents that occurred client was restrained with their arms placed behind their back and staff asked client if they had calmed, client stated they had calmed so staff released them from the hold. However, staff stated once client was released client started attacking staff again. Client was placed back in the same restrained position until client in fact was calmed down. Staff stated client was checked over and did not express any discomfort or present with any injury. Staff stated that when clients are acting out in self injurious or harmful behaviors to others, they do place clients in restrained positions of holding the client's arms behind their back till they are calmed and listening for redirection. However, staff denied twisting a client's arm to the point of breaking or almost breaking client's arm. Staff had similar statements in that if a client calls out in distress of any sort during the restrained period staff release the client. Staff further stated that they consistently ask client if they have calmed to release them from the restrained position. LPA reviewed incident reports and supportive documents provided by facility and no complaints were made or incidents documented where a client was taken to the hospital for injuries after being placed in a restraint. LPA was unable to contact county social worker, but no documents identified a problem with clients placed in the home or facility staff. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report Confidential Names Form, and Appeal Rights were provided to the facility representative.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that C1 was hit, handled in a rough manner, and spoken to inappropriately by S2 during an alleged physical altercation. Information obtained from confidential interviews with the above individuals revealed that an incident did occur involving S2 and C1. S2 denied the alleged allegations stating that C1 was questioned regarding C1's soiled garments and the feces left in the washer. S2 indicated that C1 was verbally redirected to C1's room after being belligerent and giving S2 the middle finger. S2 indicated that C1 walked towards the room and started breaking items in the room and attempted to stab S2 with a pencil. S2 further indicated that a standing MAB hold was attempted however C1 dropped to the floor and at this point, S2 was replaced by S3 to de-escalate the situation. Information obtained from S3 and S4 indicated that C1 has behavioral and defiant difficulties, which are addressed via a plan to assist C1 with finding alternative ways to self-deescalate. S1 denied the allegations further stating that the information reported to the hotline by (S1) was not accurately documented by the screener due to having S2 as the aggressor and punching C1 which is not accurate. S2 provided LPA with several SIR's involving C1 and notating aggressive behavior, as well as a letter from the Head of Services to the Department of Human Services, expressing concerns due to C1's conduct and its effect on staff and other residents' safety. Information obtained from C2, C3, and C4 denied the alleged allegation indicating that C1 was the aggressor. During interviews with C2, C3, and C4, it was further disclosed that staff are very professional with them and provides whatever is needed. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the Facility Representative. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time.

    "narrative": "The staff members (S1, S2, and S3) refuted the allegations, asserting that all staff members are trained in trauma-informed care and have completed a sixteen-hour course on the Management of Assaultive Behavior (MAB) focused on crisis negotiation and intervention. The staff indicated that the facility is hands-off and will only use MAB intervention to prevent clients from self-harming or to prevent bodily injuries to others. The staff further disclosed that on the day of the alleged incident, S2 did restrain C1 from behind due to C1 attempting to strike S1 in the face with a closed fist, and in doing so, slipped and fell to the ground with C1. S2 noted that they remained on the floor for no more than ten to fifteen seconds before S1 assisted them in getting back on their feet and escorted C1 to their room without further incident. S2 indicated that no injuries were sustained, and the incident was reported promptly to all supporting agencies. The statement received from C1 revealed that they became aggressive towards the staff and tried to hit S1 in the face with a closed fist after being instructed to return to their room because of their inappropriate conduct at school. C1 denied sustaining any injuries during the incident and subsequently retracted the allegations during the interview. Information gathered from C2 and C3 confirmed that they were present during the incident and corroborated the details provided by the staff. C1, C2, and C3 expressed that they feel safe living in the facility and believe that the staff is helping them achieve their personalized plans. Additionally, CSW1 mentioned that the facility staff are highly attentive and supportive, frequently communicating with them about matters concerning C1. CSW1 further disclosed that they have no concerns regarding the care and supervision provided by the facility staff for their client. Therefore, based on the information received, the above allegation(s) is determined to be unsubstantiated. Although the allegation(s) may have happened are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are found to be unsubstantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the STRTP Administrator. There are no deficiencies to be cited at this time. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of the report along with the (LIC 811) was left with the STRTP Facility Administrator.",

The goal is not to surrender the license at this time to keep options open and to serve the clientele when necessary. The house is currently being renovated and Ms. Evans will notify CCL when clients can be accepted and an inspection will be completed at that time. The house will be physically ready within 14 days however staffing issues will not be resolved that quickly. Juanita Arroyo, Licensing Program Manager, was present on a phone conference during this visit. Ms. Arroyo will look into the options and will be conferring with the Regional office to determine the appropriateness for the tentative plan and the STRTP remaining in compliance. Other issues discussed included changing Administrators and decreasing capacity on the other home. Ms. Evans to follow up with LPA Bruce and submit correspondence accordingly.",

Confidential interview stated that they feel safe when driven by staff. Confidential interviews reported that clients are given privacy, and on occasion staff may need to enter their room, after knocking, if there is no response.

    "narrative": "On September 26, 2024, Community Care Licensing received a complaint alleging, facility staff engaged in sexual interactions with minor in care, facility staff provided drugs to minor in care, facility staff used drugs with minor in care, and facility staff inappropriately handled minor in care. It was reported that S1 had been having sexual contact with male minors in the home and S1 had also been using drugs with the minors. It was reported that a client witnessed S1 use drugs with a client and S1 had taken the client out on dates alone. Regarding the allegation that facility staff engaged in sexual interactions with minor in care, a confidential interview revealed that S1 and C2 were sexually involved. Confidential interviews revealed that S1 was known to have taken C2 on a one-on-one outing for pizza, which took longer than usual. A confidential interview revealed that S1 was given permission to transport C2 to purchase pizza in a neighboring town which was not within proximity to the facility, causing the outing to take longer than usual. A confidential interview corroborated the explanation of why the outing took longer and confirmed S1 received permission to do so. Confidential interviews revealed S1 previously transported other youth in the facility on one-on-one outings and confidential interviews did not reveal any unprofessional or inappropriate interactions between S1 and C2 or any other clients in care. Regarding the allegation that facility staff provided drugs to minor in care, a confidential interview revealed that S1 provided cocaine to C2 and other minors in care. Confidential interviews did not corroborate the allegation and denied S1 was ever seen or known to have provided clients in care with any kind of illicit substances. Confidential interviews revealed that staff conduct self-checks and pocket checks for contraband after clients return from outings. Confidential interviews revealed that staff have found marijuana contraband on clients but have not found any paraphernalia or evidence of cocaine. Regarding the allegation that facility staff used drugs with minor in care, a confidential interview revealed that S1 took drugs with clients in care. Other confidential interviews did not corroborate the allegation, and confidential interviews revealed that S1 was not seen under the influence. Confidential interviews denied S1 was ever seen or known to have provided clients in care with illicit substances and additionally, confidential interviews also revealed S1 was not seen with drugs or paraphernalia. Continued... It was reported that while C1 was confronting S1 about the allegations stated above, S1 was standing in a doorway and proceeded to shut the door on C1's face hitting C1 on the face with the door. Regarding the allegation that staff inappropriately handled minor in care, a confidential interview revealed that S1 shut the door on C1's face while standing in the door frame of the garage door after S1 allowed for C3 to enter. Confidential interviews revealed an incident that was reported to CCL on September 16, 2024, in which C1 became upset after being told to wait for a client to exit the garage before entering. A record review indicated that S1 was exiting the garage when S1 saw C1 and another client in care roughhousing. C1 and another client requested a drink from inside of the garage, and S1 allowed one client to go in at a time and requested C1 wait to enter until the other came out. According to the record review, C1 became upset and barred staff from closing the door, however, shortly after S1 was able to close the door completely. Confidential interviews did not reveal any witnesses to the reported incident, however, confidential interview confirmed that facility staff limit the number of clients in the garage due to the garage housing client information and serving as a staff office. The investigation did not provide information on how S1 was able to get the door to fully close. Based on interviews and review of records, the allegations that facility staff engaged in sexual interactions with minor in care, facility staff provided drugs to minor in care, facility staff used drugs with minor in care and, facility staff inappropriately handled minor in care are all unsubstantiated. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted with Taylor Baez, Supervisor. A copy of this report and appeal rights were provided and reviewed with Taylor Baez, whose signature on this report confirms receipt of these documents.",

    "narrative": "During the investigation, LPA Saeteurn interviewed clients (C1-C3), staff (S1-S4), one witness (W2), and reviewed facility pertinent records. Confidential interviews confirmed the verbal exchange that took place on September 23, 2024, in which C1 was attempting to enter the facility garage and S1 informed C1 they were not allowed in the garage. Confidential interviews revealed that S1 was standing in the doorway entrance to the garage, preventing C1 from entering, due to C2 receiving medications from S2 in the garage and C1 having a history of attempting to retrieve restricted items from the garage. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 was challenging S1 to do something about C1 attempting to get into the garage when S1 proceeded to walk towards C1. A review of a Special Incident Report (SIR) submitted by the facility to CCL detailed that C1 tried to run through S1 to get into the garage where a client had just entered to take their medication in privacy. The SIR included that S1 blocked C1 at the doorway and, with arms extended, redirected C1 out of the doorway, and secured the garage behind them. A confidential interview indicated that S1 pushed C1, however other confidential interviews revealed that S1 did not throw or push C1, but rather S1 proceeded to walk towards C1 with their arms out. Confidential interviews revealed that during the process in which S1 walked towards C1, C1 jumped back and fell onto the floor. A confidential interview indicated that C1 exclaimed, \"S1 put hands on me\" and proceeded to get up to walk to their room. The investigation did not yield witnesses to corroborate that S1 mishandled C1 during the exchange. Based on interviews conducted and record review, the allegation that facility staff mishandled a minor while in care is unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted with Joshua Harris, Administrator. A copy of this report and appeal rights were provided and reviewed with Joshua Harris, Administrator, whose signature on this report confirms receipt of these documents.",
