    "narrative": "Continued from LPA made four attempts to interview another Transitional Housing client. Client would not participate in an interview, but texted one sentence saying they had no concerns about their placement. Law enforcement contact records indicate police were called to a Transitional housing, minor dependent, mentor home twice on 7/5/21 and 10/10/21 due to unknown persons breaking into the backyard and banging on the windows. Suspects had fled before police arrived. Interviews and record review were inconsistent regarding whether the mentor was home at the time of the break-ins in the backyard. Interviews indicate the mentor home is located in a high crime area, near a park where individuals are often seen using drugs. A youth and mentor corroborated an additional break-in of a transient individual entering the home and demanding water, but police were not called, as the individual left the home without conflict. Based on interviews and record reviews, although the allegation may have happened, or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the violations did, or did not, occur. Therefore, the allegation the Facility does not provide a safe environment for foster youth is UNSUBSTANTIATED. Facility mentors are not required to be present in the home at all times, but to maintain adequate supervision to protect the clients. Mentors and youth acted appropriately by reporting the break-ins to law enforcement and the agency. Exit interview was conducted.

Clients were absent from care for extended periods of time while unsupervised by mentors or case workers. Facility policy indicates case workers will stop by the homes when the mentors are absent but there was no record of regular visits to the homes while the mentors were away. Records and interviews indicated the facility did not provide supportive services to ensure transportation to school for one client. The client was in care for over two months and only attended school for one-half day. Truancy was reported to be a result of the client not securing transportation. Records reviewed and interviews conducted demonstrate the facility did not ensure a client's medical needs were met. One client had been prescribed treatment to occur once or twice a week. Interviews and records review demonstrate that this medical care was not facilitated by staff despite being a facility policy. Based on LPA's observations, interviews, and records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegations are found to be SUBSTANTIATED.

During this investigation a virtual inspection of the facility was conducted on 12-17-20. Some copies of documents obtained include a transitional independent living plan for the youth, participant contract and case notes. Interviews were conducted on the following dates: the reporting party on 12-16-20; the youth on 12-28-20; the youth's guardian on 12-29-20; the county social worker on 3-4-21. Staff 1,2,3 and 4 were interviewed on 3-24-21. It was alleged that staff do not treat participants with respect. FY1 (see LIC Confidential Names List, dated 12-17-20) was a participant in the transitional housing program and had received three violations. A meeting was held via ZOOM to discuss the violations an inform FY1 that termination from the program would happen if violations of the policies continued. FY1's guardian, cousin and county social worker also attended the meeting. According to statements made during interviews, there were accusations from the transitional housing staff and FY1's family. S2 stated she felt attacked by FY1's guardian and cousin. According to a statement made one of the transitional housing staff was unprofessional during the meeting and asked to be excused from the meeting. Staff 1-4 stated they were never unprofessional or disrespectful to FY1. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

The incident report stated that a client's dependent (aged 1) was exposed to ant poison while playing in the living room. The client informed a staff member about what had occurred and stated that they weren't sure if the child had ingested the ant poison. The staff member called 911 for emergency assistance. LPA Simien expressed his concern that a child was exposed to ant poison and asked what happened and how the child was able to access ant poison. ED stated that the facility was having an ant issue. ED said the client claimed she was watching the child in the living room while on the phone and then noticed the poison on the child's arm. The client informed a staff member who called 911. The local fire department arrived and checked the child and stated that it did not seem like the child ingested the poison due to no substance being around her mouth. ED explained that the facility took consideration of the child and bought ant traps instead of using ant spray so the child wouldn't be able to touch the poison. ED showed LPA Simien a picture of the trap the facility was using. The trap was a small plastic container with small holes and gel inside. ED speculated that the child probably put the trap against her arm and squeezed it getting gel on it. ED stated that the traps were removed from the facility. LPA Simien informed ED that the facility either needs to find child safe ant traps or find a different solution to the ant problem.

    "narrative": "The interview with C1 confirmed that the client was restricted from outings as discipline and had their phone confiscated for similar reasons. An interview was conducted with C2 (see confidential names LIC811) on August 12, 2021. The interview confirmed that the client was also aware of cell phones being confiscated as discipline and understood that if they got in trouble restrictions on outings would extend on outings with CASA, county social workers or family visits. An interview conducted with facility Manager Shaniz Beza on April 13th, 2021 revealed that C1 had their phone confiscated due to discipline as a result of behavioral issues. Shaniz was unable to recall of any discipline that took place where C1 was restricted from outings due to discipline and indicated that the only recent restrictions that took place were due to COVID19 restrictions and shelter in place orders in 2020. A review of the facility Program Statement revealed that included during admission was a cell phone policy indicating a cell phone would be confiscated as discipline. Based on interviews and document evidence, it was determined that the THPP did confiscate personal belongings of C1 (cell phone) and limited visits of C1. Although regulations allow for confiscation of personal items as part of a discipline policy (86068.2), this must be documented in a Needs and Services Plan and justified as a risk to the Child's Health and Safety. At the time of the file review of C1 on 03/16/2021 there was no Assessment Needs and Services Plan (ANSP) for C1. The ANSP would have documented the Health and Safety Need for the client to have their phone confiscated as part of a discipline program. The regulations also allow limits on outings; however the limits must also be documented on the ANSP. C1 had no ANSP on file to review limits on visitation outside of the THPP. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the THPP violated the documentation regulations. Therefore, the above allegations are substantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the facility manager and deficiencies were cited.",

During the inspection LPA met with Interim Executive Director Shaniz Beza and continued the inspection started on 09/24/2021. LPA and student assistant reviewed 9 staff files at approximately 11:15 am and three client files at approximately 2pm. See confidential names list LIC 811 dated 09/28/21 for names of clients and staff. In the course of reviewing staff files. LPA found that 7 out of 9 staff files did not contain evidence that staff had participated in a one hour child abuse reporting training. LPA and student assistant did observe, that the facility covers child abuse reporting during initial staff orientation; however, the training covers many topics in a one hour span of time. In the course of reviewing three client files at approximately 2:00pm student assistant Hood observed that Client 2 did not contain a signature from their authorized representative and Client 3 did not contain a signature from the client in their respective Assessment Needs and Services Plans. Reviews of the three client Assessment needs and services plans revealed that none contained plans for providing services to meet the individual needs of clients in care. The review of client 1 file revealed that the file did not contain current court authorization for psychotropic medication. LPA and student assistant hood verified that all staff received a criminal record clearance by verifying a roster print out of the Guardian system.

    "narrative": "An interview was conducted with S1 on 09/08/21 at approximately 1:45pm. Staff reported that they had found C1 had left the home without permission on multiple occasions; however, they indicated that C1 responded via text of their whereabouts. In an effort to build rapport with C1, S1 did not report that C1 had left the home without permission to their authorized representative or C1's case manager, S2. S1 admitted that they knew it was required for them to report C1 being absent without permission. S1 provided the facility screen shorts of their efforts to have client come back and keep track of their whereabouts. C1 was responsive to S1's texts and on some occasions sent selfies to show their whereabouts. A review of the screen shots submitted indicated that S1 was encouraging C1 to return the facility. A confidential interview was conducted with the reporting party (RP) on 07/15/2021 at 9am. The RP revealed that the facility failed to report the client leaving the facility without permission and failed to provide adequate supervision of C1. LPA Segura conducted a file review at the facility on 07/21/2021. LPA found that C1 did not have an Assessment Needs and Services Plan developed. Regulations for THPP programs require for a THPP to identify the level of care and supervision a client requires in their Assessment Needs and Services Plan. The facility had not complied with this requirement; therefore, LPA was unable to evaluate the level of supervision the client required. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that facility staff failed to develop an Assessment Needs and Services Plan to assess the need for care and supervision the client required. Further facility staff failed to report the client had left the facility without permission. Therefore the allegations are substantiated. Appeal rights were provided and discussed with Shaniz Beza and deficiencies were cited. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was left with Shaniz Beza.",

Investigator Miles was not able to meet with facility staff or Administrator during this visit as there were no staff available during the hours of operation. Confidential statements obtained revealed the live-in staff often left residents unsupervised, unattended and was unreliable. Confidential statements further revealed that drugs and alcohol were often being used by the residents and other individuals while in the facility. According to the programs House Rules, \"no drugs or alcohol\" are allowed in the home. Based on statements and record reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the allegations are deemed substantiated. A deficiency is cited, California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 7, Plan of Operation. Exit interview was conducted with the Administrator. A copy of this report and appeal rights are discussed and provided. Information obtained revealed a lack of evidence to support or corroborate reported claims. Confidential interviews found not enough evidence to prove the alleged as statements indicate denial and or no knowledge of said allegations. Administrator informed LPA that the THPP once located in Reseda has since been closed and is no longer in operation. Based on gathered information, the allegations are determined Unsubstantiated. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. Exit interview completed. A copy of this report and LIC811 was provided to Facility Representative. Exit interview was conducted.

LPA also reviewed the facility's emergency disaster plan. LPA conducted a review of five client files (C1-C5), which were also provided upon request. All client files reviewed contained the signed admission agreement and discharge policies, as well as signed and up-to-date Needs and Services Plans.

R1 was prescribed three psychotropic medications and two other medications. Licensee has no documentation from R1's doctor stating in writing that the minor is able to self-administer medications. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. The facility is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section Health Related Services. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Regional Program Manager Dyese Hunt and Compliance Director Deb Miller, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA. The youths appeared to be playing but were using the weapons in a menacing way, pretending to target another resident by aiming the gun at them and making repeated stabbing motions with the knife. Licensee confiscated the dangerous items once it was learned through the camera feed that the residents had them. The security camera feed was viewed from the THPP office. The house model is a remote site with scheduled staff check-ins, because the staff do not reside in the house and provide supervision. While increased supervision may have provided greater safety to the residents, it is still possible that the youths could have hidden the items in the house and brought them out while staff was away, as there is no specific stipulation for 24-hour supervision in THPPs. Therefore, it is unclear that a lack of supervision resulted in the youths having access to weapons. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with residents and staff, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Regional Program Manager Dyese Hunt and Compliance Director Deb Miller, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA.",

R1 also informed staff that he was overmedicating, and staff observed the resident to be unstable and have frequent hallucinations and nightmares and talk frequently about conspiracy theories involving feared persons. R1 reported to staff that he was overmedicating due to fear of another resident, R2, who was known to have weapons, as a month prior to the incident in question, R2 was observed on security cameras in the house brandishing a knife with another youth with an airsoft gun.

Further, the plan listed R1's needs as \"no needs...per the youth\" for socialization, emotional support, and mental health support and \"youth presents as highly functional.\" The only need identified is \"weight management / physical fitness.\" Additionally, the plan was handwritten but did not include an authorized representative / case worker signature. R1 turned 18 twenty (20) days after admission to the program, but the needs and services was not developed until fifty-eight (58) days after admission. The plan only pulls from the youth's statements rather than considering the youth's case history, indicates no input or authorization from the case worker(s) or previous case worker(s), and is incomplete with few needs listed despite being drafted after video footage showed the incident at the center of this complaint. The THPP did not ensure that it was safe for youth to be placed in the remote site with little supervision by not assessing the youth's needs at placement nor within the mandated timeframe. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and therefore the above allegations are found to be Substantiated. The facility is being cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 86068.2(a) Needs and Services and Transitional Independent Living Plan. See Section 86068.2(c), which requires needs and services plans to be completed within 30 calendar days from the date of placement. Because R1 turned age 18, LPA advises the facility to review Sections 86168.1(c) and 86168.3(f) as well. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Regional Program Manager Dyese Hunt and Compliance Director Deb Miller, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA. Therefore, it is unclear that a lack of supervision resulted in the youths having access to weapons. The facility has since hired an on-site staff to provide support and supervision. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, based on LPA's observations and interviews with residents and staff, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the alleged violation(s) did or did not occur. Therefore, the allegation is Unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights provided, and a copy of this report left with Regional Program Manager Dyese Hunt and Compliance Director Deb Miller, who agreed to sign the report emailed by LPA Hawkins and return a signed copy to LPA.",

R1 was 'play-threatening' a youth in their room, and R2 was 'play-stabbing' the knife, both to be 'playfully menacing.' R1 was placed in the program as a minor but was age 18 at the time of the incident. R2 was 17. The house model is a remote site with scheduled staff check-ins, and no staff reside in the house and provide supervision.

In addition, interviews and documented submitted to LPA indicated that the facility did not maintain in C1's file C1's valid work permit or work schedule, and authorized representative was not able to confirm C1's employment. Also, when C1 would leave on unauthorized absences, staff would check in on C1 via text, and C1 would check in with staff via phone or by text. However, on-site supervising staff did not always directly notify C1's case manager of unauthorized absences the night priors or authorized representative. It was reported that the facility would allow C1 to leave without a pass or authorization from authorized representative due to feeling that C1 was working hard at work and school. Per authorized representative, when they spoke to the school, they learned that C1 was failing their classes. LPA obtained a copy of (C1) school transcripts, report cards, and this was confirmed to be true. Also, obtained a copy of (C1) progress report from March and (C1) had a total of 9 unexplained absences from 02/22/2021 to 03/16/21. Based on the information obtained, there is a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the facility staff allowed the minor to AWOL, staff did not notify the minors authorized representative of the AWOLs, staff not meeting clients' needs, and staff not checking in on minors. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated. Appeal Rights were provided and discussed with the facility and deficiencies were cited. Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report was left with the facility.",

The following individuals attended the Teams meeting: Licensing Program Managers (LPMs) Carolyn Flynn, Helga Wong, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA's) Isabel Mendoza, Vaishali Singh-Sood, Jennifer Baca, Tamara Hill, and Mary Shelton. In addition, CCL met with Deb Miller, Alexander William, Sander Trent, and Frank Delgado. This meeting aimed to discuss the \"SF Resident Deduction\" sheet that LPA Mendoza observed posted in one of the THPP's remote sites on 2/14/22. Unfortunately, our department has not approved the deduction sheet. After further discussion with LPM Jodean Hall, LPA Hill informed the facility the above deduction sheet was not approved or included in the facilities revised program statement which is under review. CCL informed the facility that it was determined that the listed items in the SF deduction sheet were all violations of the client's Personal Rights. All parties on the call agreed that CCL would not accept this, and the facility will no longer use the above deduction sheet. Currently, the facility is working on their final revisions for all three THPP sites out of the Sacramento office. Once the program statement has been approved, the facility will submit a hard copy and an electronic copy to the San Jose regional office (SB and SJ). An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report was emailed to Deb Miller for signature.",

During this inspection, 7 out of Direct Care Staff and 6 out of 7 youth files were reviewed. 2 out of Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 7 youth were interviewed.(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, September 27, 2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the Transitional Independent Living Plan & Agreements and Safety Plans, the licensee uses trauma informed and evidence based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Windom and LPM King observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their policies and procedures when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to THP Program Manager Frank Delgado and Director of Compliance Deb Miller.",

    "narrative": "(page 2) It is alleged that client funds are mismanaged. The investigation revealed that clients do not know how much their stipend payments will be until they receive the funds or the money is deposited in their account. The clients report the amount of payments are never the same which makes budgeting hard. The clients state they do not get an explanation or supporting documents showing what deductions are made or the date of the deduction. When LPA requested accounting documents for additional clients, with details on deductions, staff stated it would take while as they had to gather the data to create a spreadsheet each time a client statement was requested. LPA observed client stipend checks with \"pay to the order of\" in a staff's name and staff's address. Staff stated the checks are made payable to them until a client has a direct deposit set up. Staff cashes the check, gets the client's signature, and then gives the money to the client. Two clients and two county social workers reported money was withheld from emancipation funds after clients exited the program. Staff state that deductions for excessive cleaning or damages to the living units may be withheld from emancipation funds. The facility withholds $100 for non-minor dependents (NMD) and $50 for minors, per month, from their total monthly stipend amount. The facility Plan of Operation does not include a section on emancipation funds. The Plan of Operation does not describe how the facility will account for or handle funds held in a client emancipation account. Client housing agreements indicate deductions may be taken for infractions of the housing policies and cleaning fees may be withheld from an emancipation fund or the monthly stipend. It is alleged that the regional program director (RD) made derogatory remarks to a client. A Placer County Supervisor (PCS) stated that during a Child and Family Team (CFT) meeting the RD made several statements that escalated the youth. PCS stated RD was accusatory and hostile and the youth was escalated by this. PCS stated, \"at one point (the youth) even called RD on her attitude saying she had been rude and disrespectful to others in the meeting by constantly interrupting and negating what they were saying.\" PCS intervened in the CFT meeting because RD said the youth put other residents at risk and was endangering their safety by leaving after curfew. PCS challenged the statement by RD because the other residents were non-minors without a curfew and therefore not at risk by a minor leaving. Two other participants confirm hearing RD speak in a demeaning manner and confirm the youth called RD out about being rude. A Placer County worker (PCW) stated that the lack of professionalism is troubling at best. PCW stated, \"their lack of support is continued trauma and emotional upheaval for participants. There is long-term harm to the youth participating in the program.\" One facility staff and RD deny derogatory remarks were made. One CFT participant refused to speak on the matter. It is alleged that a minor was not provided supervision after a dental sedation procedure. The investigation revealed that a minor was sedated for a tooth extraction and bone graft procedures on 8/28/21. The minor was transported to and from the appointment by a Placer county worker. The facility did not make arrangements for adult supervision at the housing unit the day of the procedure. The regular live-in staff was on a scheduled vacation. Staff stated that the youth only had a tooth pulled and did not think sedation was necessary. A CFT meeting on 5/11/2021 indicates the need for a tooth extraction and bone grafting. CFT meeting notes from 8/11/2021 state dental needs still need to be addressed. (continued on p3) (page3) CSW stated that the minor had high anxiety leading up to the procedure and Unity Care was well informed of the date and the sedation. The facility offered to arrange a Lyft ride. CSW stated staff was reminded that minor would be fully sedated and could not take Lyft. CSW knew staff was on vacation but RD would get a fill-in. Staff knew that minor was struggling with serious mental health issues and had stopped taking medications prior to the dental procedure. The minor was left in the house with two other residents and an on-call phone number written on a white board. Minor stated they were in excruciating pain. Minor went to the refrigerator for something to eat and ended up throwing food and causing destruction all over the house. Help was called and it was determined that minor required hospitalization for a psych evaluation the evening of 8/28/21. Based on the information from interviews conducted and documents obtained the allegations, that client funds are mismanaged, Regional program director made derogatory remarks to a client, and a minor was not provided supervision after a dental sedation procedure, are substantiated. The facility is cited for California Code of Regulations Title 22, division 6, chapter 7, Transitional Housing Placement Program for Minor Foster Children and Non-Minor Dependents Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision and Personal Rights. Although the allegation that client funds are mismanaged is substantiated no citation is issued at this time due to a citation issued on 11/18/21 for this violation. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights discussed and will be emailed to Mr. Johnson and Ms. Miller.",

    "narrative": "It is alleged that a client's needs and services are not met. The investigation revealed that clients are offered therapeutic services once per week or more often if determined necessary. According to a confidential interview the client was participating in therapy and then stopped going. It was stated that the client withdrew from facility workers which made providing additional services challenging. The client's case manager stated the client refused in-house therapy and refused to participate when another option was scheduled. Case manager stated that the client was a no show for their weekly meetings 75% of the time. Client did not participate in monthly Independent Living Skills. Client refused to complete a dental appointment due to provider not offering nitrous oxide. Placer County authorized dental sedation however the facility was unable to support a Saturday appointment. It is alleged that incident reports are not sent to authorized representatives. One social worker reports only receiving incident reports on a client after a 14-day notice to move the client was submitted. One social worker stated getting phone calls and emails from the case manager if there are concerns about a client but did not get regular written reports. Case managers state that staff are trained to write reports when an incident occurs while they are on shift or when they are notified of a situation. The reporter submits the initial incident report to their supervisor or the regional program director who in turn submits the report to CCL and authorized representatives. The facility is participating in a Technical Advisory Program addressing issues with reporting requirements. Based on interviews conducted and documents reviewed the allegations that a client's needs and services are not met and incident reports are not sent to authorized representatives are unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "The Department has investigated the complaint that the participants are not properly supervised to meet their needs and facility is in disrepair. There is one staff from 3: PM until 12: AM, weekdays at the home. There needs to be a staff who lives on site for minors placed in the home. According to the Program statement \"Staffed Sites: Participant (Minors and/or NMD) live in an independent setting in a Unity Care home and do not require constant (24-hour X7 day) supervision. Our Staff Sites are separate for male and female participant. Staffed Sites have Residential Advisors who live at the site.\" This states that Unity Care is not following the Program Statement. There is not a staff available on site during the weeknight and none on weekends. The non-minor dependents are not properly being supervised. Most of the clients in the home are 18 years old. However, there have been incidents of clients sneaking in friends and family members that intrude on other clients in the house. In addition, the Department has investigated the complaint that the facility is in disrepair and found no one in the home have witness or heard of yard fighting, someone being taken to jail on a warrant, cars being broken into, the fire department and ambulance was called for a resident with a medical emergency and the front gate was replaced due to erosion. It was also stated the home could be more organized and cleaner due to clients not cleaning up after themselves. However, it was founded that garbage is being left outside on the side of the home and not properly placed in a trash can. The residents sometimes forget to take out the trash and it piles up. The trash is picked up once a week. Based on LPA's interviews which were conducted and record reviews(s), the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the above allegation(s) (ARE) found to be Substantiated. The facility is cited on the attached LIC 9099D under the California Code of regulations, 86078(B) RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING CARE AND SUPERVISION: The licensing agency retains the authority to require additional staff, including social workers when the agency determines it is necessary to provide for the appropriate care and supervision of the participants and Buildings and Grounds(a) The facility shall be clean, safe, sanitary and in good repair at all times for the safety and well being of clients, employees and visitors.

The agency's Program Directed stated if there were drugs or alcohol being used in the homes an incident report would be filed. The agency staff would communicate with the youth that was using and remind them of program rules. In addition, during confidential interviews it was determined that at least one client is not receiving their monies on the 1st and 16th and at times takes up to one week, this happens randomly. However, all residents agreed they received two payments a month in the sum of $500.00. According to the agency the clients at the homes are given monies twice a month. That will be every 1st and 16th unless it falls on a non-business day or holiday. If a client does not have a bank account, then UCG signs them up for a PEX account. They are able to use it like a credit card. Monies are transferred to the client's PEX account. If the client has a bank account, then the monies are sent to the client's account.

When C3 was interviewed by investigator Bennett, C3 stated that C3 did not take C1 serious when C1 made the allegations. C3 expressed a feeling that C1 was upset with S7 because S7 turned C1 down when C1 made sexual advances to S7. C3 stated that C3 does not feel uncomfortable around S7 and that S7 was like a mom and made dinner for the clients. None of the other clients agreed to be interviewed. When S2 the Program Manager was interviewed, S2 stated that S7 mentioned that C1 was making inappropriate comments that made S7 feel uncomfortable. Based on the investigator's interviews and records reviewed, the allegations that Minors are being sexually abused while in care, Minors were given drugs while in care, Facility is not providing a safe environment for minors in care are unsubstantiated, meaning the allegation lacks a preponderance of evidence to prove that the violation occurred.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that the facility is abusing the emancipation funds release process. Interviews revealed that the emancipation funds process required Unity Care to assist the clients who were interested in participating in the Emancipation Funds process, to save their money while Unity Care would match the amount saved by the clients up to 20% which they would receive at graduation. However, the program was discontinued in January of 2022. Records of eight clients reviewed showed clients received funds at the end of the program. LPA attempted to interview these eight clients. Two clients responded, while a third client was deceased. C4 stated that his understanding was that he received a monthly stipend from UCG and from this stipend UCG opened a savings on his behalf where they saved his money and when he graduated, he was supposed to receive this money. He added that he received money at graduation but does not remember how much. C8 stated that he received some funds but that he did not understand the emancipation funds process or what the amounts he received were for. He also stated he did not remember how much he had received at graduation. A review of the bank's ARH payments from Heritage Bank of Commerce from what appeared to be a checking account containing routine checking transaction. Payments on the statement highlighted wire transfers to three clients while other debit transactions were blacked out. The payments were in the amount of $800.00 to C2, $1,000 to C3 and, $10,492.91 to C4, after their graduation from the program. LPA was unable to determine if the amount refunded was the amount owed to the clients. Based on LPA's confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that facility is abusing the emancipation funds release process is unsubstantiated, meaning that the allegation lacks a preponderance of evidence to prove that the violation occurred. However, LPA did find that funds were commingled in the process. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the Appeal Rights were provided to the Administrator.",

    "narrative": "It was alleged that Staff do not prevent the facility from being in disrepair. The participant alleged multiple repair problems with their unit, including black mold in the HVAC and bathroom, disconnected water heater exhaust, high humidity, leaking dishwasher, missing vent cover, and more. The participant stated they told their Case Worker about these issues and the Case Worker let them know that maintenance requests must be done by the apartment, not by Unity Care. Although the Agency and the Apartment Complex encourage participants to be independent and to notify the Apartment of any maintenance repairs themselves, it was revealed that sometimes, whoever is working at the Apartment, will turn down residents because Unity Care is who is on the lease, not the Non-Minor Dependents. The Case Worker for NMD1 inaccurately told LPA that they cannot put in a maintenance request for the participant, and that the apartment will not accept repair requests from anyone other than the residents. Contrastingly, the Case Worker (CW2) for NMD2 stated they put in maintenance requests for the participants often, especially if the Apartment makes it difficult for the participant to do so. CW2 stated they can do it verbally for small things, or if it is a large repair, such as an HVAC issue, the Apartment will ask Unity Care to put it through \"the portal\". The Community Director of the Apartment Complex stated 90% of the maintenance requests come from Unity Care Case Workers, and not from the participants themselves. When LPA asked the participant if the Case Worker had checked in on the repairs not being completed yet, the participant stated they had not told the Case Worker that the complex hadn't fixed it yet. Although the Case Worker was not aware of the status of the maintenance request and thought the participant was working it out with the Apartment Complex, the Case Worker did not follow up with the participant or assist them when they stated the Apartment Complex would not let them put in the maintenance requests. The Case Worker's response was, repeatedly, that they could not do anything about it and that it must come from the participant, which is not true. NMD2 confirmed that they would overhear CW1 and NMD1, and CW1 sounded like a \"broken record\", continuing to tell the participant the same thing. Because Unity Care knew about the issues within the Apartment, and they did not assist the participant in addressing the concerns, this allegation is Substantiated. (Continued on LIC 9099-C). Regarding the allegation that Staff did not prevent a participant from being exposed to harmful conditions, it was reported that there was mold in the HVAC system and bathroom. CW1 told the participant to contact the Apartment Complex to put in a maintenance request, but the Apartment Complex told the participant the request needed to be put in the \"portal\". The participant asked how to put it in the portal and the Apartment Complex told the participant they couldn't give access to the portal because they aren't the name on the lease. The participant told their Case Worker, who told them to go back to the Complex because they couldn't do anything about it. An interview with the Case Worker revealed that they did not know the Agency process for how to request something to get put in the portal. The Administrator stated the Case Workers contact S3 themselves, who will put it in the portal for them, while CW2 stated they do not contact S3 directly, they tell the Administrator, who gets the request put in the portal for them. As a result of the conflicting statements from Unity Care and staff not providing direct assistance to handle the maintenance issues in the apartment, this allegation is substantiated. Regarding the allegation that Staff did not ensure the HVAC system is properly operating, according to the participant, the HVAC would not keep up with high temperatures and was also bringing in humidity which caused mold to grow and caused breathing problems for the participant. Interviews revealed the Case Workers' only solution to help the participant was to offer to move them to a different unit within the complex. The participant stated they did not want to move, due to the feeling that they have always been moved around too much throughout their life and wanted to establish a home somewhere. When the participant stated they didn't want to move, CW1 did not seek additional solutions to help the participant get the HVAC system properly working. The Participant and the Case Worker both corroborate that when the participant brought up any issues, the Case Workers response was that they needed to file a maintenance request. When the participant tried to with the Complex but couldn't because they told them it needs to be done through the portal, which the participant didn't have access to, the Case Worker told the participant again to go back to the apartment because they couldn't do anything. It was revealed that it is the Case Worker who tells the Administrator, who ensures maintenance requests go through the portal. NMD1 and NMD2 stated CW1 told the participant what they need to do but did not assist the client directly, which is required of the Transitional House Placement Program in teaching participants independence. (Continued on LIC 9099-C). It was also alleged that the participant saw a doctor for respiratory issues due to the unit having high humidity, and the Agency did not take it seriously. The participant stated they began having respiratory issues about a month after their move-in date on 1/9/2025. The participant saw a doctor for respiratory issues on May 30, 2025. The doctor's note revealed the doctor also believed the respiratory issues were from high humidity. The participant told their Case Worker they were having breathing issues from the mold and humidity. The Participant stated the Case Worker's response was, \"Let them handle it\". In an interview with the Case Worker, CW1 told LPA they knew the client went to the doctor, as the participant had told the Case Worker that they took the note to the Apartment Complex, in the hopes that it would speed up the maintenance requests. When asked if CW1 believed they should have assisted the participant in bringing the doctor's note to the office, CW1 stated, \"They want them to do it themselves. I don't think there would be a difference if I went there with the same request.\" Additionally, the Case Worker told the participant that there was, \"nothing Unity Care can do\". When LPA asked CW1 why they didn't tell the Administrator, CW1 stated they did not think there was anything that the Administrator would have been able to do. This Department has investigated the complaints alleging Staff do not prevent the facility from being in disrepair, Staff did not prevent a client from being exposed to harmful conditions, Staff did not ensure the HVAC system is properly operating, and Staff did not address a client's change in medical condition. We have found the complaints to be Substantiated meaning the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The Agency is being cited for Interim Licensing Standards Section 86278(b) RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING CARE AND SUPERVISION, Interim Licensing Standards Section 86065.3(f)(4) SOCIAL WORK PERSONNEL, and California Code of Regulations Section 86030.5(a) IDENTIFICATION OF THPP PARTICIPANT LIVING UNITS on the attached LIC 9099-D pages.

LPA obtained photographs of one house with a sink full of dirty dishes and the kitchen trash can overflowing. During an unannounced inspection, LPA observed the same house to be clean and clutter free. The kitchen sink was clean, the floors were clean, the trash was half full, and the main living area was clean and tidy. LPA observed a client washing dishes at a second location upon entering the house. The client stated that chores rotate and this was his day to wash the dishes. Client stated that sometimes he lets the pots and pans stacked up and then washes them all at once. Client stated that everyone in the house rotates chore duties. It is alleged that client information is not being kept confidential. One staff reported that cabinets used for client files are not locked properly. One staff reported that one drawer of a file cabinet was broken but no client files were stored in the broken drawer. LPA has observed all client files to be locked and secure in the regional office. It is alleged that clients are not receiving necessary services. Clients have access to weekly individual counseling, group counseling, and case management sessions. Two clients confirm they go to individual counseling. One client stated not needing anything. Two clients declined to talk about using services or if services are offered. One case manager had concerns for two clients that present with mental health issues but may not be getting additional services.

The confidential witness did not want to cooperate with IB Investigator and did not reply to attempts made by LPA Raissi. IB Investigator Farquhar and LPA Raissi attempted to conducted confidential interviews of four participants. LPA Raissi conducted three confidential interviews of two Unity Care representatives [Staff 1 (S1) on October 21, 2020, Staff 2 (S2) on March 29, 2021] and [C1's Probation Officer (PO) on February 18, 2021]. LPA Raissi made attempts to contact C1's case manager Staff 3 (S3). LPA Raissi obtained an Incident Report from this agency and other documents pertaining to the investigation. Based on interviews with two Unity Care representatives the clients are no longer participants with this agency. On October 20, 2020, the Department received a complaint alleging, \"clients are smoking illegal drugs while in care\". Based on confidential interviews, there were no further witnesses or information that corroborated clients smoking Methamphetamine at the THPP staff site. All participants have since left placement from the THPP staff site (House 7) and could not be located. Based on three out of three confidential interviews and IB Investigator Farquhar's report findings, the allegation that, \"clients are smoking illegal drugs while in care\" could not be proved. The complaint findings are Unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did or did not occur, therefore the allegation is Unsubstantiated. No deficiencies were cited. Exit interview conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of the report was left at the agency with Administrator, Kenya Kennedy.",

Mentor checks are only issued to participants who perform voluntary tasks for the program. Currently, NMD1 is the only participant who receives a mentor check. Participants receive their allowance checks every 1st and 15th day of the month. However, if the 1st or 15th day of the month falls on a weekend, participants receive their checks the following business day. On Monday, 3/2/20, NMD1 received her allowance check only. It was discovered that NMD1's mentor check had not been signed by the CEO. NMD1 usually receives her mentor check the same day she receives her 1st allowance check for the month. NMD1 stated that she did not receive her mentor check until the following day, 3/3/20. In reviewing the THPP's Program Statement specifically the policies and procedures on handling NMD's funds and allowances, LPA Herring found no written procedures for determining the amount of allowance provided to each participant, and the schedule for disbursement. The THPP also has no procedures for issuing mentor checks. An Advisory Note (LIC 9102) will be issued to the licensee to ensure appropriate procedures are in place.

Based on the information gathered during the solvency audit, the following was revealed: - The licensee does not have sufficient resources necessary to meet operating costs and does not have an adequate financial plan to meet its obligations. - Solvency is the issue for not paying facility operational expenses timely. The licensee is not generating enough income and is unable to meet its operational expenses. - The former executive director (Staff1) entered into an office lease agreement for personal use.

Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, and youth case plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Camara observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.

Discussion to move the process forward included -layout (specifically section headings); -specific required and sometimes repetitive wording; -the need to address discharge policies and procedures and retaining the signed discharge plan in client files; -wording to indicate how the agency can and will request information, such as medical records, but cannot require it of THP participants; and -clarity when addressing some policies and procedures (i.e. \"we will encourage staff\" versus \"staff will\").

    "narrative": "At 11AM, Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives met with the facility above over Microsoft Teams for the purpose of conducting an Annual Review of the facility's program, needs, population, and overstay logs. In attendance in this meeting were: -CCL Regional Manager (RM) Nelson Martinez -Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong -Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Madi Fremont -Kelsey McCoy (Associate Government Program Analyst - Child Protection Policy Unit) -Julie Waters (Child Protection Policy Unit Manager) -ACAC Administrator Mia Buckner-Preston -Michelle Love (Alameda County SSA-CWS Child Welfare Director) Background: The purpose of this meeting was to review the utilization of the receiving center, to evaluate and discuss the Population Reports and Overstay Logs provided monthly by the facility, and to collaborate with the facility on ways that CCL can support the facility going forward. (Continued on Lic809-c) Proposed Questions: At the last Annual Review Meeting with Alameda County, Alameda County shared they had implemented new strategies to help build capacity in home-based care and Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Programs (STRTPs). Question #1: What activities has Alameda County Implemented that have increased capacity in home-based care and STRTPs? Alameda county has continued the following activities: -Recruitment through their website -The use of consultant Hill and Co. -Recruitment efforts with their consultant the Experience, i.e. FFAs and engagement strategies with staff and difficult-to-place youth -Quarterly meetings with FFAs -Preferred placement with REFUGE STRTP -GHs transitioned to STRTPs. Questions #2: What efforts has Alameda County found to be effective in building capacity and reducing the use of the TSCF? Alameda County is still engaged with all strategies to build capacity and expect all will support the goal of locating timely placements and reduce the number of overstays at the AC. Alameda County has identified there will always be a need for the TSCF and none of the strategies will significantly reduce the use of the AC. The County's plan for the next 12 months to continue to build capacity and transition away from using the TSCF is to continue with their recruitment plan to increase homes in Alameda County. The County is currently working with a consulting agency to assess and make recommendations to he County regarding ways to recruit families and agencies, i.e. FP Recruiter, Experience, Meeting with SFAY, M&M with Jim Hill and Company, Client Advocate, and Foster Family Association. (Continued on Lic809-c) Barriers to Placement: What methods is the County using to reduce the repeat overstays from 46 children in 2019 to 13 children (from Jan to Oct) in 2020? -72 hours to conduct a placement search -CFT/Teaming meetings -Case mining for potential relatives -Sharing resources From 2019-2020, in order to decrease the number of repeat overstays, Alameda County re-engaged with two FFAs, and utilized the ability to youths in newly licensed STRTPs. In order to provide more support to caregivers, Alameda County utilized the following strategies/resources: -Placement stabilization services/Technical Assistance -LOC -Foster Parent Association -Funding assistance through gift cards and Discretionary Funds Alameda County has identified that more kids are staying in the county over the 2020 year, over 50%. Impact of COVID-19: Alameda County identified that come challenges or barriers to placements in 2020 directly caused by COVID-19 were reduction in capacity and fear of exposure. The impact of COVID-19 on capacity of home-based care versus STRTP level of care has been identified by the County as follows: -Decreased capacity -Lower wait times on waiting list -Longer intake process -Required COVID-19 tests -Excessive paperwork prior to placement -No transportation support -Limited support with technology (school, visits with parents, visits with social workers) (CONTINUED ON LIC809-C) Alameda County has identified that the cause for delay with Emergency Resource Family Approval (ERFA) is that once children are placed in the home, the process slows down. There have also been delays with submitting paperwork, delays with completing LiveScan clearance, and delays with completing pre-service training. Alameda County is taking the following actions in order to reduce these delays: -Support of assigned placement/RFA CWW to assist with paperwork completion -Financial support and client advocacy Alameda County's timeframe to complete the ERFA remains at 90 days. One barrier identified in the monthly Overstay Reports is lack of capacity. Alameda County has identified the following specific placement types that are lacking in capacity: -Homes for older youth and teens, youth with behavioral and mental health needs, sibling sets, pregnant/parenting teens, and Non-Minor Dependents. -Out of 500 homes throughout Alameda County, only 11 take teens and most of those homes are relatives who do not want to foster when their relative leaves. At the end of this meeting, ACAC representatives inquired about resources regarding the Administrator Certification process, and how to complete Administrator Training during COVID-19. LPA Fremont will research recent Provider Information Notices (PINs) and provide to the facility. This concluded CCL's Annual Review of the Alameda County Assessment Center. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Mia Bucker-Preston with read receipt due to COVID-19 precautions. Administrator Bucker-Preston will sign all documents and return to LPA Fremont over email.",

    "narrative": "On 4/22/22 at 3: PM, Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives met with the facility above over Microsoft Teams for the purpose of conducting an Annual Review of the facility's program, needs, population, and overstay logs. In attendance in this meeting were: -CCL Regional Manager (RM) Nelson Martinez -Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong -Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Alyssa Ng -Adele Gray (Associate Government Program Analyst - Child Protection Policy Unit) -Julie Waters (Child Protection Policy Unit Manager) - Mia Buckner-Preston (ACAC Administrator) -Michelle Love (Alameda County SSA-CWS Child Welfare Director) -Andrea Ford ( Interim SSA) -Melissa Fegurgur (Program Manager) Background: The purpose of this meeting was to review the utilization of the receiving center, to evaluate and discuss the Population Reports and Overstay Logs provided monthly by the facility, and to collaborate with the facility on ways that CCL can support the facility going forward. (Continued on Lic809-c) Question #1: What activities has the County implemented that have increased capacity in home based care and in STRTP's? Website- Applicants can listen to testimonials, review our FAQ, sign up for orientations, and fill out an interest form if interested. Recruitment Efforts- We set up booths at our local community fairs and farmers markets in a limited capacity. A recruiter and volunteers are there to answer any questions and help interested applicants fill our forms. RFA Process- Able to work with their relatives to get them placed. Consultant Agencies- Hill and Associates Consulting and Experience Consultants. Their goal in working with these two agencies is to increase the number of home based resource family placement's for our older youth and teens, CSEC youth, LGBTQI+ youth, sibling groups, pregnant and parenting youth, and Non-minor Dependents. * This resulted in 5 additional homes that accept placement teens. (2 foster family agency homes and 3 county resource family approved homes!) Emergency/Guaranteed beds- planning to enter into contract with 2-3 more STRTP providers. (EX: Lighthouse Mentoring Center, Millie's Youth Services) We are still partnering with REFUGE STRTP as the preferred placement contract and will create a new contract to provide emergency/guaranteed beds (By July 2022). Attend Meetings: Resource Caregiver Association- goal is to seek interest in families providing emergency placements for older youth and teens. The County will provide training, funding, and wrap services to support the placements. The County began working with RFA families who are currently on the \"Inactive\" status list to determine their interest in continuing to provide care for children, youth, and NMDs Foster Family Agency Provider Meeting- offer training and recruitment strategies so that each FFA could recruit and train their own homes Placement Collaborative Meetings- to ensure that by the end of each meeting, the group has identified at least one possible placement for each youth discussed. Quarterly STRTP Providers meetings- By May, the consultant will be in Alameda County to help the County conduct in-person site visits with all Alameda County STRTP providers to observe the day-to-day operations and to survey each provider regarding supports they need to accept, stabilize, and preserve placements of Alameda County dependent youth. Question #2: What efforts has the County made in reducing the use of the Receiving Center? Have these efforts been effective in reducing the use of the Receiving Center? Why or why not? Explore all possible placement options- before bringing a child/youth to the AC. Options include approving visits with relatives or close family friends while placement is being located. Review the youth's electronic file in CWS/CMS- to understand the youth's needs. As a means of finding family the workers also reviews any information about the youth's Network of Support and previous placement providers for possible placement options. Hour Huddles- are conducted once a child, youth, NMD reaches the 48 hour time frame. Current placement options are explored and reviewed, barriers/challenges are identified, and next steps are created, including ways for managers to assist placement efforts. Monitor placement efforts for children ages 0-6 to identify placement timely and eliminate overstays. Support services -are provided and include transportation assistance to placements, taking youth to Medical Clearances and obtaining medication needed prior to placement, requesting funding and gift cards for items needed, including furniture, clothing, food, hygiene and hair supplies. Emergency RFA Placement time frames- to ensure that placement occurs within 72 hours. By 24 hours a relative/NREFM needs to respond and provide information needed to complete clearances on all adults. Within 48 hours the home inspection should be completed. Prior to the 72 hour time frame, the clearances, home inspection, and paperwork needs to be completed so placement can occur. If placement does not occur the child(ren) will be placed in a RFA home. Continue daily In-person meetings- with youth at the AC to engage them in their placement plan and support them during CFTs and placement interviews. Contact STRTPs to provide a response regarding acceptance of placement and assist in completing the STRTP Intake packets. CDSS Technical Assistance calls- for challenging to place youth/youth with special needs Barriers to Placement and Overstays: Question #3: In 2020 the County reported only 13 repeat overstays, but in 2021 the number increased to 43 repeat overstays. What would the County attribute to the significant increase in repeat overstays? ---------Cont. on 809-C-------------------- 2020 was an unprecedented year for us. As 2021, schools started to go back to school. We saw out intake at the center. In the last meeting, AC stated that they expected to return to pre-pandemic numbers (2019). If you look at previous years, 43 repeat overstays are lower than that. Many older youth \"self presented\" at the AC after returning from AWOL from previous placements. AC saw an increase in the number of children and youth brought by Law Enforcement, including courtesy holds from other counties.Due to the reduction of available STRTP beds, long STRTP intake processes that cannot be completed in the 72 hour time frame, and refusal of youth to be placed out-of-county our County may be unsuccessful in eliminating overstays for older youth and teens unless we discharge them once they reach 72 hours whether placement has been located or not. Community based organization MISSSEY now operates at the Assessment Center providing direct services to CSEC youth Monday - Saturday including evening hours. MISSSEY offers training and education to caregivers of CSEC youth to raise awareness of how to best care for and support these youth in their homes. Question #4: What steps will the County take to address these barriers regarding Placement and Overstays? -Please refer to Question 1 in regards to strategies and placement efforts to reduce overstays. Question #5: Has there been any trends in regards to overstays that County has observed and how have those trends been mitigated? What impact, if any, has COVID-19 had on the rate of overstays? The pandemic greatly affected all of our efforts towards reducing our reliance on the Assessment Center. It was difficult to recruit homes for our older youth and teens, as families were concerned for their own health and survival and did not have the capacity to care for foster youth. The County experienced a decrease in available placements, long facility waiting lists, longer STRTP intake process including an excessive amount of paperwork prior to placement, required medical clearances with COVID testing, no transportation support, technology limitations around educational and mental health supports, which led to placement disruptions. All of this contributed to an increase in the census at the AC and an increase in overstays. However, in review of the 2021 overstay reports what stood out was the majority of overstays were repeat clients, aged 13-17, requiring STRTP level of care, that have been described throughout this report. Several placement practice adjustments have been put in place to address this issue, however without more support from CDSS to hold STRTP's accountable, this will remain outside of our area of influence. Partnership Question #6: In what ways can the CDSS support the County to best meet the needs of children who are experiencing overstays? More available family based beds are needed- It would be a great support for CDSS to include the expectation of recruiting more homes. *CCL has clarified that we do not recruit homes* Technical Assistance (TA)- TA options to help clients find placements that were given 14 days notice. The County will notify their LPA when STRTPs are not responding after 5 days of a referral being submitted More oversight of STRTP's- CCL will let facilities know to contact their assigned LPA if Guardian was not working, finding placements for clients, collaborate between the county and STRTP's to ensure smooth transition for clients. Facilities in compliance with the 14-day notice removal of policy- Not following 14-day notice policies leave our County without the benefit of time to locate a new STRTP that can meet our youth's housing and therapeutic needs. Youth often return to the AC and often overstay while a new placement is located. Next Steps: Question #7: The CDSS recently extended the license for three months and will review for additional extensions every three months. What activities does the County plan to perform to reduce the need for/use of the Receiving Center for the next quarter? The County is in the process of contacting our Inactive RFA homes to support them in reinstating their RFA approval and resume accepting placements. The County has approximately Inactive homes on our list. These cases are being assigned to RFA Child Welfare Workers to re-engage the caregivers. AC is hoping approve at least one-third of the homes to care for older youth. Time frame: TBD. Engaged the family that are on the inactive applicants. Majority of the homes are for smaller kids. Certification, homes reassessed. Some cases are moving through really quickly and some might take time. Question #8: What is the County's plan in the event the license does not get extended at any quarterly review? The County's plan is to work towards our identified closure in September 2023. The County would work with CDSS to develop a transition plan, as it would be important to provide notice to those in the community who greatly depend on the AC for support and care of children/youth. The AC is a huge support to the community, Law enforcement, Probation, Hospitals, and other Child Welfare Jurisdictions to provide trauma informed care for children until placement is found. The County would hope that consideration is given to where children and youth will go if the AC is no longer in operation and to work with the County to facilitate the transition of care. This concluded CCL's Annual Review of the Alameda County Assessment Center. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Mia Bucker-Preston with read receipt. Administrator Bucker-Preston will sign all documents and return to LPA Ng over email.",

Back in April of last year, it was discussed that County's plan is to work towards their identified closure in September 2023. The County stated that if they decide to move forward with the extension, they anticipate on issuing a letter within the next 30 days stating why they need the extension, their transition plan, and what barriers they are currently facing. A solution that was discussed was to relocate out of Hayward and look for an alternative space. CCL stated that the license is not transferable and would need to submit a new application. CCL also stated that the County would need to prepare with the current Operating Standards (OS) and update their Program Statement to reflect the OS. CCL pointed out the Operating Standard is stating that all employees shall be fingerprint cleared and files will need to be accessible and that Alameda County would need to confer with their legal department regarding the new OS. Nothing was agreed upon, just discussed during this meeting. (Continued on Lic809-c) County introduced the idea of separating youth based on the age groups due to a concern regarding the connection that can occur between older youth with high level behavior and younger youth. CCL discussed the issue with sibling sets. Also, the County discussed the hardships between providers and not having enough placement's for youth resulting in Overstays. The providers are not accepting youth due to a variety of reasons. Some reasons discussed were that the staff in the facilities are not equipped with the proper training and that the behaviors have escalated. The County explained that the reason for the escalated behaviors can be from not seeking mental health treatments during COVID or youth just not having enough resources on hand. This concluded the discussion with Alameda County Assessment Center. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Mia Bucker-Preston with read receipt.

The purpose of the inspection was to conduct interviews, discuss background clearances, reporting requirements, and technical support services (TSP). During the inspection, LPA Ng and LPM Flynn interviewed three staff and two clients. One client declined. Based on the review of the Guardian roster, staff who work directly with the clients, do not have criminal record background clearances through the Department of Social Services. LPA found that the AC is sending in incident reports that are incomplete. For example, what techniques staff used to redirect a client prior to an unauthorized absence (AWOL) were not included in incident reports. Further, incident reports for an unauthorized absence also did not include police report numbers. LPA Ng discussed the incident report documents (LIC624 and LIC624LE). LPA informed the Administrator that the facility can use their own forms if they contain all the required information. Administrator Mia Buckner-Preston responded to LPA and said they have \"updated the Runaway Incident form and will begin using the form when they start the electronic Runaway Notification process with Hayward PD.

    "narrative": "**Amended 2/8/2024 - remove confidential identifiers** On August 1, 2023 at 10: AM, Community Care Licensing (CCL) representatives met with the facility above over Microsoft Teams for the purpose of conducting an Annual Review of the facility's program, needs, population, and overstay logs. In attendance in this meeting were:: -CCL Regional Manager (Regional Manager) Nelson Martinez -Licensing Program Manager (Licensing Program Manager) Carolyn Flynn -Alicia Bernstein (Provider Policy Implementation Unit, Manager - Policy an Technical Assistance Bureau - Systems of Care Branch) -Adele Carlson (Associate Government Program Analyst - Child Protection Policy Unit) -Julie Waters (Child Protection Policy Unit Manager) - Mia Buckner-Preston (Administrator) -Michelle Love (Alameda County SSA-CWS Child Welfare Director) -Melissa Fegurgur (Program Manager) The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Alameda County Assessment Center Annual Review. Michelle provided an update on the issues between the city of Hayward and the Assessment center and that they are continuing to locate an new location. In the meantime they will be reclaiming more space at their current location so there will be a separate space for the younger youth. At the last Annual Meeting with the County, the County shared they had implemented new strategies to help build capacity in home-based care and STRTPs. \u2022 What activities has the County implemented that have increased capacity in home-based care and in STRTPs? (Cont. Lic809c) \u00b7What outreach and/or strategies have been used in 2022 to increase capacity in home-based care and in STRTPs? \u00b7 How effective have these efforts been in increasing capacity in home-based care and in STRTPs respectfully? The County continues to employ the ongoing capacity increasing strategies as described in the previous annual report. This past year the county added three new county Resource Family Approval (RFA) homes that accept teens. Also, this past year, the county launched the Emergency RFA Teen Homes campaign to increase the number of emergency home based placements available for youth and teens over the age of 13 years. From this effort the county has 4 interested caregivers that we will be working with over the next few months Caregivers that accept teens on an emergency basis will receive a $250 gift card as a sign-up bonus, additional funding up to $3500 in addition to the foster care funding, and placement stabilization, preservation, and training from Misssey and Side-by-Side and therapeutic services offered by West Coast Children's Clinic. In addition, the county will be extending the contract with our Wraparound Services provider to help support the expansion of the current services and staffing. The County, in partnership with Behavioral Health Care Services, developed a contract with Alternative Family Services Foster Family Agency to recruit additional ISFC homes with the ability to provide TFC services. There are currently 4 trained ISFC/TFC homes that can care for teens. The county, provider, and BHC meet on a monthly basis to review vacancies, discuss recruitment efforts and strategies, and identify needed supports. The County continues to contract with REFUGE STRTP for preferred placement STRTP beds. The county increased the funding so the provider has access to funding to increase staffing support when needed to help preserve and stabilize placement. The contract is for eight (8) beds. This support has decreased the number of 14-day removal notices from the facility. The County finalized the emergency bed contract with Lighthouse Mentoring Center STRTP. The contract is for four (4) male teen beds. Placement in the emergency beds reducing the amount of time the youth is at the AC, allows for some youth to bypass the AC, and allows additional time needed for an appropriate, long-term placement to be located. (cont. Lic809c) All previously identified efforts to build capacity are ongoing. We have found that there are many families and providers that are willing to care for younger children and babies and that few are willing to open their homes to teens. The largest number of clients at the AC are older youth and teens ages 13-17 years old and this population of youth are ones who rely on the AC the most and tend to overstay while placement efforts are being made. Despite all of our best efforts we have been unable to adequately increase the number of homes needed for all the youth who need them. It is difficult to get providers to consider the positive aspects of a teen and give them a chance. Due to the growing needs of our youth, providers feel they are placing themselves and their families in harmful situations and anticipate that the youth will develop problems they are ill-equipped to handle. \u00b7 Has the County been more successful at building capacity for some foster youth populations over others? If so, please identify the populations for which the county has greater challenges. \u00a8 By how much has the county's capacity increased or decreased in 2022? \u2022 What efforts has the County made in reducing the use of the Assessment Center? o Have these efforts been effective in reducing the use of the Assessment Center? Why or why not? The County continues to make every effort to meet the needs of all the youth receiving services at the AC and works diligently to reduce the number of overstays and for the majority of our children, youth, and Nonminor Dependents placement is found within the 72 hour timeframe. The County has been successful in building capacity in the home-based placement options for youth under the age of 12 years, but increasing the number of home-based options for our older youth and teens continues to be a work in progress and at this time there are not enough homes to meet the placement needs of the youth at the AC and we have not seen the success we hoped for in reducing the use of the AC for this age group. The County continues to utilize all strategies previously identified to reduce reliance on the AC especially for our largest client population, youth ages 13-17 years old. However, due to the length of time needed to approve some RFA placements, arrange transportation, schedule and complete medical appointments to address health, mental health, and medication needs, lack of available home-based placements, and length of time needed to complete the STRTP intake process there will be children and youth that will need the services provided by the AC and will remain beyond the 72 hour timeframe despite all efforts to secure timely placements. (Cont, LIC809C) Our strategies include: \u00b7 Exploring all possible placement options before accepting a child/youth at the AC, which includes arranging pre-placement visits family and potential caregivers. \u00b7 Bypassing intake at the AC if the child is already in the home of a relative willing to accept placement. \u00b7 Review of the child's file and placement history, including all family finding efforts \u00b7 Conducting 48 hour huddles to review placement efforts, explore possible options, and provide support and services to secure placement \u00b7 Provide Support services, which include transportation assistance to placements, taking youth to Medical Clearances and obtaining medication needed prior to placement, requesting funding and gift cards for items needed, including furniture, clothing, food, hygiene and hair supplies. \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with updated Emergency RFA placement timeframes that ensures placement occurs within 72 hours of the child arriving at the AC. \u00b7 Daily In-person meetings with youth at the AC to engage them in their placement plan and support them during CFTs, placement interviews and preparing them to leave the AC and transition to the new placement. \u00b7 Participation in Child and Family Team meetings (CFT) to identify placements and supports. \u00b7 Contact and Encourage STRTPs to provide a response regarding acceptance of placement and assist in completing the STRTP Intake packets. \u00b7 Offering additional funding to STRTP providers for 1:1 staffing support and single-room occupancy. \u00b7 Utilization the Catalyst Center and Youth Resource Workgroup \u00b7 Participation in the Family Network of Support meetings for difficult to place youth to identify who can do what to preserve and stabilize a youth's placement \u00b7 Participate in CDSS Technical Assistance calls for challenging to place youth/youth with special medical and/or complex needs. \u2022 The County has communicated that they do not foresee closing the Assessment Center in September of 2023. When does the County foresee no longer needing the Receiving Center? The County does not have an identified date by which we can anticipate no longer needing the Assessment Center. The County does not have enough emergency home-based or STRTP placements available for the (Cont. Lic809c) youth who require out-of-home placement. There are youth who providers will not accept for placement and who have no other safe, caring adults in their lives that are willing to care for them even on a short-term, temporary basis. For those youth, the AC is their only option. At the last Annual Meeting with the County, the County shared they had implemented new strategies to help build capacity in home-based care and STRTPs. \u2022 What activities has the County implemented that have increased capacity in home-based care and in STRTPs? o What outreach and/or strategies have been used in 2022 to increase capacity in home-care and in STRTPs? The County has continued all efforts to increase capacity as identified at the previous Annual Meetings. Our strategies includes the following efforts: o Recruitment website (myresourcefamily.org) o In-person recruitment events and fairs o Ongoing work with our two consultant agencies, Hill and Associates Consulting and Experience Consultants o Participation in the Resource Parent Association meeting o Expansion of the REFUGE STRTP preferred placement contract - 8 beds o Completion of the Emergency/Guaranteed bed contract with Lighthouse Mentoring Center - 4 beds o Development of an ISFC/TFC Contract with Alternative Family Services Foster Family Agency - 4 beds o Daley Solutions recruitment support offered by CDSS o How effective have these efforts been in increasing capacity in home-based care and in STRTPs respectfully? \uf0a7 Has the County been more successful at building capacity for some foster youth populations over others? If so, please identify the populations for which the county has greater challenges. o By how much has the county's capacity increased or decreased in 2022? Increasing home-based capacity has been a challenge, but one that we've come to expect. Providers are (Cont. Lic809c) interested in providing care for youth under the age of 12 years. The County needs homes that will care for older youth and teens ages 13-17 years. Although we were unable to increase capacity enough to eliminate our reliance on the AC we were successful in creating placement options for teens. Our efforts made towards increasing the home-based care has yielded 3 new county RFA homes that accept teens and FFA ISFC homes that accept teens and offer TFC services. The County has increased capacity by seven (7) homes and look forward to increasing that number with our continued efforts. We were also able expand our contract and create a new contract with two (2) STRTP providers that offered 12 beds to our youth. \u2022 What efforts has the County made in reducing the use of the Assessment Center o Have these efforts been effective in reducing the use of the Assessment Center? Why or why not? All of the placement efforts and strategies utilized are in place to locate timely placements, reduce the county's reliance on the AC, and eliminate client overstays. These youth have multiple challenges making locating placement difficult. The majority of the youth have a demonstrated need for a higher level of care and require a STRTP placement. Efforts to place youth in the least restrictive settings have been exhausted and are no longer appropriate to meet the youth's needs. Despite all efforts made the AC continues to be needed to care for children and youth who have no other placement options. (Cont. Lic809c) \u2022 The County has communicated that they do not foresee closing the Assessment Center in September of 2023. When does the County foresee no longer needing the Receiving Center? The county does not have an identified closure date for the Assessment Center. The county plans to submit a letter of extension to continue the AC operations. The county is currently looking for a new location and will be submitting a new application for licensure. Barriers to placement and Overstays: \u2022 In 2021 the County reported 43 youth had repeat overstays, but in 2022 the number increased to103 youth having repeat overstays. What would the County attribute to the significant increase in repeat overstays? o The months having the highest repeat overstays where December 2021 and 2022, March and September 2022. \uf0a7 Why did the County see the highest repeat stays in these months? \uf0a7 Did the county adjust their strategy in preventing/reducing repeat overstays in 2023 as a result of this data? o The most reported barriers to placement were complex care needs, lack of placement, and sibling set. \uf0a7 What steps did the County take to address the above-mentioned barriers while ensuring children were placed in the least restrictive setting that could best meet their needs during 2022? \uf0a7 What is the County doing to ensure that the above-mentioned barriers to placement are addressed going forward? The County is experiencing a return to pre-pandemic operations and as anticipated intakes have been steadily increasing. We tend to have an increase in intakes when children have more access to service providers and when there are school breaks. Intakes tend to increase in September when school resumes and during the months there are school breaks like Christmas and Spring Break. Families tend to travel more during these months and request respite or removal of children and youth in their homes. These also tend to be the months during which caregivers and providers slow down on accepting intakes into their homes and facilities due to vacation and other transitions. During this time we see an increase in youth at the AC and more youth who overstay because there are fewer placement options. (Cont. Lic809c) The county did adjust our strategies for reducing overstays as a result of the data and most months we had success, but at times there were no safe alternatives for youth and their only option was to come to the AC. For those youth we were unable to arrange for visits with family/friends, emergency placements, or transitions from the AC within the 72 hour timeframe. These youth most often had high mental health acuity and behavioral needs, which were greater than what most caregivers and STRTP providers believed they were able to handle. Due to these challenges, older youth and teens overstayed at the AC while efforts to find an appropriate placement continued. As previously mentioned, all of the placement efforts and strategies utilized are in place to locate timely placements in the least restrictive environment able to meet the child and youth's needs. Participation in CFTs have continued and search efforts made to address any placement needs. The chart above reflects the majority of overstays at the AC are youth between the ages of 13-17 with multiple challenges making locating placement difficult. The majority of the youth have a demonstrated need for a higher level of care and require a STRTP placement. Efforts to place youth in the least restrictive settings have been exhausted and that level of care is no longer appropriate to meet the youth's needs. Once a higher level of care is identified all focus becomes locating a STRTP that can address the needs the youth has. However, the goal of placement in the least restrictive environment does not end. Within the next six (6) months of placement the possibility of stepping down to a lower level of care is explored. \uf0a7 Is the county aware of the funding from the 2021-2022 budget that was implemented by the Human Services Omnibus Bill, Assembly Bill 153 (AB 153) to provide counties additional funding to address supports for youth with complex care needs ? \u2022 Is the county pursuing the child specific complex care funds when appropriate, as outlined in ACL 21-119? \u2022 Has the County developed a plan for the capacity building funding also implemented by AB 153 and outlined in ACL 21-143? \u2022 Will these initiatives incorporate supports/services for expanding the options available at the local level for youth without resorting to shelters? \u2022 Is the County aware of the Complex Care Resource Guide 2022? If so, has the County accessed any of the resources (other than the funding from AB 153) addressed in the guide? If not, does the County intend to access any of these resources? (Cont. Lic809c) The County is aware of the funding supports, capacity building opportunities, and the complex care resource guide that are available. The County has every intention on accessing this available supports and will be hiring a Program Specialist that will be responsible for submitting the applications. Although the County has not utilized any AB153 funding that has not prevented us from accessing County Pay funds to arrange for STRTP for 1 and a STRTP for 2 placement options, provide funding for 1:1 and 2:1 staffing supports for youth, and paid for single-room occupancy for youth who required this level of care and support. The county has also provided funding for additional mental health services that were not covered by medi-cal benefits in order to meet our youth's needs and preserve their placements. The County has utilized the following resources to assist with consultation and guidance for placement of hard to place youth: \u00b7 The Family Urgent Response System (FURS) \u00b7 Technical Assistance Calls \u00b7 ASIST/Specialized Permanency Support \u00b7 Catalyst Center \u00b7 Daley Solutions \u2022 In 2022 (December 2021-December 2022), the County reported 156 children overstayed (approximately 18% of the total population), this is a reduction of approximately 10% from the 2021 reported overstays. \uf0a7 What would the county attribute to having 18% of youth entering the shelter resulting in an overstay? \uf0a7 Has the County observed any trends and how have those trends been mitigated? \uf0a7 Of the 156 reported overstays, 88% were reported to be by youth who are 13 years of age or older. How is the County addressing overstays of this critical age group? With the County's focus on reducing the reliance on the AC the youth who are at the AC are the ones who have no other alternatives for safe care. The majority of the intakes are older youth and teens ages 13-17 years old who have multiple co-occurring conditions, frequent awols, CSEC/trafficking, refusal to attend school, participate in mental health treatment or take medication, and have a significant history of placement disruptions. These youth often are more difficult to place and locating and arranging placement often (Cont. Lic809c) exceed the 72-hour timeframe. There are a number of youth in Alameda County that providers are unwilling to work with and these youth linger at the AC while ongoing search efforts continue. Most of the youth in this age group receive multiple removal notices and find themselves returning to the AC more frequently without the benefit of receiving any mental health care. Is the County pursuing any initiatives targeted specifically to build capacity for this age group? The County continues to reach out to STRTP providers on a quarterly basis to partner with them and explore ways to build their capacity and ability to care for more youth. Due to the high cost of living in the Bay Area most providers are unable to purchase additional homes and increase their capacity. However, one STRTP provider is exploring purchasing a new larger home outside of the Bay Area in order to care for teens. The provider is planning to write a proposal for the County's review. Upon review, the County will explore supporting the STRTP using Complex Care/Capacity Building funding. 6 and Under Population: \u2022 By law, a transitional shelter care facility is designed to \"primarily serve[s] children who have previously been placed in a community care facility and are awaiting placement into a different community care facility that is appropriate to their needs. Children residing in transitional shelter care facilities may include children who are very difficult to place in appropriate community care facilities because of factors which may be present in combination, including: threatening, aggressive, suicide, runaway or destructive behaviors and behaviors as defined in Section 5600.3 of theWelfare and Institutions Code (WIC).\" (Health & Saf. Code (HSC) \u00a7 1502.3, subd. (d).) State law discourages the placement of children under age 6 in congregate care facilities as reflected in WIC section 361.2(e) Further, the CDSS recently released guidance addressing the requirements for care of children under age 6 and between ages 6 and 12, and providing reminders of the limitations on use of shelters as placement resources for these populations. ACIN No. I-08-22; REMINDER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CARE OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX AND PLACEMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN IN SHELTER CARE Given the aforementioned, does the County have a plan to eliminate younger children (under six (6) years of age) from entering the Assessment Center? What is the County's plan? (Cont. Lic809c) The County is aware of purpose of the Transitional Shelter Care Facility and the care for young children, specifically ages 0-6 years. The County has done a good job of reducing the reliance on the AC for our younger children. Children under the age of 6 are not able to utilize the AC unless there are no other options for their safe care. Once at the AC, timeframes are closely monitored to ensure that children are transitioned to placement as quickly as children and overstays are the exception. The County also agrees that younger children, should they need to come to the AC, should be separated from older youth. The County is currently creating a new and separate space, which will be able to accommodate the care for children under the age of 12. Youth ages 13 and older will be cared for in a separate space within the facility. Separating the children and youth will allow child care staff to focus on their individual and developmental needs. Partnership \u2022 In what ways can the CDSS support the County to best meet the needs of children who are experiencing overstays? Could the County benefit from any of the resources identified in the Complex Care Resource Guide 2022? The County continues to utilize and benefit from the resources identified in the Complex Care Resource Guide. The County has received support from the Catalyst Center, CCL, and CDSS to help support efforts to locate placement for very hard to place youth. However, for a few of our clients at the AC, despite all of the supports offered by CDSS and the Catalyst Center, placements have not been located and the youth remain at the AC. Last year, the County identified needing support from CDSS to hold STRTPs accountable for accepting youth into their programs when they have vacancies. STRTPs are not under contract with Counties so this leaves Counties with little authority to hold STRTPs accountable for not accepting youth who meet that level of care or submitting notices for removal without providing any services needed to support any changes in the youth's behavior. This past year, we were informed that CDSS did not have the authority to influence\" STRTPs with vacancies to accept placement, even for a short period of time. In addition, the County identified that it would be supportive if CDSS helped to enforce the 14-day notice policy and eliminate the ability for STRTP providers to submit same day or emergency removals. More and more STRTPs are submitting immediate removal notices and returning youth to the AC. This leaves the County (Cont. Lic809c) with very little time to arrange for alternative care and the AC becomes the only immediate option. Without these two needed supports the County will continue to be unable to eliminate the reliance on the AC. Next Steps: \u2022 The CDSS recently extended the license for two additional three-month increments for a total of six months at which time the County has communicated they will be closing in the month of September of 2023. What activities does the County plan to perform to reduce the need for/use of the Assessment Center for the next two quarters and be prepared to close the facility as proposed? o What strategies is the County utilizing to find placement for children currently served by the Assessment Center when it is closed? o What efforts is the County making to recruit more emergency placement homes and/or STRTP options? o What supports are in effect for home-based and STRTP providers that have been determined to be successful in reducing the need to enter into the shelter? o The Assessment's Center's Admissions increased by almost 6% from 2021 to 2022. What would the county attribute to the increase in admissions and what will the county do to reduce the number of admissions in the future? o What is the County's plan to eliminate the need for the Assessment Center? o Please provide details on activities and dates within the next quarter by which the County will perform said activities. The County is not working towards closure of the AC at this time. Children, youth, and Nonminor Dependents continue to require the safe housing, services, and support provided by the Center. The County intends to submit a letter requesting an extension of the TSCF license within the next 30 days. The County is currently searching for a different facility and plans to submit a new program statement and an application for licensure. The location of the new facility is expected to occur within the next three (3) to six (6) months. The County will keep CCL apprised of any location updates. The County continues to work towards reducing the reliance on the AC, however as we return to pre-pandemic operations our intakes at the AC will continue to increase. However, there are several practices in place to help ensure that only the youth who have no other options for care receive services at the AC. Once at the AC, these practices include making daily placement efforts and monitoring timeframes (Cont. Lic809c) to make sure youth are not overstaying and transition from the AC can occur within the 72-hour timeframe. However, the youth who heavily rely on the AC and overstay are our most difficult to place youth. These are youth who struggled prior to the pandemic at home and in school. The pandemic highlighted the challenges youth and their families had accessing services and supports. School-based and community-based mental health programs are still unable to meet the needs of the children and youth we all serve and at times the child welfare system is a family's only hope when they are in crisis. We see these children and youth at the AC and are tasked with finding placement within the 72-hour timeframe. These youth are involved in acts of community violence, frequently awol from the facility, refuse to participate in mental health services or take medication, refuse to attend school, are non-compliant with house and program rules, have little to no tolerance and capacity to deal with disappointment, rejection, sadness that at times lead to threats and assaults on staff, teachers, and peers. Many of the needs our youth have were not served during the pandemic and have only increased. Most providers are unwilling, unable, or not equipped to care for the needs our youth currently have. STRTPs do not offer comprehensive mental health and medication services and often cite that our youth need a \"higher level of care\" when they are deemed to be the highest. When all of this occurs, youth are kicked out of their homes and facilities and are brought to the AC and we are responsible for their care and tasked with finding a home that is able to meet their various needs and handle their behaviors. Although the issue may appear to be an AC or capacity issue, it is actually a societal issue, one that most counties are dealing with. Until counties and the state can collectively work together to identify or create additional placement options, the services of the AC will continue to be needed because it is the only housing option some of our youth currently have. The County will continue our work with our two consultant agencies, Hill and Associates Consulting and Michael Sanders and the Experience with the goal of increasing the number of home-based resource family placements for our older youth and teens. We will be working with both teams to re-launch the Emergency RFA Campaign - Recruitment is Everybody's Business. The increase in home-based care will benefit youth new to our foster care system that do not require the level of care provided by STRTPs, but will allow teens to grow up in with a family setting, complete school in their communities, and remain engaged with extracurricular and enrichment activities, and continued employment. As previously mentioned, the AC is creating a new and separate space to accommodate the care of children ages 0-12 years old. The new space is expected to be completed within the next 30 days. (Cont. Lic809c) The Assessment Center TSCF continues to be important and necessary for our young people in foster care. There remains a considerable lack of resources throughout our state, not just in Alameda County, and the STRTPs and Behavioral Health Care systems are still rebuilding and finding ways to meet the mental health and behavioral needs of our children and youth. Due to the lack of bed capacity, the very long intake process for placement at a STRTP facility that cannot be completed in 72 hours, lack of mental health and educational services, older youth and teens refusing out-of-county placements, and STRTP facilities refusing to accept placement of youth despite having vacancies, our AC is necessary and important and the need for our services continues to exist. We are fortunate that we have the AC so our children and youth are not left without a place responsible for their care. Alameda County continues to take every opportunity to work with the State to explore all available options for the care and placement of hard to place youth, but at this time there are no viable, long-lasting options. Hard to place youth with co-occurring mental health and behavioral needs see more notices for their removal from facilities designed to meet their needs and their stays at STRTP facilities gets shorter with each new placement. Alameda County continues to work very hard to comply with the directives from CCL and CDSS. We have updated our practices to ensure we are only caring for children, youth, and NMDs who have no other safe choice for their care. We are reducing our reliance on the AC by identifying other safe alternatives for placement and care for children and youth so they do not need to come to the AC. We also working diligently towards eliminating overstays and the monthly overstay reports reflect that we have reduced not only the number of intakes at the AC, but also the length of time the majority of children and youth remain at our facility. This concluded CCL's Annual Review of the Alameda County Assessment Center. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was emailed to Administrator Mia Bucker-Preston with read receipt. Administrator Bucker-Preston will sign all documents and return to LPM Flynn over email",

Four of the thirteen individuals interviewed stated that they had concerns with the de-escalation from the staffed security guards at times, including three that had concerns about the incident on 12/12/2023. Based on confidential interviews, it was alleged that staff members had neglected to use verbal de-escalation, pulled client's clothes when unnecessary, and had used excessive force during physical intervention. Based on review of the security footage from body-worn cameras on 12/12/2023, LPA observed that staff members did not utilize verbal de-escalation with youth. LPA also observed that staff had pulled at client's clothes and had stood closely to clients after clients had asked for space. Based on review of the security footage, the staff members had used curse words and verbal threats towards the clients in care. Based on confidential interviews and review of the security footage, the allegation that facility staff had violated youth's personal rights during a restraint has met the preponderance of doubt and is therefore substantiated.

LPA met with Adam Weiner, Administrator (ADM) at 9: AM on 4/5/24. Due to LPA Simien only being able to interview one person involved in the incident, it was determined that the allegations listed above are unsubstantiated. LPA attempted to contact the other individual involved in the incident via their social worker but as of 4/5/24 has not gotten a response. LPA was able to contact an individual that witnessed the incident, but they declined to be interviewed. The facility attempted to send incident reports (IR) to San Jose Children's Residential Regional Office (RO) but RO didn't receive them due to server issues at the facility. The facility re-sent the IRs when informed of this. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are UNSUBSTANTIATED.

Confidential interviews indicated that facility staff (RM1, RM2, and S1) bribed C1 with money. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 had video recordings of RM1 and other facility staff disclosing clients confidential in front of C1 and other clients. Confidential interviews revealed that RM1, RM2, and S1 did not offer C1 one hundred dollars to review the cell phone recordings. Confidential interviews disclosed that RM1, RM2, and S1 requested that C1 share the cell phone recordings. Confidential interviews revealed that RM1 and RM2 offered a gift card incentive to C1 if C1 was being honest. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 requested one hundred dollars to share the video with RM1, RM2, and S1. Confidential interviews disclosed that C1 had a cell phone video recording of RM1 and other facility staff disclosing client confidentiality in front of C1. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 was unable to share video recordings. LPA could not determine if staff bribed C1, whether C1 asked for a monetary gift to show recordings, or if there were some recordings of staff conversation. The Department also received an allegation that the staff (RM1, RM2, and S1) made false allegations against minors (C1) in care.

    "narrative": "The alleged victim (C1) did not cooperate with the CCL investigation. However, other supporting documentation indicated that an internal investigation regarding the officer's behavior was also conducted. The internal investigation reported that multiple interviews with staff and residents did not provide any statements validating the alleged misconduct. In addition, it was reported that C1 provided inconsistent statements, and there was no recorded evidence to support the allegation. Furthermore, it was reported that C1 later recanted their statement, admitting to making a false allegation due to a personal dislike of the police deputy. This was supported by a confidential interview in which another client disclosed that they had been asked to lie about the deputy's behavior. Based on confidential interviews and records review, the allegation that minors (C1) are being inappropriately touched while in care is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report, the LIC 811, and appeal rights were explained and given to the Regional Manager Heidi Lombardi.",

    "narrative": "On Wednesday 6/2/21 at 10:30AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted an announced prelicensing inspection at the facility site. LPA met with Core Program Supervisor Damian Nomellini and Administrator/Core Program Director Monique Nervis. COVID-19 safety precautions were taken during visit, including screening, sanitizer, disinfectant, and mask-wearing. There are two care staff and one child present. The child was asleep in the large bedroom. At 10:33AM, LPA conducted a tour of the facility and grounds. The facility is a blue, two-story, historical house that has received a fire clearance for 4 ambulatory only youth ages 0-17. The main entrance is on the side near the parking lot. The front entrance opens to the street. LPA observed the street to be a somewhat busy main road. The upstairs consists of the administrator's office, the nurse's office, and the storage room, and the downstairs consists of two double-occupancy bedrooms, the living room, kitchenette, and staff office space, hallway, bathroom with only shower/tub (no toilet) and laundry, and bathroom with no shower or tub (only toilet, sink, changing table). All rooms upstairs are kept locked. The upstairs offices are both clean and tidy, and the nurse's office is stocked with first aid supplies. The first aid kit is centrally stored in the black cabinet in the living room. A sign in sheet and a no contact thermometer are ready for screening upon entry and placed on a table near the main entrance. The locked upstairs storage room is organized and currently holds plenty of school supplies, backpacks, hygiene products, toilet paper, paper towels, and clothing of different sizes and styles to be appropriate for all groups of youth. The client files are kept in a locked cabinet in the storage room. All rooms and areas downstairs are tidy and free of obstruction. Both bedrooms are double-occupancy with single beds fitted with mattress pads. The facility stores a crib under one of the beds in the small bedroom that is to be set up and used as appropriate for admitted youth. Core Program Supervisor stated the crib is usually set up in the living room rather than the large bedroom so that staff can have eyes on the youth at all times. LPA recommends the crib be placed in a bedroom, per OS Section 84087(a)(4)-(5). The facility has plenty of cleaning solutions, detergents, and disinfectants stored in locked cabinets in the shower/laundry room. Bath linens are stored in this room as well. The bathroom with toilet is clean and in sanitary condition. Broom and mop are stored in a closet under the stairs. Craft supplies, toys, and entertainment are available for youth of varying ages. Furniture is sturdy and in good condition. The kitchenette is stocked with utensils and dishware to serve the intended population. There is currently perishable and nonperishable food that is in date and in supply to meet the needs of youth in care. Food items were date labeled. At 10:33AM, LPA observed that the stairs to the upstairs are very steep. Administrator stated that she needs to walk at an angle in order to support herself up the stairs. LPA also had to walk at an angle. The facility has placed gates at the top and bottom that could secure in place but did not have locks. Two signs were posted at the bottom of the stairs: one read \"Children are NOT allowed on the 2nd floor if not accompanied by staff\"; and the second read \"Steep Stairs Use Hand Rail.\" At 10:40AM, LPA observed there to be a small, locked door in the storage room. Administrator and Core Program Supervisor were unable to locate the key to the door and stated they did not know what was behind the door but assumed it was additional storage. At 10:45AM, LPA observed there to be an attic access point in the middle of the upstairs hallway. There is no drop ladder and the door can be opened by pushing up while stepping on a ladder. A ladder was leaning against the wall at the end of the hall. Core Program Supervisor confirmed that there is no lock on the door. At 10:47AM, LPA inspected the balcony access door at the end of the upstairs hallway. There is an alarm on the door but it was observed to not be working. No alarm could be heard from upstairs or downstairs. At 10:49AM, LPA observed an exposed telephone cord poking out of the ceiling in the upstairs hallway. Core Program Supervisor stated he did not know what the purpose of the cord was. LPA recommends concealing the cord. At 10:50AM, LPA inspected the facility grounds and shed in the side yard. The shed is used as extra storage and is kept locked. LPA observed a painter's spatula near the shed and requested Core Program Supervisor remove the item from the yard. At 10:51AM, LPA observed the unused entrance on the left side of the house (facing the street). The porch is sturdy but not otherwise well maintained, as there is a large amount of insects and webbing on the wall, railing, and around the porch light. At 10:55AM, LPA observed there to be a white mattress and bag in the yard. Core Program Supervisor stated it may belong to a homeless individual. The homeless camp set up is on facility grounds. There is no fencing surrounding the lot, but there is a fence surrounding neighboring lots behind the facility. There is no physical barrier between the outdoor activity space on the facility grounds and the main road on which the facility is located. It is a potential concern if unknown individuals frequently camp on the grounds, as this has been observed at previous visits. At 11AM, LPA observed in the smaller bedroom that there is a small flat screen television mounted above the head on the bed nearest the street side of the house. Above the television is a mounted shelf with a DVD player on it. It is a potential concern that this television placement is not the most ideal and may be a hazard. LPA strongly recommends a more suitable location. Core Program Supervisor stated the facility already has plans to move the television to above the dresser so it is viewable from both beds. At 11:10AM, LPA observed that one of the downstairs windows in the living room was broken and boarded up with cardboard and tape inside and wood on the outside. The facility had notified LPA beforehand that this was caused by one of the youth in placement the week prior to the visit. Please review OS Section Buildings and Grounds, Line (a). At 11:14AM, the smoke detectors were tested. LPA requested that the sleeping youth be gently notified a few minutes prior to testing the alarm. LPA was in the upstairs administrator's office and observed that the alarm was fairly faint from the office. LPA stood in the upstairs hallway and noticed it was still faint and that the upstairs alarm was not beeping and appeared to not be synced with the downstairs alarm. Please review OS Section 80045, Line (c)(2)(A) and applicable Health and Safety Code sections related to fire clearances and smoke detectors. LPA recommends ensuring the alarms are synced. At 11:28AM, LPA inspected the first aid kit and observed the first aid manual and tweezers to be missing. At 11:35AM, Core Program Supervisor searched the nurse's office and confirmed the facility did not have a manual or tweezers. Please review OS Section Health-Related Services, Line (f)(1). The following items need to be completed in order for the facility to be granted full licensure. A follow-up virtual inspection will be conducted to verify completion. The follow-up visit is anticipated to be conducted within four weeks from today. 1. Notify LPA once access is obtained to the locked storage space in the upstairs storage room. 2. Notify LPA of the plan to secure the attic access door to ensure it is only accessible to authorized staff. 3. Notify LPA when the alarm on the upstairs balcony access door is in working condition. 4. Notify LPA when the side porch has been cleared of webbing and insects. 5. Notify LPA of plan/statement addressing unknown/unauthorized individuals camping of facility grounds. 6. Notify LPA once the mounted television in the small bedroom has been relocated to above the dresser. 7. Notify LPA once the downstairs window has been repaired. 8. Notify LPA of the plan to see if it is possible to sync the smoke detectors to ensure the alarm can be heard throughout the house. 9. Notify LPA once the first aid kit is complete with the first aid manual and tweezers. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report left with Core Program Supervisor Damian Nomellini and Administrator/Core Program Director Monique Nervis, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "On Thursday 9/16/21 at 9:27AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a visit at the facility for a Post-Licensing Inspection. LPA met with Core Program Supervisor Damian Nomellini and informed of the purpose of the visit. Prior notice of the visit was provided to conduct a screening. Safety precautions were taken including mask-wearing and hand hygiene. There were three staff present, including Core Program Supervisor, and two youth in care. LPA observed the youth to be in good spirits and engaging well with staff. Staff were knowledgeable of facility procedures, reporting requirements, and trauma-informed care practices. LPA toured the facility and observed the site to be clean, in good repair, and free of obstructions and hazards. There are no bodies of water on the premises, and Program Supervisor confirmed there are no firearms. The exterior and entry way of grounds were well-maintained and clear of debris. The entry space has staff desks, and there is a staff office and a nurse's room upstairs. There is also a locked storage room upstairs. Resident records are stored in a file cabinet in the upstairs storage room. Staff files are maintained at the administrative office, but copies are kept on site as well. The first aid kits were stored downstairs and were observed to be complete. License, facility sketch, and personal rights were posted in the facility. Room temperature was comfortable and within permitted range. Hot water in the bathroom was measured to be both too high and too low. Initially and for about a minute, the water temperature reached high temperatures and for at least a second reached as high as F and was steaming. It then lowered and would not go above F, and the water pressure dropped significantly. Core Program Supervisor stated maintenance was working on the sink this morning and they would be called back to resume their work. For now, because the system appears to have malfunctioned rather than to be consistently delivering too hot water, LPA advises, per Operating Standards (OS) Section 80088, that the facility post a sign cautioning of hot water temperatures at the sink and continue monitoring temperatures. The kitchen and living room area was observed to be clean and tidy. The facility keeps clean and appropriate games and activities for all age groups. The kitchen space was sanitary. Chemicals are stored in a locked cabinet in the laundry/shower room. Medications and sharps are stored in a locked cabinet behind the staff desks downstairs. There are two double-occupancy bedrooms. Beds are single beds with clean linens. The facility has extra bed linens in storage. LPA inspected resident records and staff files. Records were complete and contained necessary forms and/or equivalents of required forms. LPA observed the following items and issued advisories per the facility Operating Standards (OS). 1) Files for staff S1, S2, and S3 (See LIC Confidential Names) are missing first aid certificates, LIC Criminal Record Statement, and LIC Statement Acknowledging Requirement to Report Child Abuse. LPA advises, per OS Section 80066(a) Personnel Records, that all staff files are updated to include current forms and certificates and be made available at the facility site. 2) Staff health screenings and TB tests are not maintained at the facility site. Also, the staff training record maintained on site does not include training record for all staff, and staff files do not contain training records. LPA advises, per OS Section 80066(e) Personnel Records, that the facility ensure that these records are available on site. 3) File for resident R1 (See LIC 811) has a medication administration record that does not reflect medication was administered on resident's first day in care. This is due to the facility not receiving the resident's medication until the following day. LPA advises as technical assistance that the facility note on the log why medication was not administered on any day medications are not administered for R1 and future youth. The facility has otherwise maintained compliance with applicable licensing requirements during the provisional licensure period. There are no pending items for the licensee to complete in order for the facility to qualify for full transitional shelter care facility licensure. The regular, non-provisional license will be generated and provided to the facility. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left with Core Program Supervisor Damian Nomellini, whose signature on this form confirms receipt.",

County representatives discussed the actions that Contra Costa County has taken to lower overstays at the receiving centers, including working with Dept. of Behavioral Health, supporting existing STRTPs and resource family homes, increasing relative placements, focusing on Intensive Services Foster Care (ISFC) homes, and contracting with a company that does extra family searching for relative placements. Continued on LIC809C... County representatives relayed that they have conducted outreach in the community for more placements. According to the representatives, this has included reaching out to other counties, current providers, and currently certified homes. Aspiranet representatives discussed that a youth would not be accepted in the facility if there was a consistency of not being able to provide services to the specific youth; however, youth with no history will typically be accepted into placement. Aspiranet representatives relayed that a youth would not be accepted if there was an inability to safely maintain the youth, but there is an option to accommodate these youth depending on the current status of the two homes. The meeting adjourned at 2:28PM.",

    "narrative": "On Friday, November 6, 2020, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins and Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Helga Wong made an announced visit for a scheduled Prelicensing inspection. LPA and LPM met with Aspiranet Executive Director Vernon Brown and Division Director Mickie Allen. Aspiranet has submitted an application for a transitional shelter care facility license for a capacity of 6 ambulatory children ages 0-17. There are currently no children in care, and care staff need to be hired. LPA and LPM conducted a walk-through of the facility. The facility is a one-story, tan house in a suburban residential neighborhood. The house and grounds are in good repair, free of mess, and free of obstructions. There are no bodies of water and no firearms or ammunition on the premises. It will be staff policy to not bring any firearms or ammunition to the facility. Knives and sharps are stored in two locked drawers in the kitchen. The lock will be kept on staff's person. Chemicals, cleaning solutions, and laundry detergents will be stored in the locked cabinet under the sink. Medications will be stored in a locked drawer in the staff office. The facility will have a refrigerator lockbox for medications that require refrigeration. There are utensils to meet the needs of 6 youth. There is a front play space for young children in the front of the house and another lounge space for older youth in the back of the house. The facility will have a menu posted on the refrigerator. The facility has signs ready to be put up that cover house rules, activities, diaper changing, and crib safety. The license, facility sketch, and the emergency plan will be posted high on the wall in the front of the house. There are three bedrooms. Two rooms are double-occupancy with single beds, and one room will be for two children but can sleep three in two single beds and one crib. The facility intends to only sleep three in this room if the youth are siblings. All beds have mattress pads. There is one bathroom near the bedrooms, and one bathroom off of the staff office. Facility files and personnel files will be kept in the staff office. Staff keys will be kept on their person; personal keys and car keys can be stored in the locked staff drawer. Children's files will be kept in locked cabinets in the administrative intake room at the front of the house. First aid kit was observed to be complete and stored in the administrative intake room. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were tested and are functioning properly. The fire extinguisher was present and up to code. The fire place is non-operational with a plastic plant on display. The garage will be used for staff vehicles and for storage of extra supplies for youth, including clothing for youth who arrive with too few or ill-fitting items. The facility does not have a facility vehicle. The transportation procedures for youth were discussed, including social workers transporting youth, staff license and vehicle inspection procedure, and car seats for young children. There are alarms on all exterior doors and windows. The backyard has a grassy area, a deck, and gravel paths on the sides of the house. There is a chain fence on the back of the yard, which opens to a downward sloped hill. There are a few gaps under the fence that staff will watch to ensure they don't become large enough to allow a youth to climb under. The air conditioning was observed to be functioning, and room temperature was within permitted range. Water temperature was measured at the kitchen sink and the hallway bathroom sink. Both measures were under the permitted range, as the gas had been turned off, and the pilot light is off, so there is no hot water. During visit, a maintenance worker was called, arrived, was screened at entry, and turned on the gas. At 12:30PM, the water temperatures were retested and measured within in range at 108. F at the kitchen sink and 110. F at the bathroom sink. There is a drop-ladder to the attic in the hallway. It can be pulled down by a tab. A safety plan will be developed for the use of this space or way to secure the latch to ensure it is inaccessible to youth in care. When the plan is developed, a statement about the plan will be sent to LPA Hawkins, and a meeting will be set with LPA Hawkins to view any alterations to the latch. The physical plant requirements have been met. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report left with Vernon Brown and Mickie Allen. Vernon Brown's signature on this form confirms receipt.",

    "narrative": "On 12/04/2020 at 12:20PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins met with Core Program Director Monique Perry Nervis for a follow-up visit to review the secured attic access door. This visit was scheduled with Monique and Core Division Director Mickie Allen and was conducted as a televisit over FaceTime due to COVID-19 pandemic safety orders. On 11/06/2020, an initial prelicensing inspection was conducted, which determined that the physical plant requirements had been met. Today's visit is only to view the secured attic access door discussed during that visit. At the initial inspection, staff stated that, once locked, the attic access will remain locked and only accessible to staff. The attic can be used as storage. Children/clients will not be allowed in the attic space. Prior to today's visit, photos of the lock securing the door were provided to LPA. During the visit, staff demonstrated that the lock and door were secure by pulling on the latch. Staff also demonstrated how to unlock the lock. LPA observed the lock and door to be very secure. The site status as ready for licensure is unchanged. Physical plant requirements have been met. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was sent to Core Division Director Mickie Allen and Core Program Director Monique Perry Nervis, who agreed to sign the copy of this report emailed by LPA and return to LPA a signed copy signifying receipt.",

    "narrative": "On Monday 05/10/21 at 1:30PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Mariah Hawkins conducted a visit at the facility for a Post-Licensing Inspection. LPA met with Program Director Monique Nervis and informed her of the purpose of the visit. As a COVID-19 safety precaution, this visit was conducted as a televisit over FaceTime. There were three staff present, including Program Director, and one youth in placement. The youth was sleeping in Bedroom 3. LPA toured the interior and exterior of the facility and observed the site to be clean, in good repair, and free of obstructions and hazards. There are no bodies of water on the premises, and Program Director confirmed there are no firearms. The backyard was well-maintained and clear of debris or hazards. The staff office has staff desks, an attached bathroom (staff bathroom but is also used for youth who need additional support, such as those with lice), and a closet used as a file room. Client files are stored in locked cabinets in the file room. Medications are stored in a locked cabinet in the file room. Medication administration logs are kept with the medication, as well as administration instructions, and copies of the logs are stored in client files. Facility does not currently have youth with medications, but Program Director confirmed that medications are to be separated by client. The right from room is the admin area where intakes are done. The first aid kids were stored in this room, and the license was posted here. The living area consists of two lounge spaces, one suitable for all ages and one tailored to younger children. The kitchen and dining spaces are clean. The refrigerator is full of food, such as eggs, juice, milk, and yogurt, and the freezer contained waffles and sausages. Thermometers are kept inside to monitor the temperatures, which were in the required ranges. Pantry was also inspected. The menu is posted on the wall in the hallway next to the office. The facility sketch, emergency plan, personal rights, and foster youth rights were also posted here. Laundry chemicals and cleaning supplies are stored in the locked cabinet under the kitchen sink and in locked cabinets in the garage. Knives are inaccessible. There are three youth bedrooms and one youth bathroom. The bedrooms are double occupancy with single beds, except for Bedroom 1, which also has a crib and changing table, as approved by CCL. Beds have mattress pads and linens. Extra linens are stored in the upper shelving of the closet. Youth was sleeping in Bedroom 3, so this room was not closely inspected. The bathroom is clean and tidy. A few bathroom cleaners are stored in a locked cabinet under the bathroom sink. All locked cabinets can be opened by a magnet key only accessible to staff. The attic access latch is locked with a physical lock, the key to which is only accessible to staff. The facility has maintained compliance with all applicable licensing requirements during the provisional licensure period. There are no pending items for the licensee to complete in order for the facility to qualify for standard transitional shelter care facility licensure. Licensee will be notified and sent a copy once the license is ready. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was left with Program Director Monique Nervis, who agreed to receive the report by email and return to LPA a signed copy.",

During an investigation at the facility, LPA observed that an incident report for an incident on 12/05/21 did not match the shift notes describing the incident on that day. Per the submitted incident report, the youth left on an unauthorized absence because the youth wanted to go to the park and had asked staff to take the youth but no staff were available at that time. However, the shift notes indicate there was a longer, escalated event in which the youth was upset about television time and the need to take turns with other youth in care. This incident required multiple staff to engage with the youth to attempt to de-escalate the youth. Then, the youth left. However, staff statements of the incident were consistent and indicate, along with the shift notes, that staff followed program procedures to attempt de-escalation and prevent unauthorized absence. The tmie of the unauthorized absence matches, as well. Additionally, the facility has not shown a trend of missing information in incident reports or not following reporting requirements. LPA advises the facility, per Operating Standards (OS) Section Reporting Requirements, that incident reports should include a detailed narrative of the incident and events leading up to the incident. See LIC 9102, dated 6/17/22.

County representatives discussed the actions that Contra Costa County has taken to lower overstays at the receiving centers, including working with Dept. of Behavioral Health, supporting existing STRTPs and resource family homes, increasing relative placements, focusing on Intensive Services Foster Care (ISFC) homes, and contracting with a company that does extra family searching for relative placements. Continued on LIC809C... County representatives relayed that they have conducted outreach in the community for more placements. According to the representatives, this has included reaching out to other counties, current providers, and currently certified homes. Aspiranet representatives discussed that a youth would not be accepted in the facility if there was a consistency of not being able to provide services to the specific youth; however, youth with no history will typically be accepted into placement. Aspiranet representatives relayed that a youth would not be accepted if there was an inability to safely maintain the youth, but there is an option to accommodate these youth depending on the current status of the two homes. The meeting adjourned at 2:28PM.",

During the meeting the following was discussed: Application and Supporting Documents, Plan of Operation, Program Statement, Core Services and Supports. County representatives were also reminded that all pages in the entire Program Statement should be numbered and all corrections and/or revisions highlighted for ease of reference during the review. After review of the Plan of Operation/ Program Statement LPA Carmen Escobar and CDSS Analyst Adele Gray observed the following: Section B: Supportive Documents Page 4: \u00b7 Where will staff and volunteer files be kept? How will they be made available for review by CCL (and other departments)? Supportive documents for each position should include: college transcripts, copy of degrees, certifications, work experience, referrals, etc. (staff files). Section B3: Verification of Social Worker Qualifications Page 5: \u00b7 What specific training will staff receive as the needs of children in can vary. \u00b7Please also include information regarding \"on call staff\" who might be needed in case of emergency and/or ratio requirements. \u00b7 Verify number of annual training hours. Page 6: \u00b7 Expected? Should be minimum of 2 staff and plan for on call staff in case of emergency (re: one staff has to take youth to emergency room, etc.) \u00b7 Please also include information regarding \"on call staff\" who might be needed in case of emergency and/or ratio requirements. Also, address whether or not volunteers will be considered in staff/child ratios. Section B4: Job Description-each position Page 7: \u00b7 Are these attached (staff classification statements)? Section B6: In-Service Training for Staff Page 8: \u00b7 What specific trainings are required for each job classification for the facility? Does training plan specify any job shadowing? How will it be determined staff are competent/adequately trained? Per regulations: \u00b7 A maximum of 4 hours of the training requirement may be satisfied by successful completion of job shadowing. \u00b7 Successful completion of job shadowing shall be verified by a statement completed by the experienced facility personnel being shadowed affirming: a) specific activity observed; b) dates and times of shadowing; and, c) training topic listed in Section 87065.1(c)(3)(A) through (X) that is satisfied by the job shadowing activity. Page 13: \u00b7 Please address how employees will be shadowed, or for how long (per regulations) and how they are assessed as being competent for facility positions. Page 14: \u00b7 Training plan is very detailed, including different departments and such. Is this considered \"community resources\"/using \"outside trainers\" in terms of your training plan? \u00b7 Provide information as to where training hours are kept, how departments like CCL would be able to request training logs, etc. for review/verification. Section B7: Facility Program Description Page 14: \u00b7 What about child's strengths (assessments)? \u00b7 Is this also considered part of the \"primary purpose of program\"? Section 3 offers different primary purpose, perhaps combine the two? Page 15: \u00b7 Within what timeframe (in reference to appropriate placement resources being identified)? \u00b7 What is the actual protocol for crisis intervention at the facility? \u00b7 Trained in trauma informed practices, is this separate from the training plan provided on pages 8-11? Page 16: \u00b7 Will staff be doing the visitation? If so, this would change staff ratios at certain times and would need to have more people staffed. \u00b7 What would a typical daily schedule look like? How would transitions be done though a trauma informed lens to decrease escalation of clients? Also, planning activities should be through a trauma informed lens as some activities can be triggers for youth. Section B8: Rules of Discipline/Personal Rights Page 18: \u00b7 What is plan if youth becomes assaultive and staff cannot de-escalate? Section B9: Admission Policies Page 19: \u00b7 Where will client files be kept? Centrally stored/locked? Available for review? Section B10: Sample Menu Page 20: \u00b7 What is offered if they do not like that meal or have dietary restrictions? \u00b7 Describe provisions available for children with special dietary needs. \u00b7 Portion size (1/2 cup, 1 cup, etc) should be included in menus. Section B11: Control of Property Page 21: \u00b7 Mention documentation of such incidents (LE incidents/SIR incidents). \u00b7 Law enforcement should not need to be contacted for disposal of E-cigarette (for example). Please specify protocol further. Page 22: \u00b7 Are neighbors being made aware of this new facility? Will staff be going door to door? Complaint procedure, grievance procedure for neighbors should also be made available (contact, email, phone number, etc.) PART I PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION SECTION Page 25: \u00b7 No mention of whether or not the facility operates other activities other than the TSCFs. PART II PROGRAM POPULATION, SERVICES, & CAPABILITIES SECTION Page 26: \u00b7 Statement regarding the types of children to be served does not mention dependent, neglected, delinquent, pre-delinquent, physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, mentally disordered, or emotionally disturbed children. \u00b7 What will the volunteers be doing at the facility? \u00b7 Mention the policy regarding volunteers being alone with clients or providing care or supervision to clients.

    "narrative": "On February 16, 2023, Community Care Licensing met with several San Bernardino County agencies, via Microsoft Teams, to discuss the review of the San Bernardino County Transitional Shelter Plan of Operations and Program Statement edits and revisions submitted to Community Care Licensing on November 14, 2022. Children's Residential Program Licensing Regional Manager, LaCresha Cook, Licensing Program Managers, Jennifer Smith and Natasha Dunlap, Licensing Program Analysts (LPAs) Carmen Escobar and Darlene Oseguera and Larry Fluharty, California Foster Care Ombudsperson met with Rosie Mayzum, Children and Family Services (CFS), CFS Supervisor, Eric Raley, Probation Division Director II and Amber McChristian, Social Service Practitioner. During the meeting the following was discussed: revisions to Application and Supporting Documents, Plan of Operation, Program Statement, Core Services and Supports. The opportunity for questions about the revisions was provided to facility representatives with a summarized review of revisions. The following is a summary of the review of the revisions to the Plan of Operation/ Program Statement completed by LPA Carmen Escobar, Systems of Care (SOC) Policy Analyst Gina Jones, and California Foster Care Ombudsperson, Larry Fluharty. Ombudsperson Review and Feedback: - Training on Foster Youth: mandatory training on Foster Youth Rights would go long way toward reducing Rights violations -The social worker must use the materials developed by the OFCO to provide the child their written copy of their rights, WIC \u00a716164(e) -The rights below do not reflect the current 41 rights as updated by AB175(2019) and AB1735 (2022) -It is suggested to abandon use of archaic military term, AWOL. It is recommended to use Absent from Placement without Permission, or something similar. -Is there a separate designation for children who are believed or known to have been abducted? -How is exploitation determined? -It is recommended to add the child's parents, tribe, tribal social worker for children with tribal affiliation, attorney, juvenile court judge if court involved. -Specify how an NMD can be AWOL/ Absent from Placement without Permission. -Is there separate direction on what to do for a youth returning from a period of absence without permission? Does it matter the length of absence 10 mins, 2hrs., 2 days? -This is an overly broad statement and inconsistent with law: CFS is authorized to attain any medically necessary medical services..... -This does not account for religious and culturally necessary diets. -Overall this section does well at protect the youths rights but needs revision to comply with the U.S. and California Constitutions and the Foster Youth Bill of Rights. -Youth are entitled to possession of their own property as well as safe storage for their belonging. This can create some friction. In addition, youth are entitled to as safe home. This would include an environment free of drugs, alcohol and weapons. Obviously, it is a challenge to address all of those competing interests. -The youth should not have any burden to sign that they did not consent. It makes more sense to require a signature if the youth did consent. -There needs to be some better description of the accounting for these items and the consequences for the youth in admitting possession, which could constitute a crime or have other consequence for the youth if documented in case materials. -Is this saying that only LE would conduct searches of youth? I see some value to that but also some problems. -This needs to be better developed to address the youth's right to groom consistent different needs for hair care and skin care based on their culture, ethnicity, gender identity and expression and tribal social and cultural standards. -This should spell out more specifically what is implied that youth 12 and over have a right to choose their own provider and seek health and mental health care including reproductive health without the knowledge of their caregivers or parents. -As stated above, this form needs to reflect that the youth receives OFCO created materials. -Signature should be for consent not refusal. -Notes on exit log: This could be better developed to include the voice of the youth in this significant transition. The current language is not youth focused or trauma informed. -When child is moved, should you notify the tribe, the court, the parents, the attorney, education rights holder, and CFT? -Visitation orders: This is as drafted is inconsistent with law including but not limited to the ICWA and \u00a716001.9. The child is entitled to unsupervised contact by phone mail, video chat unless prohibited by court order. There should be no approved contact list, only unapproved contact which is based upon court order. If there is no court case it should be based upon safety criteria which should be explicitly spelled out. -Activities not allowed: Dating other youth in placement not being allowed. This is a violation of Foster Youth Rights. -The social worker must use the materials developed by the OFCO to provide the child their written copy of their rights, WIC \u00a716164(e) -Personal rights listed: The rights below are not current. WIC 16001.9 was updated in 2019 and 2022 (AB175 (2019) and AB1735 (2022)). -It is suggested to use, Absent from Placement without Permission, instead of AWOL. -Is there a separate designation for children who are believed or known to have been abducted? -Who AWOLs are reported to: it is suggested adding the child's parents, tribe, tribal social worker for children with tribal affiliation, attorney, juvenile court judge if court involved. -Daily log keeping track of children who have run away from their last placement-- it is recommended to expand on how this is a valid data point. -This section is confusing. It needs to distinguish between Title 22 regulation grievances, OFCO complaints and complaints to the SBC Ombudsman. -Publications PUB 339 and 396 cannot be located. Suggested reference to DSS ACLs. ACL21-69 and ACL 22-34 as these are most pertinent. -Youth are entitled to possession of their own property as well as safe storage for their belonging. This can create some friction. In addition, youth are entitled to as safe home. This would include an environment free of drugs, alcohol and weapons. Obviously, it is a challenge to address all of those competing interests -CFS 222: The youth should not have any burden to sign that they did not consent. It makes more sense to require a signature if the youth did consent. -Youth are entitled to an allowance regardless of placement status. Some youth will be in the shelter longer than 72 hours. They will be there weeks and possibly months. There needs to be a method for the youth to receive an allowance in the event of an overstay for longer than a week. -This section should address culturally appropriate clothing, accessories and jewelry. -This section should address religious and culturally appropriate food choices. -The youth are entitled to an allowance. There needs to be a better solutions that what is described here (as addressed above). -Having property \"locked up\"/\"secured\" is a violation of FYBOR to have. -CFS222: The youth should not have any burden to sign that they did not consent. It makes more sense to require a signature if the youth did consent. -Youth purchasing items with own funds: This sentence will result in violations of foster youth rights. Youth should be provided hygiene products of all types which meet the youths needs, for examples the program cannot provide one brand of tampons or soap as that brand may not fit well or cause irritation. This is a matter need and not simply personal choice. SOC Review and Feedback: -What information shall the facility request and use to determine the compatibility for the shelter placement for that individual youth? -In version 2, although this information on screening and assessments was clarified in section B7 facility program description (bottom of pg 18) it also needs clarification in Part II program narrative A. Program description (pg 41). The difference between screening and assessments and who gets them, why, when, by whom is unclear. Do site supervisors and social service practitioners (SSPs) do both screenings and assessments? Or does the social worker II and social service aide do the screenings (the word interviews is used in their job description)? Are mental health assessments done by clinicians from DBH only (pg 18)? Are these clinicians separate from staff listed in section B4- job description? Also in client medical assessments - section 6 (pg 45), do all youth get medical assessments? Or is there a two step process involved with first a screening and then assessments? Please clarify. What is the time frame? Who does them? Please also clarify who does the screenings in section B Job Description (it currently discusses the site supervisor and Social service practitioners do assessments and the SWII and social service aides- do interviews if interviews include screenings please clarify) -(Do not see this documentation information in the second version- it could be added to B9, creating a client file- screening and assessments are documented in the case plan and kept in the client file) -Don't see information below in version 2 of admission/intake section: This information should be in addition to the separation room discussed on page 70 - as that is discussed as a room for youth who are escalating. What is the plan to separate children when assessments or other circumstances warrant that separation? Will there be increased staffing? Will the separation room discussed on page 70 include sleeping and housing the youth if needed? Please clarify. How many separation rooms are there? How many youth does this hold? What if you have more than 1? Also what considerations or briefings for staff shall occur to support a less restrictive response to an elevated issue/behavior, should one occur in the future? -Missing this information. Pg 19 you discuss assessments to determine if an STRTP is needed but stop there. What is the communication plan/protocol for when a Qualified Individual (QI) assessment referral from the county may seems necessary due to the elevated nature of youths needs? Do you establish relationships with STRTPs in or out of your area- so they know you may be contacting them? If a youth needs an STRTP level of care how do you ensure other youth are safe in the facility while you are searching for placement? -Missing information: Would like to see a timeline and a list of activities for each day from referral to placement. Is this a timeline on Page 90 (under the organizational chart)? If so, please label as Timeline from Referral to Placement. Is it possible to categorize by day? CCL Review and Feedback: -LIC500 needs to be updated and added. -Copy of facility Admission Agreement is not included. San Bernardino County representatives will contact LPA Darlene Oseguera when all corrections and/or revisions have been completed. Community Care Licensing requested stated corrections and/or revisions will be completed and submitted by March 10, 2023.

In attendance in this meeting were: - Nelson Martinez - (Community Care Licensing - CCL Regional Manager - RM) - Helga Wong (Licensing Program Manager - LPM) - Carolyn Flynn (Licensing Program Manager- LPM) - Alicia Bernstein (Provider Policy Implementation Unit, Manager - Policy and Technical Assistance Bureau - Systems of Care Branch) - Gina Jones (Provider Policy Implementation Unit, Associate Governmental Program Analyst - Policy and Technical Assistance Bureau - Systems of Care Branch) - Adele Carlson (Associate Government Program Analyst - Child Protection Policy Unit) - Damion Wright (Department of Family and Children's Services - DFCS Director - Administration, Continuum of Care and Intake Operations) - Gilbert Murillo (Department of Family and Children's Services - DFCS Acting Assistant Director) - Matt Cammann (Seneca Regional Executive Director) - Leticia Galyean (Seneca Chief Executive Officer) - Melissa Lawton (Seneca Chief Program Officer) - Aiko Yano (Seneca Program Director) The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Seneca's - The Welcoming Center (TWC) and Santa Clara County Annual Review that was submitted on 9/21/2023. County representatives discussed the actions that Santa Clara County has taken to reduce the number of (Cont. Lic809-c) clients entering the shelter, including engaging with the families early on, working with Behavioral Health, Public Health Nurses, Probation, reaching out to learn more about STRTPs of one/two, and resource family homes, increasing relative placement's. They discussed the building out of their continuum of care, building out hospital divergent programs, and utilizing a \"Strike Team.\" It was discussed how the county is working with San Andrea Regional Center for their clients with disabilities. The county explained that they are working to partner with specific partners such as Seneca who have STRTPs for one/two. The priority is for a community based program but will consider a county run facility. Explanation of the Mockingbird Constellation was provided. Clarification of how overstays are recorded/tracked was given and discussed. Review of Essential Terms and Operating Standards will be done to ensure that all agree of methods used for tracking the time a youth stays at the shelter. Seneca shared that the County's transition to placement for first time removals is very often done within the first 24 hours or often go directly to care. Many of the clients that utilize the shelter need stabilization and individual support. Collaboration with the DHCS and the county is working well and meet daily and hold CFT's weekly. Seneca provides a very \"homelike\" environment for the client who feel safe and welcomed back when they return to TWC. Seneca will continue to support Santa Clara when the new application is approved and will surrender their license. The Department questioned Santa Clara County, when would a shelter be no longer needed? The county responded that there will always be a need for a shelter. RM reviewed that the license for Seneca Family of Agencies - The Welcoming Center will expire in May 2024 and if an extension is needed that it would need to be requested 30 days prior to expiration in writing. The meeting concluded at 11: AM. No deficiencies were cited during this meeting and a copy of this report is being sent via email to Matt Cammann, Seneca Regional Executive Director, for his signature with a request that a copy of this report be signed and returned to Licensing Program Manger, Carolyn Flynn to file.",

Minutes from the Leadership meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the Risk Screening and Youth Safety Plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPAs Sethany Yem and Dund Mac observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others.
