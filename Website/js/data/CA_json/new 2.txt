"As a survivor-led movement, we know that trauma does not expire. Our opportunities to heal shouldn't expire either. 

We think that if you were abused as a child, you should be able to seek justice whenever you're ready.

Right now, the statute of limitations could get in the way. The current law says that if a child abuse survivor doesn't file a civil lawsuit before they're 20 years old, they cannot ever take their abusers to court.

It took many of us years, sometimes decades, before we were ready to speak about our experiences. Many of our abusers kept us quiet through fear and intimidation tactics. The law should line up with what we need, not what abusers want.

The statute of limitations is a barrier to justice. Help us remove it."
