    "narrative": "On 07/25/2021, the Department received a complaint alleging that a client is being hit by another resident in care while under the care and supervision of staff workers. The focused client (FC) who was identified in the referral provided inconsistent information. The focused client (FC) denied the allegation and stated that the conversation he had with an individual identified as other was not accurate information and stated \"it's not really like that\". The focused client admitted that he reported that he was being hit by another peer and that the staff present was not responding accordingly, however, the FC said it was not true. The FC stated that staff working is always present and is quick to intervene when clients are out of line. The FC identified another client that was bothering him by being hit and stated that it was not true. The focused client (FC) admitted that he likes to horseplay with others and stated that everything is fine and that he feels safe living at the facility. Staff workers who were interviewed denied the allegation that they are allowing a client to bother or harass another resident (peers). Staff workers were in agreement that the focused client (FC) is the one who is actually horse-playing around with other clients. Five of the six clients provided consistent information in confidential interviews and denied the allegation. One client who was identified as hitting the focused client categorically denied the allegation and stated \"it's the other way around\". All clients reported that staff at the facility are always present and had no concerns or complaints overall about the operations at the facility. The individual identified as other who reportedly had direct information about the allegation could not be contacted after several attempts to speak with other by telephone went unanswered. Statements obtained could not corroborate the allegation reported for neglect/lack of supervision by staff working at the facility. Therefore, the above allegation is determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the facility representative for review and signature. No deficiencies were cited at this time.",

It was also alleged that the STRTP staff did not report missing client. Based on review of the client's clothing inventory and statements obtained during interviews, client had several pair of well fitting shoes as well as the boots he was wearing the day of 04/22/24, which belonged to him and fit him well when purchased. Client enjoyed wearing his boots and never informed facility that they did not fit him. Client chose to wear that pair of boots when he left the home without authorization. Same interviews revealed that as client had been consistently leaving the facility in unauthorized fashion upon return, the local Police Department had been leaving an earlier law enforcement report as an open report, therefore, filing another missing person's report is unnecessary at times. Confidential statements obtained during the investigation were unable to corroborate the allegations, revealing inconsistencies. Social worker interviewed by LPA had no concerns regarding the allegations. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

Multiple staff interviews admitted that that the family visits for the client were not happening, but it was due to either the client or the family member declining the visits. Staff testimony stated that family visits were always offered, but they did need to adhere to court mandated monitored visits, and the client or the family member had some refusals in the beginning. The client interview shared that they did not know why visits did not happen in the beginning but admitted that they are taking place now. LPA preformed a records review shows notes from the Intensive Care Coordinator (ICC) who recorded all the offered/set up visits that were declined by the client or the family. Due to conflicting testimonial evidence and the visitation notes, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met, therefore, the allegation of the \"Staff have not properly facilitated family visits\" has been found to be unsubstantiated. LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A client interview shared that a staff member would at times \"get frustrated and leave shift early\" causing supervision and staff-to-client ratio issues. Multiple staff interviews stated that staff never left their shift early and never caused care and supervision issues.

LPA also interviewed three of the four clients and reviewed the disciplinary notice and documentation of retraining given to S1. All staff denied both that they personally committed any of the above allegations and that they witnessed any co-workers committing these allegations, although it was acknowledged that S1 has an aggresive tone of voice and was suspended for speaking harshly to C1. The interviews provided by C1, C2 abd C4 were inconsistent and vague. During the course of the investigation, LPA Jones-Steward was unable to gather enough cohesive information to substantiate or disprove the allegations. Therefore they are resolved as unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the facility's timely response with medical attention. All staff and most client testimonies state that the facility does offer consistent medical care in a timely manner when requested. Staff interviews also clarified how some situations may appear to be neglecting medical concerns but are actually following facility policies. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff does not seek medical attention to minors in a timely manner\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Minor has access to marijuana while in care.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. Witness and client interviews stated that certain clients would smoke marijuana and abuse substances in the facility. Staff interviews stated that while there was a suspicion of a client smoking marijuana in the facility, it was never proven, and a client was never caught actively smoking marijuana in the facility. Staff interviews also shared that the facility consistently offered clients substance abuse help, including offering classes and therapy sessions, but the clients never accepted the offers. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding minors having access to marijuana while in care. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Minor has access to marijuana while in care\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Staff are not meeting minor's mental health needs.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that a client was struggling with suicide and was not helped by the facility. LPA interviewed involved staff who reported that clients are always offered mental health services, including therapy sessions, both individual and group sessions on a consistent basis. Staff interviews explain that while clients often refuse to engage or participate in the clinical services they are still always offered. Staff interviews claimed that no client has ever reported struggling with suicide. Client testimonies confirmed that mental health assistance is offered, but not always accepted by clients. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the mental health services being provided by the facility. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff are not meeting minor's mental health needs\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Staff does not accord minor privacy.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that a client was not being afforded privacy by the facility and would lock themselves in the bathroom to obtain privacy. Staff interviews shared that clients are always afforded privacy, around the facility, and especially in their bedrooms. Client interviews also stated that the facility offered privacy, and clients never had to lock themselves away to get privacy. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding privacy in the facility. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff does not accord minor privacy\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Staff does not allow minor phone calls.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that clients were not allowed to make phone calls freely. Staff interviews shared that clients have access to the facility phone and can make calls freely whenever they want. Staff shared that the only call restrictions were court-ordered restrictions. LPA observed the landline at the facility. Client testimony stated that clients had access to the facility phone at all times, and most clients had their own phones and were able to make calls freely. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the public phone policy for the facility. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff does not allow minor phone calls\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Staff does not prevent other minors from being bullied.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview stated that younger clients often get bullied by older clients. Staff interviews shared that some older clients did pick on and tease younger clients, but the younger clients would also tease and agitate the older clients to get them in trouble. Staff would always intervene and discourage any bullying from any clients. Client interviews stated that there was some bullying happening at the facility. Clients stated that sometimes staff would intervene when it was happening in public, but sometimes they would not follow up on bullying complaints. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding bullying in the facility. No other evidence besides testimonies were provided by any interviewed parties. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff does not prevent other minors from being bullied\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Staff does not ensure minor is provided adequate clothing.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview claimed that a client was not adequately clothed, often walking around without shoes and with shirts with holes in them. Staff interviews stated that clients are always informed and offered to go clothes shopping using the facility budget for new clothes. Staff interviews shared that sometimes clients are comfortable with their current clothes, don't like change, and don't care enough to go shopping for new clothes. Client interviews shared that they were adequately clothed and always provided the opportunity to get new clothes. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding clients being adequately clothed. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff does not ensure minor is provided adequate clothing\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Staff does not follow facility's activity calendar.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview shared that the staff do not update or follow the facility activity calendar. Staff interviews stated that the facility calendar is updated monthly with the participation of the clients. Staff shared that sometimes the activity schedule is not followed only because the clients refuse or deny the scheduled outings and activities. Staff said that it is common for clients on one day to agree to do an activity and then on the next day refuse, which results in the activity or outing being canceled. LPA observed the activity schedule posted in the facility with the correct dates. Client testimonies confirm that the activity schedule is accurate and updated often, but that clients can and often decline to participate in the activities. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the facility's activity schedule. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Staff does not follow facility's activity calendar\" is found to be unsubstantiated. Allegations: \"Facility is operating out of ratio.\" During the course of the investigation, LPA interviewed involved staff, clients, and witnesses. A witness interview stated that the facility often operated out of ration with only 1 staff for every 4/5 clients. The witness claimed that this ratio would last for entire shifts and that it wasn't uncommon. Client testimonies confirmed that the facility sometimes operated with only one direct care staff. Clients also claimed that it wasn't unusual and would last for long periods of time, not just in between shifts. Staff interviews said that the facility never operates out of ratio. Staff interviews state that other staff, including the clinical team, facility managers, and even the administrator, will step in to provide extra coverage when necessary. Sometimes coverage is needed between swing shifts if a staff member is running late, but this is extremely rare. LPA observed the LIC 500 staff roster and schedule and observed adequate 24-hour. coverage. LPA received multiple conflicting testimonies regarding the facility operation out of ratio. Based on the available information LPA gathered from interviews, the preponderance of the evidence standard has not been met; therefore, the allegation of \"Facility is operating out of ratio\" is found to be unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, during which LPA provided the Administrator with a copy of this report and a copy of their appeal rights.",

LPA asked the five clients, \"Have you ever seen a client bullied by staff or other clients?\". Four out of five said no, including the client that the Reporting Party was referring to. One did mention that sometimes one client gets \"messed with\" because he does not follow Covid protocols and other clients feel that he is putting their health and safety at risk. LPA asked the nine staff members, \"Have you ever seen a client bullied by staff or other clients?\". All nine said that the clients do mess with each other but it's within reason for teenage boys and they do not feel like there is any targeting bullying happening. Most of the staff mentioned that if they see bulling they would stop it immediately. Although the allegations, minor is being bullied while in care and facility does not provide a safe environment for minor in care, may have happened or is valid, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

Both witness highlighted that the staff member was driving unsafely as the main reason why they felt the staff was under the influence of cannabis. LPA asked the nine staff members, \"Have you ever observed or know of a Staff member being intoxicated or 'high' while on duty?\" All nine said either \"no\" or \"not sure\". All nine staff members mentioned that they did not physically see it. Some mentioned they only heard about it from some of the clients. One staff member claimed that the allegation is false. They said a staff member was never under the influence around clients. LPA Simien followed up with the question, \"why would clients come together and make this up?\" The staff member said that the clients made up the story to get back at this staff member because they don't like them because they enforce the rules. The staff member said that the clients are roommates and have an agenda against that staff member. On 5/18/ Riverside County Investigator contacted LPA Simien to discuss above listed complaint. The Investigator explained that he was investigating the same complaint. During the discussion it was discovered that one of the clients who told LPA Simien they saw a staff member under the influence of a substance told the Investigator that have never seen a staff member under the influence of a substance. The two statements the client made contradicts each other. Although the allegations, staff transported minor while under influence of a substance, may have happened or is valid, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violation did not occur, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

    "narrative": "brandished a knife at school, not consistently going to school, AWOLS, damaging the facility van door. and failure to improve behavior. CQ was informed of the 14-day notice verbally on 4/25/22. LPA looked up the facility incident report (IR) archive and found the knife incident which occurred on 11/27/21, three IRs for missing school (on 5/2/22, 5/3/22, and 5/4/22 which was after 14-day notice), one AWOL (4/23/22), and the van incident (4/27/22, which was two days after verbal 14-day notice). CQ stated they were told on 4/25/22 that they were given a 14-day notice for missing school and AWOLs. CQ stated they were discriminated against because other clients AWOLed, missed school, and do worse things. CQ said stated that they missed some school and got kicked out at their previous school but had been consistently attending their current school. They stated they only missed school this week (the week starting on 4/25/22) due to having a sore throat and not feeling well. Most individuals interviewed said that other clients were also missing school, AWOLing, with some doing worse/more dangerous things than CQs but did not get 14-day notice. When LPA inquired about the knife incident, CQ stated that they brought the knife to school because they felt threaten by another student and needed it for self-defense. When LPA inquired about the van door incident, CQ stated that it was an accident. They said that the Van door was previously broken and hard to close. When they attempted to close it the first time it did not close, so they closed the door with more force to close it which result in the door flying off the hinge and breaking a window. Most individuals interviewed stated that they knew or heard the van door was broken before that incident. LPA asked individuals interviewed if IUM has ever made them sign a training sheet without receiving training. Most answered not remember ever signing a training sheet, with one individual stating if their name was on a training sheet (it was on the sheet) it was forged and another admitting upper management asked them to create fake training sheets and to fill out the signatures. When LPA inquired about training provided by upper management most individuals stated that it was inadequate. LPA requested and received training material for IRs and trauma informed care (TIC). For IR training the facility sent staff training sign in sheet and a Word document that had reporting requirements regulations copied onto it. For TIC the facility sent a one page flyer that gives a brief general explanation of trauma informed care, unsigned LIC 613B (which lists personal rights), and a staff training sign in sheet. The sheet indicated that one of the trainers was upper management and was qualified to conduct this training since they were STRTP Administrator certified (this is not a qualification to be a trainer of TIC). Facility also stated that TIC training included a 30 minute video but didn't list the title so there was no way for LPA to verify the video. Facility did not provide LPA with certification of TIC for staff. LPA asked individuals if there were some staff that could not do the basic duties of the job. Individuals stated at least one or more could not or would not do basic job duties. Some examples given are not providing food and not picking up medicine for clients. Not preforming room checks, watching tv, doing personal Laundry, washing personal car, and falling sleep while on duty allowing clients to AWOL unnoticed. These examples indicate that some staff members did not provide adequate care and supervision. Most individuals indicated that management was aware of this. Based on LPA interviews and records reviewed, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore the list above allegations, are found to be SUBSTANTIATED. As a result of this visit, there is three General Licensing Standards violations ( Personal Rights(a)(3), Personnel Requirements(a), and Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision(a)) and one Interim Licensing Standards v.4 87065. Supervision, Evaluation and Training Requirement (c)(5) violation. The facility will be cited (see 809-Ds for details). Appeal rights were discussed and provided to HOS.

The main upstairs bathroom had recent damage to the door and a broken window, but the facility covered the glass and has ordered repairs. There is an ample supply of perishable and non-perishable foods. Water temperature was observed to be at 132.8 degrees (see photo). LPA advised ASW that it would need to be between 105 and 120 prior to LPA leaving the facility or he would have to cite for it. ASW stated that the water heater was inaccessible as they built a solid cabinet around it (no doors - see photo) to keep the youth away from it. LPA is issuing a Type A citation for Section Furniture, Fixtures, Equipment, and Supplies. During the course of reviewing records, it was determined that some Law Enforcement Contacts had not been reported to CCL. It was also determined that some Incident Reports do not identify staff corresponding with the actions taken. LPA is issuing a Technical Advisory on both issues. An exit interview was conducted and Appeal Rights were given to the facility. A copy of this report was given to the facility.",

The certificates for outside training(s) and the detailed training materials for in-house trainings will be submitted to the licensing agency as well as maintained on site for future training purposes. The licensee shall develop a post-training competency test/evaluation covering the above topics, and completed tests/evaluations for each training participant shall be available for review on site. 4. LIC 500: Beginning the month of this NCC, facility will complete quarterly submission of LIC 500/staff schedules to CCL, including Administrator hours worked at the facility. Administrator should be on the premises for a minimum of 30 hours per week. Administrator cannot oversee both facilities, and the facility is to send CCL a monthly update and process until they find another Administrator. 5. Access to Files, Needs and Services Plans: Facility will create a plan within 30 days to make staff and youth files readily available for LPA access on inspection. Also, will ensure that all Needs and Service Plans and Updates are available upon request for review. 6. Technical Support Program (optional): CCL has recommended TSP (Technical Support Program) for the facility. If the facility is interested they will notify CCL within 30 days with a written notice. LPA Bertoli reviewed the above items with Administrator Kennedy. The discussion was as follows: Quarterly inspections will continue as stated. LPA will contact Administrator upon arrival to the facility (if not already present) to facilitate access to records. Facility is starting to put together training binder and is expected to be completed by next inspection. Staff training is being completed as stated. No changes in staff since last visit. Training records will be reviewed during next inspection. LIC 500 has been received and is up to date. Facility has a staff person that is a prior Administrator that is in the process of reactivating his Administrator Certificate. This will result in having separate Administrators for each facility. Facility is working on more direct access to staff files. This will likely result in having records available online so that they can be sent to LPA if Administrator is not available on site to access them. Facility may utilize Technical Support Program and will notify LPA when they are ready to do so. No deficiencies were cited at this visit. An exit interview was conducted with Administrator Kennedy and a copy of this report was given to him.",

LPAs toured the facility site, reviewed 5 client files, and interviewed 2 staff and 1 client. 5 clients were in care, 4 clients were present, and 3 declined an interview. LPAs observed the facility to maintain individual client files. The facility is a two-story house in a residential neighborhood and has 3 double-occupancy bedrooms and 3 client bathrooms. LPAs observed the hot water to measure within the permitted range. There is a pool in the backyard that is surrounded by a tall fence with a locked gate. During the tour, around 12:40PM, LPAs observed some areas in need of cleaning. There was trash and food debris and substance residue on the stairs, trash piles in the downstairs den, and unwashed plates in client room and in den, one of the downstairs bathroom vents was blocked with dust, and the kitchen refrigerator had food residue and debris throughout interiors and had the bottom vent blocked with dust. LPAs observed unsecured medications in a client's bedroom. Case Manager was unfamiliar with the items and removed them from the client's bedroom. LPAs also observed multiple beds with none to limited bed linens and linens in the linen closet were not readily accessible due to disorganization of closet and it being unclear whether linens were clean and unused. During the personnel file review, LPAs found that staff S1 (See LIC 811) does not have a background clearance associated to the facility. LPAs informed Administrator about the need to remove the staff from the premises. See Page PAGE During the client file review, LPAs observed that 4 of 5 client files were missing tuberculosis (TB) test results and 5 of 5 client files were missing current allowance distribution records. LPAs are issuing citations of California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 22, Sections Food Service, Buildings and Grounds, Criminal Record Clearance, Client Medical Assessments, Client Records, and Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Section Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment, and Supplies. Additionally, due to the criminal record clearance violation, per CCR 80019(g), LPAs are assessing an immediate civil penalty of $100 per day in violation up to 5 days in violation, for a total of $500. See LIC 421BG. A continuation visit will be conducted to complete this inspection.

A previous continuation visit was conducted on 12/11/24. LPA met with Administrator Derrick Kennedy and informed of the purpose of the visit. During visit, LPA reviewed 5 personnel files, emergency intervention records, disaster preparedness records, and other operations-related records. LPA also discussed with Administrator inspection authority and ways to ensure the availability of personnel files upon request at the facility site while also ensuring the privacy of staff members' confidential information. During the record review, LPA observed files to be well-organized and complete with all required sections. However, LPA observed deficiencies within some sections. LPA learned that the emergency intervention training does not include a hands-on competency test. LPA observed that 4 of 5 staff files reviewed had expired emergency intervention certification. LPA observed that 4 of 4 care staff files were missing performance evaluations. LPA observed that no staff files contained facility manager training, including those staff indicated by Administrator to be facility managers. LPA learned that an emergency drill had not been conducted in the past quarter and that documentation of an emergency drill was not available for review on site. Based on the above, LPA Hawkins is issuing citations of Health and Safety Code Section 1565(c) and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Sections 87095.65(b)(6), 87095.65(e), 87066(b)(6), and 87065(f)(2).

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza, on 01/27/2020 at 11: AM, conducted scheduled case management via Microsoft Team (virtual inspection) due to COVID-19. During the inspection, LPA Mendoza met with Administrator Augie Arballo and Justine Underhill, Chief Program Officer. The purpose of today's meeting was to discuss the recent incident/discharge on (C1) (please refer to LIC 811, dated 01/27/2021 for confidential names.) Also, to discuss the facility's current implementation/ COVID- Mask Wearing Policy. On 12/10/ San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) and Community Care Licensing (CCL) held a COVID- Migration meeting with the facility. During the meeting, the facility informed both agencies that the facility implemented a Mask Wearing Policy for the clients in care, approved by Licensing Program Manager Zaid Hakim and Regional Manager Nelson Martinez. The Mask Wearing Policy is to ensure that the facility maintains the safest possible environment. That all clients and staff must wear a mask while on campus and when around others. The Mask Wearing Policy is administered to all new clients and their authorized representatives at intake and discussed with both parties. Per the conditions, the youth is given three incidents/chances. During each incident the facility/ clients team will be working closely with the authorized representative and scheduling meetings/phone calls, and coming up with a safety plan on getting the youth to wear their masks. If it gets to three incidents, then the facility will be discussing discharging the child from the program. During the 12/10/20 meeting, CCL stressed the importance of a behavioral approach that is consistent with their Program Statement and the STRTP Interim Licensing Standards. Cont. Lic 809-c There would need to be a reasonable process to engage in before discharging the youth. If the facility happens to come across this, they must notify LPA Mendoza and would need to start with having incident reports sent on initial and subsequent refusals to wear masks. Also, should follow all recent ACL (All County Letters) and PINS (Provider Information Notices). The facility informed CCL that they would comply with the above. On 1/19/21 via email LPA Mendoza was informed by Justine that the facility has a new client (C1) who is showing early signs of refusing to wear their mask. The facility will start implementing their Mask Wearing Policy and will reach out to the authorized representative if there are no changes. They wanted guidance on what to do if the client continues. LPA responded, the staff should be documenting all of this, and must include how frequent the client needs prompting on this behavior. If the behavior continues after the facility meets with the authorized representative and create a safety plan an incident report must be submitted to LPA Mendoza. In the incident report, the facility should include the safety plan/strategies that the facility will be doing with the youth, and include what was discussed in the meeting and who attended. Also, to include the number of interventions that the facility staff took with the youth, and what they were and they outcomes. If it gets to the final stages where the facility will be discharging the youth the facility must send another incident report/follow up. Include in the IR that this is the clients final stage on Mask Wearing Policy and include what was discussed with the authorized representative and attach the discharge notice that was submitted to the authorized representative. On 1/25/ LPA Mendoza received another email from Justine informing LPA that C1 is still refusing to wear their mask, and the facility staff have had three separate meetings with the C1, C1's treatment team, and parent. The facility is planning to discharge the C1. LPA received two SIR on 1/26/21, dated 1/20/21 and 1/21/21. After reviewing both SIR the facility did not include what the clients safety plan around mask wearing, or what was discussed in the meetings. The SIR had no information on dates or times the facility meeting with C1's authorized representative. The facility asked C1 open ended questions about the mask wearing policy. Both SIRs did not elaborate on steps or methods that the facility took. Also, what were the outcomes from each step. Per the IR, C1 would struggle with following staff instructions to keep her mask on above her nose and mouth throughout the day. 1/21/21 was the final warning and IR did not include discharge notices or written notice that was sent to authorized representative. During todays inspection, LPA took the time to go over CCL's expectations when it comes to Mask Wearing Policy and ILS 87068. Removal And/Or Transfer Procedures. LPA expressed the importance of the facility sending detailed IRs to LPA Mendoza and to submit them to LPA within 24-48 hours if the youth is exhibiting daily struggles with mask wearing. The IRs must include all the interventions that were taken, outcomes, issue around mask wearing, and include the seriousness/urgency on removing the youth. IR must include the timeline on discussions, meetings, and phone calls. If it reaches to the level of discharging the youth. The facility must follow ILS 87068.4 and ensure they submit a written notice to authorized representative and include the authorized rep in discharge procedure. C1 struggled with wearing her mask on a daily. The facility has to constantly prompt the youth to wear or mask. The facility even got the C1 different types of mask, however C1 still refused. C1 will be getting discharged today at 3:30. C1 was a private placement/hospital diversion and was only scheduled to receive services with the facility for 14 days. C1's mother agreed to pick up the youth. The facility informed LPA that the facility had a total of SIRs on C1 regarding mask wearing. Administrator, will forward SIRs the additional IRs that LPA is missing 2nd 21st IR, 23rd, and 26th) to LPA by end of day. No citations were cited during todays inspection. An exit interview was conducted. Administrator agrees to sign all three documents and will return back to LPA via email.",

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Non-Compliance quarterly submissions from April 2020 to December 2020 and other conditions of the NCC. During the meeting CCL staff and facility staff also discussed a new electronic staff training system that the facility would like to incorporate. Present in the meeting were Chief Executive Officer, Lynn Dolce, Chief Program Officer Justine Underhill, Human Resources Director, Michael Russel, and Administrator, Augie Arballo. Present from CDSS were Regional Manager (RM) Nelson Martinez, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Zaid Hakim, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Brian Bertoli, and Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) David Hiett. On 10/07/2019 a Non-Compliance Conference (NCC) was held with facility representatives. Following the 10/07/ NCC, it was determined the facility was not in full compliance in meeting CCL's expectations regarding policies, procedures, and documentation. On 03/06/2020 an Informal Meeting was conducted to clarify CCL's expectations on NCC submissions. Per the NCC requirements, it was agreed that the facility will submit the below items to CCL in one complete package, on a quarterly basis on the 1st of every month. 1. Personal Rights Training- All staff training on CCL Personal Rights. The facility is to include a sign-in sheet, training materials, trainer's information/credentials, and include the length of this training. Please refer to LIC 809-C.. 2. \"What Grooming Looks Like\" Training-. All staff and clients at intake must be trained on this topic. The facility is to include a sign-in sheet. Sign-in sheets for clients will include the youths full name, DOB, authorized representatives full name, and date of placement. Training for both staff and youth will include training materials and trainer's qualification along with summary. 3. Training on Boundaries- An all staff training. The facility is to include a sign-in sheet, training materials, trainer's information/credentials, and include the length of this training. 4. Twice a month Upper Management team will conduct unannounced up night visits and submit log, with date time, and summary. This will be submitted quarterly. 5. Up night Bed Check Logs-Submit up night bed logs on a quarterly basis for all cottages. Complete full overnight bed log. Enter all information, youths name, room number, circle shift. Two staff conduct room checks. Both signatures, and manager initials and signs on bottom of each shift. LPA Mendoza received the following quarterly submissions: 05/01/2020, 08/01/2020, and 12/01/2020. The facility requested an extension in October 2020 to submit the 11/01/2020 submission on 12/01/2020 due to the facility having a COVID-19 outbreak, which was approved by LPM Hakim. The facility submitted all three NCC submissions on time and in a full package. LPA Mendoza notes the facility did not submit a complete submission on 05/01/2020, the facility submitted all items in various emails to LPA Mendoza. Which were observed to be complete after receipt of all items. Per the comprehensive review of all quarterly submissions from February 2020 to October 2020, LPA Mendoza found no issues with client training on grooming. This training is performed with new clients at intake. LPA observed the following inconsistencies with the bed logs and NCC submissions: Please cont.to LIC 809-C for additional page. \u00b7 Per the NCC, the facility is only required to submit the overnight logs. The facility submitted staff shift logs for all staff shifts (AM, Swing, and Overnight), rather than just the overnight records. This was acknowledged during the meeting on 02/02/2021 and the facility committed to correcting this item. \u00b7 Throughout LPA's review, LPA found several staff shift logs that did not have all items completed on the bed logs. At times, LPA could not always confirm the appropriate shift log, client's room number, or entry date. The facility must ensure to complete all items on overnight bed logs. This was acknowledged during the meeting on 02/02/2021 and the facility committed to correcting this item. Example: For February 2020, Halleck cottage did not have overnight bed logs for 2/1,2/2, 2/7, and 2/16. For February 2020, the upper managers only performed one random up night visit and not two. For the 08/1/2020 submission, which covers May 2020 to July 2020: May Halleck Cottage bed logs were missing: 5/6/20 and 5/12/2020. July Bed logs missing: 7/25/20, 7/29/20,7/30/20. Also, several entries did not have management approvals/signatures. For June 2020, there was only one upper management inspection performed. For the 12/01/2020 submission, which covers August 2020 to October 2020: September Stow Cottage, LPA observed numerous entries with only one staff performing bed checks due to the facility being short-staffed. Also, a few entries where bed checks started at 1-2 am. Overnight bed logs are to be performed from 10:15 pm- 6:45 am, with 15-minute bed checks. LPA Mendoza also found this with the October Halleck cottage. Also, for October 2020, LPA observed the facility did not conduct the twice a month upper management unannounced visit. Please cont. Lic 809-c. Staff training- The facility submitted several excel spreadsheets and a list of names for all staff training (Personal Rights, Personal Boundaries, and Grooming/Child Abuse). LPA found in every submission that all staff did not complete all three pieces of training. For the staff that did not complete any of the trainings, the facility did not give any explanation. Due to the high volume of excel sheets and the list of names, LPA had a difficult time cross-reference names because excel sheets did not always include all three training pieces in one excel sheet or list. Also, reports did not include the length of time of each training. The excel sheet only had the time the staff member completed the training. \u00b7 The facility is not required to submit Up night Facility manager logs. Moving forward, CCL is only asking for Upper Manager oversight logs to ensure staff accountability, to be verified 2x per month, captured on the training reporting tool. During today's meeting, CCL provided the facility with a new training reporting tool/excel sheet template that meets the Department's requirements per terms of the NCC. CCL would like the facility to incorporate this tool for all staff training and client grooming submissions, the benefit being a centralized document that is user-friendly and easy to understand. CCL informed the facility that CCL wants to ensure the facility follows all NCC guidelines, but that the tools used by both parties are practical and efficient. During the meeting LPA Hiett provided a demonstration of a sample training reporting tool and provided instruction as to how to navigate and use the training reporting tool. Facility staff mentioned that their own Staff Training team have existing internal methods and tools. The facility agreed to combine efforts in this area to produce a training reporting tool that meets the Department's requirements. The facility and CCL staff have agreed to work collaboratively on a training reporting tool. The primary focus of this NCC item is to ensure staff and client training(s) are conducted and reported, clearly. After discussing the NCC submission review, on 02/02/ CCL informed the facility that the facility had not yet fulfilled all NCC requirements. Therefore, the facility is to remain on Please refer to LIC 909-C. the NCC status. The facility is to submit two more quarterly submissions, Due 04/01/2021 and 07/01/2021. After each submission, CCL will promptly complete a review of the submissions and schedule a meeting with the facility to review findings. The facility will continue to submit all NCC items along with the new training reporting tool. They are also requested to submit with their quarterly submission an updated LIC 500 (Staff schedule). LPA Mendoza will use this to cross-reference staff names with the staff training submission to ensure all staff has completed the required quarterly training. LPA Mendoza reminded the facility for the 04/01/20 submission to include the overnight bed logs for November 2020 and December 2020. The facility agreed to submit the following on 04/01/2021 and 07/01/2021: 1. Up night bed check logs for that quarter 2. Training Reporting Tool (or variation) including the following: Client Grooming training during intake, Staff training - Personal Rights, Grooming, Client / Staff Boundaries, Upper Manager up night bed check log oversight 2x per month 3. Training material 4. LIC 500 for that quarter ** Up night bed check logs for November 2020 and December 2020 to be submitted on 04/01/2021 as well. Following the future quarterly submissions on 04/01/2021 and 07/01/2021 - CCL and facility staff will conduct a meeting to review findings and discuss facility standing. Based on quarterly submissions and overall facility performance with respect to compliance and health safety, CCL will re-evaluate NCC status. Please continue to LIC 809-C... Lastly, the facility informed CCL that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the facility HR team have been working remotely, and the facility is looking to create all staff personnel folders and training electronically. Michael, the new HR Director, is currently working on this and wanted to ensure that it would follow all CCL standards. CCL informed the facility that the department does not have an issue with them migrating their personnel files to be stored electronically. CCL stressed the importance of ensuring that all staff files and training must be readily available during all inspections. All staff must have the required LIC forms per annual reviews, initial training, ongoing training, etc. The facility can either do them electronically or keep a file at the facility. Also, the facility must ensure that it follows all policies and requirements per Title Regulations. CEO informed CCL that the HR director or HR personnel would only have access to staff records/training. CCL advised the facility that a staff that is physically in the facility must have access. CCL inspections are unannounced, so the facility needs to ensure that the files are readily available within 20-30 minutes of LPA's arrival and request. The facility agreed to these conditions. CCL understands the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and is committed to being flexible and working collaboratively with the facility. This report was sent via email to Chief Executive Officer Lynn Dolce, Chief Program Officer Justine Underhill, Human Resources Director Michael Russel, and Administrator Augie Arballo for signature. The facility agrees to sign and scan back to LPA Mendoza no later than 02/04/2021. This report was revised on 02/04/2021 to correct typos. The facility received a corrected version of this report on 02/04/2021.",

    "narrative": "On Thursday, February 25, 2021 at 9 am Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza made a case management visit to deliver findings of investigation that was conducted by the Investigation Branch (IB) on 04/22/2020 by Investigator, Victoria McIntosh. LPA met with Administrator Augie Arballo. Due to COVID-19 social distancing orders, this visit was scheduled in advance as a tele-visit. On 04/20/2020 it was reported to Community Care Licensing (CCL) that a former overnight staff member (S1) (please refer to LIC 811 for confidential names, dated 02/16/21) sexually abused (C1) while in care. Based on the severity, it was referred to IB and accepted as a full investigation. Based on the IB report, Case No: CD1420-04069 in which Investigator, interviewed numerous individuals; Edgewood staff(s), former, and former residents, and reviewed documentation. There was no sufficient evidence to confirm if (C1) was sexually abused by (S1) while in care. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove the above allegation therefore, the above allegation is Unsubstantiated. After LPA Mendoza thoroughly reviewed the IB report and reviewed all interviews and documentation it was learned that the facility failed to keep C1 safe back in 2018 when C1 was in care. The facility failed to keep all of C1's records from 2018. It was reported that (C1) reported feeling very uncomfortable and unsafe in the facility because of another client (C2). This client would try to touch (C1) inappropriately when staff members were not around and wrote inappropriate love letters to C1. Due to this, the facility conducted an internal investigation, on 06/08/2018 in which showed that (C2) wrote two love letters C1 and prove the above to be true. The above information, could have helped IB Investigator, McIntosh with their investigation because it was reported to CCL that S1 wrote love letters to C1. However, IB was unable to obtain copies of these love letters. Please refer to LIC 809-C for additional pages. Because the facility no longer had these letters in C1's file. The facility is cited for California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Interim Licensing Standards, Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program: 87070(f) Children's Records and 87072(10) Personal Rights. Exit interview conducted, appeal rights discussed, and a copy of this report was emailed to the Administrator for signature. Please refer to LIC 809-D. Appeal rights were discussed.",

    "narrative": "On Wednesday, April 14, 2021, at 2: PM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza made a case management visit to the facility regarding several Special Incident Report (SIRs) that were submitted to Community Care Licensing on April 6, 2021, regarding inappropriate touching between clients. The SIR dated (04/01/21) stated that Client #1 (C1) (see Confidential Names form (LIC 811), dated April 14, 2021}) reported to staff that (C1) has been \"sexually touched\" by another client (C2). The purpose of today's inspection was to gather additional information and interview the Administrator and (C1). Also, collect Need and Service and Behavior Plan for the three involved clients: (C1), (C2), and (C3). Based on documentation/incident reports, two dated 4/1/21 for (C1 and C3), 4/5/ SIR (C1) and 4/6/ SIR (C1), and interviews that LPA Mendoza conducted with staff members and clients, it was confirmed that there was inappropriate touching between C1 and C2 and another client (C3) witnessed it. All three clients were watching a movie in a common area, and C2 touched C1's private part over his pants. Also, staff members found a letter that former client (C2) wrote to (C1) about the incident. The facility submitted a copy of this letter to LPA Mendoza on 04/09/21 and submitted an incident report. Based on interviews it was confirmed that inappropriate touching occurred between C1 and C2. A staff member was present but was sitting at a far distance and did not see the incident. Also, interviews confirmed that (C1) and (C2) dated for a short time while at the facility. Both clients would write letters to each other to support one another during their stay at the facility, which would bring comfort to both youth. Also, based on interviews, it was reported when (C2) was first admitted at the facility, (C3) would harass (C2). (C3) would write inappropriate letters to (C2) expressing their feelings. Also, touched (C2) inappropriately when staff was not around. Please Refer to Lic 809-c for Cont. Page.. (C2) reported this to staff and asked for support on how to handle this situation and wanting help. Staff immediately implemented a staffing plan around (C2) and (C3), so they would not be left alone. Interviews and documentation confirmed this to be true. (C3) has a history of having poor boundaries and constantly needs to be reminded by the facility staff. Based on the above information and information gathered, LPA is issuing an advisory per California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 87065. Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios. The facility will also be cited under 87072(11) Personal Rights and 87065.2(b)(1) Personnel Duties.

    "narrative": "On Tuesday 6/22/21 at 9AM, Licensing Program Analysts (LPA's) Isabel Mendoza and Mariah Hawkins met with facility Administrator Augie Arballo for an unannounced annual/required inspection. The STRTP facility consists of four cottages, and only two cottages are being used (Stow and Halleck). This STRTP is licensed for a capacity of 48 and currently has a census of 15 with 7 residents in Halleck and 8 in Stow. At 9:20AM, LPA's Mendoza and Hawkins inspected Stow Cottage. At 10:45AM, LPA's inspected Hallek. LPA's observed the following: Water temperature measured F throughout the cottage. LPA advised the facility to change the temperature. The heater was adjusted, and at 10:38AM the water measured F. At 9:31AM, LPA's observed that the Stow living room / lounge spaces were untidy. There were cards and games pieces spread out on shelves in a disorganized fashion. Halleck was inspected afterwards and was observed to be tidier, but LPA's still observed games pieces on the floor and tossed into drawers without being put away properly, such as back in the puzzle or game box. At 9:54AM, LPA's observed the Stow recreation room to be untidy and unclean. There were toys, game pieces, and other items on the floor and disorganized on the shelves. There was debris on the carpet, which did not appear to have been recently cleaned. Surfaces were unclean. Curtains were missing or in need of repair. At 9:49AM, LPA's observed three rat traps in the downstairs Stow utility room. Administrator stated the site does not have nor recently had a bug or mouse infestation or concern but does have an exterminator come out weekly. Multiple cobwebs and spiders were observed throughout the facility site. At 9:55AM, LPA's observed a trail of ants observed on two walls of the recreation room. At 9:57AM, LPA's observed the table and couch in the hallway outside the Stow recreation room were dirty. At 9:58AM, LPA's observed behind the hallway table an exposed glue trap with dead bugs and a large dead spider on it. The trap appeared to be old and needed to be replaced. At 10:05AM, LPA's observed rat droppings, an exposed glue trap, and a plate underneath the sofa in the clinician's office in the Stow Cottage basement. At 12:50PM, LPA's inspected the exterminator invoices and observed the following: 6/14/21, 1 mouse removed from admin building, 1 mouse removed from Stow Cottage; 5/24/21, 2 mice removed from Lane Cottage basement and laundry room; 5/10/21, removed 2 mice from admin building, removed 1 mouse from Halleck Cottage kitchen dry food storage; 4/26/21, removed 1 mouse from admin building; 4/12/21, removed 2 mice from Halleck Cottage kitchen area and basement; 1/25/21, removed 1 mouse from admin building; 12/28/20, removed 1 rat from Stow Cottage, removed 2 mice from Williams Building (CSU building), removed 1 mouse from Lane Cottage basement, currently vacant; 11/30/20, removed 1 mouse from Lane Cottage basement; 11/17/20, removed 1 rat from admin building, removed 1 rat from Halleck Cottage; 8/14/20, removed 1 mouse from Stow Cottage under sink, removed 1 mouse from admin building basement, removed 1 mouse from Lane Cottage under stove; 7/21/20, removed 1 rat and 1 mouse. Per the invoice records for June 2020 through June 2021, the exterminator has removed over 20 rodents (mice, rats) from the various cottages and admin building, including from the kitchen, basement, and laundry, as well as rodents from external traps. No report regarding these incidents was made to CCL, and Administrator stated he was not aware of the issue. At 9:33AM, LPA's observed the Stow kitchen to be messy. Cabinets and drawers in each cottage have food crumbs and grime, the refrigerators in each cottage were dirty, pantry shelves in Halleck Cottage were dirty and had dripping containers. The kitchen and dining areas need to be cleaned and sanitized. LPA's observed a nonfunctional dishwasher in the Stow kitchen, a nonfunctional oven (glass door broken this morning) in the Halleck kitchen, and a nonfunctional refrigerator in the Halleck dining room. Staff stated the oven would be replaced and the refrigerator will be checked for functionality by the licensee's facilities department. Additionally, no menu was posted in the Stow kitchen, but staff moved the menu from upstairs to the kitchen. LPA's observed multiple spills of food or paint on walls throughout the site, including coffee spill on fan in upstairs Halleck, brown splatter in bedroom in Halleck, and unknown splatters near trash cans in Stow basement hallway. LPA's also observed small graffiti, such as a small drawing of male genitalia in the Halleck lounge; old ink marks, such as the billiards game list of client names from 4/06/06 on a cabinet door in the Stow recreation room; paint splatters, such as in the Halleck basement classroom cabinet areas and Halleck client bedroom; and stickers on the high ceilings of the upstairs Stow Cottage near the bedrooms. Staff were not clear as to how youth got the stickers on the ceiling. Administrator reported the facility is cleaned and disinfected at least three times each day at shift changes. Facility Manager S1 (See LIC Confidential Names) reported that there is a cleaning crew who clean most of the site twice daily but focus more on frequently used spaces rather than pass-through spaces like hallways. At 10:30AM, and throughout the tour, LPA's observed the client bedrooms to be disorganized. Client belongings in the wardrobes and in the under bed storage were messy with items scattered around. Wardrobes were somewhat empty, clothes unfolded and piled inside, and not all clothes appeared to be clean. Staff reported clients are not always comfortable with staff touching their belongings, but clients do not appear to be assisted effectively with organization and related life skills. Administrator stated they will get cloth bins for wardrobe storage. At 10:33AM, LPA's observed more than 5 windows propped open with various items. Multiple bedroom windows were propped open with large books. One window was propped open with a puzzle box, one with a sweatshirt, and another window in one of the upstairs Stow bathrooms was propped open with a wad of paper towels. Some items, such as the books, could be hazardous if they fell from the window sill to the ground below. At 10:22AM, LPA's observed a posting in Stow Cottage of a dress code with policies such as disallowing shoulders from being uncovered. Administrator stated this is in the program plan, and LPA's requested this be checked. At approximately 11:30AM, Administrator reported to LPA's that after checking the program plan, the dress code policy is not included and was not approved by the Licensing agency. LPA's observed both first aid kits, in Stow and Halleck, to be incomplete with the following items missing or in very low supply: tweezers; alcohol pads; bandages; antiseptic solution. LPA's observed chairs in the upstairs hallways near the bedrooms blocking the passageway. The chairs were for staff providing supervision. LPA's advised that the chairs be moved to avoid obstructing the hallway or that smaller chairs be used, since the hallways are somewhat narrow. LPA's discussed the medication administration procedures with staff. Per staff, medications are transferred from the medication bottle to envelopes and given to evening/night staff to administer to youth who are to take medications at a time after the nursing staff have left for the day. LPA's advised the facility does not transfer medications between containers and instead have staff who have access to the medications administer the medications. Grounds were free of obstruction and hazards. There are no bodies of water on the premises. Administrator reported that there are no firearms or ammunition at the facility site. Medications are stored in medication cabinets in locked staff closets in the upstairs staff offices of each cottage and in the nursing office. Sharps were stored in locked cabinets in the kitchens and were inaccessible to clients. The facility had food to meet the 7-day nonperishable, 2-day perishable mandate. Clients have individual beds.

LPA Mendoza found the following on client staff files: Staff (S1), (please refer to LIC 811, dated 6/30/21 for confidential names) First Aid and CPR expired on 2/28/21. Also, (S2) and (S3) did not have First Aid/CPR on file. During inspection, LPA requested to see updated CPR/First Aid for all three staff members. All three staff have current First Aid/CPR. The facility developed an in house Certificate of Completion for staff members that attended in house training. LPA Mendoza advised the facility to include the hours of training so LPA or other agencies can confirm hours that were complete. During todays inspection LPA Mendoza reviewed three staff files.

    "narrative": "On Wednesday, July 21, 2021, at 10: AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Isabel Mendoza and Christopher Rollins conducted a Case Management legal/non-compliance inspection. LPA's met with Administrator Augie Arballo, and SF Regional Director, Christina Garcia . The purpose of the inspection was to provide the facility feedback on the 7/1/ NCC submission. The 7/1/21 quarterly submission covers April 2021-June 2021 items. Please note, the April quarterly submission, which covers Jan - March 2021, was provided to the facility via email on 7/13/21. Per the NCC requirements, the facility submitted the below items via thumb drive to LPA Mendoza. 1. All staff is required to take the following training topics quarterly. Also, to provide a list of staff and training on the Excel template that CCL created. \u00b7 Personal Rights Training \u00b7 Child Abuse/\" What Grooming Looks Likes\" \u00b7 Boundaries 2. At intake, all youth trained on \"What grooming looks like\" 3. Twice a month, Upper Management conducts unannounced up-night visits. 4. Up night Bed Check Logs- for the following three months (April, May, and June) 5. November and December Up night bed check logs. CCL requested the facility to submit this on 4/1/21 submission during the 2/3/21 inspection. However, the facility did not, so LPA Mendoza asked the facility to submit it with the 7/1/21 submission. [Cont. to LIC 809-C] 6. LIC 500/Staff schedule. The facility did not include the LIC 500 on the original submission, so LPA requested it on 7/8/21. Later that day, LPA obtained a copy of LIC 500. After conducting a comprehensive review on 7/1/21 submission, LPA observed the following items: LPA Mendoza found no issues with client training on grooming. This training is performed with new clients at intake. All staff required training has been complete. Twice a month, upper management random up night visits were completed in April, May, and June. During LPA's review of Excel training spreadsheet, it was learned that the facility includes all employees on the excel sheet. This information was communicated to LPA Mendoza via telephone. However, LIC 500 only listed all staff that provide care and supervision. The facility had a meeting with LPM Juanita Arroyo on 7/20/21 regarding the training excel sheet. The facility will update excel sheet and highlight all staff members who require all three training's. Due to the high volume of entries, LPA made a random selection and reviewed Halleck cottage overnight bed logs for the month of April and May. In April, there were 12 entries where staff performed single bed checks for long periods or several 15 min entries. In May, there was a total of 6-bed logs where staff performed two-person bed checks; all other entries were single bed checks. Based on internal \"justification forms,\" single bed checks were performed by one staff because of either; low staffing, insufficient staffing, or [CONT. to LIC 809-C] , or not enough staff coverage during breaks. LPA Mendoza obtained copies of the April and May justification forms. For the month of June, none were submitted. During LPA's review of May bed logs, the facility updated their overnight bed logs on 5/27/21. The overnight bed logs now request staff members to mark either \"yes\" or \"no\" if they performed single bed checks. This information was not communicated to LPA Mendoza per NCC condition. The facility will submit an updated Up night Policy reflecting change to the overnight bed logs. Also, LPA noticed that the overnight shift changed from 10: PM-6: AM to PM to AM. For the month of June, LPA reviewed Stow cottage logs and found a total of 13 entries where staff performed single bed checks. November and December 2020 bed logs: LPA reviewed November (Stow) cottage, and upon review, the facility only submitted 11/1/2020-11/5/2020 overnight bed logs. Administrator confirmed after 11/5/20 the facility did not have any clients in care, due to COVID-19 outbreak. LPA Mendoza reviewed Halleck's November bed logs, and 11/22/20-11/24/20 were missing. Also, there were four entries where staff performed single bed checks, or staff only did one-hour bed checks. LPA reviewed Stow December bed logs from 12/1/2020-12/10/2020, and bed checks were performed by two staff members every 15 minutes. Halleck bed logs from 12/1/20-12/14/20 were reviewed, and LPA observed five entries where staff did single bed checks. During the inspection, LPA Mendoza provided the facility with a copy of LPA's overnight bed log review for all five months, including all specific dates and times of single bed checks. CCL notified the facility that the facilities NCC status is still under review by CCL. Currently, the facility needs to submit the following items for 4/1/21 submission, which was provided via email. LIC 500 for the April NCC submission, justification forms for Stow cottage from Jan-March, and a written plan on what the Administrator and upper management team plan to do to ensure that the overnight has adequate coverage and following all NCC requirements. LPA Mendoza received a thumb drive for most recent bed logs for July, and reviewed several Halleck and found several single bed checks. Justification forms were not included, so LPA Mendoza gave it back to Administrator to include justification forms and submit to LPA. [ Please Refer to Lic 809-c] During todays inspection, Augie and Christina stated that the facilities initial overnight bed check policy stated if a single bed check was performed that the facility would do a justification form. The justification form would cover all single bed checks. During inspection, LPA reviewed all NCC/meeting reports and 812's and could not find anything on this matter. LPA will send policy to LPM for review for future clarification. An exit interview was conducted, and the facility was cited under California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 87065. Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios. A copy of the report was left with the Administrator.",

Certain files were reviewed such as psychotropic medication administration records, facility personal report, resident case plans, resident identification and emergency information, resident placement agreements, along with previous facility inspection reports.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that a facility staff engaged in a physical altercation with facility clients, facility staff hit a facility client resulting in injuries, a facility staff choked facility clients during an altercation, and facility staff did not intervene in facility clients being abused. The investigation revealed that two facility clients attacked a staff, Reference #1, at the facility. Reference #1 allegedly retaliated by hitting and choking the facility clients, but interviews with Reference #1 and other staff present during the incident did not corroborate the allegations that the staff hit or choked facility clients. Reference #1 stated that he re-directed the clients when they started to attack him, and when re-direction did not work, he distanced himself from the facility by leaving in his vehicle as the clients followed and attacked him even as he went to his vehicle that was parked right outside of the facility. There were two other staff present during the incident which indicated that the facility had adequate staffing during the incident. Other staff indicated that Reference #1 never hit or choked any of the clients, and staff did not neglect to intervene during the incident as they attempted to re-direct and stand between the clients and Reference #1 during the incident. Another staff indicated that none of the clients sustained any injuries from physical abuse by Reference #1. Confidential statements obtained from a facility client indicated that there were no injuries observed on any of the residents at the facility after the incident, and staff treat clients well and does not neglect intervening when necessary. Based on the information gathered, although the allegations may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegations was not met, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, Confidential Names Form and Appeal Rights were provided to the facility representative via electronic mail. There were no deficiencies cited during this inspection.",

Administrator and staff had similar statements denying the allegation. Administrator and staff stated they do not speak to children inappropriately or rudely or overhear other staff treating children unfairly or rudely. Additionally, they stated that all children are treated the same and that they have not received complaints or information from children that suggest staff disrespect anyone in or out of the home. Interviews conducted with children varied in that one (1) child stated that they felt as though staff were disrespectful and that one (1) staff called them and another person an inappropriate name. However, child could not recall the specific date of when incident occurred or in what context and recounted the incident occurring only once. Interviews conducted with two (2) other children stated that all staff are nice and that they do not recall hearing anyone residing in the home or out being called inappropriate names by staff. Documents reviewed identified no incidents being documented of staff treating children disrespectfully. It was also alleged, facility feeds youths burnt food. Staff and Administrator denied the allegation and again had similar statements that various staff and children cook meals in the home. Staff could not recall an incident when staff or a child burned a meal or tried serving a burnt meal for someone to eat. Staff stated they monitor the children while they are cooking and if staff or children ever burned food, they would throw it out and cook something else. Children had similar statements in that they could not recall a specific incident of being served burnt food. Children stated that children and staff cook meals and that there is ample food to cook in the home. Lastly, it was alleged facility has expired food. During initial inspection LPA Mahecha and Administrator toured the home including the food supply. LPA observed perishable and non-perishable foods as well as the emergency food supply. LPA observed dates of when food was bought and dates of expiration. All food observed was properly marked and expiration dates were marked appropriately. Food was not observed to be moldy or have any past expiration dates. Staff had similar statements and stated that food is checked weekly, groceries are bought weekly and if moldy food is observed it is discarded immediately. Interviews conducted with children varied in that two (2) children stated that they had not observed expired or moldy food but one (1) child stated that they observed two-week-old expired food. LPA observed documented observation of alleged expired food, however, date observed was date of food being bought and not of expiration date. Additionally, documents reviewed identified groceries being bought weekly and ample food being bought for all children in care. LPA was unable to contact county social workers but documents reviewed identified incidents and issues occurring with one child but no documents identified issues with facility or staff within the facility. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated.

The purpose of the inspection was to discuss information discovered during the investigation of a complaint. During the investigation it was discovered that in January 2021 the agency was experiencing a shortage of staff, at the Scoffield House, the staff ratio was 2 staff to 6 children. On 1/26/21 a child in the home was restrained by a staff and an untrained staff observed the restraint which resulted in injury. When LPA asked staff if it was a choice to reach out to another house for help it was stated that it was not an option due to being short staffed. Per Bill this information is not true, and it was a possibility to reach out to other staff for support. While LPA reviewed the incident reports for 1/26/ LPA observed that there was missing pertinent information in the report. LPA addressed these concerns with Bill Sneed. Bill and LPA Tinoco discussed the information that needs to be included in incident reports, Bill stated he will be making those corrections by retraining staff. The Department determined this to be an immediate risk to health and safety of the children in care at this time, therefore the Facility was cited for The Interim Licensing Standard (ILS) Chapter 7.

LPA Segura met with Administrator Jaime Puga and both toured the facility inside and out. The STRTP is licensed to serve six clients, ages 7 - 17 years old and non-minor dependents. Currently in placement are five clients. All of whom are taking psychotropic medication; LPA only reviewed files for four clients as one has been placed less than 30 days. At approximately 9:45am LPA Segura began to review four client files. The administrator Jaime Puga assisted LPA Segura with reviewing the files. In the course of reviewing client files LPA Segura noted that the facility is not including services the child is receiving from the facility such as group therapy, this was found to be the case for all four clients. The facility however, is noting when children attend outside mental health services in the client file. See advisory note. At approximately 11:30am LPA Segura and Administrator Puga conducted a medication count and found it to be in compliance. LPA counted medication based on the centrally stored log start dates. The facility receives bubble packs from the pharmacy which made observing and count of the pills easier. Continued on 809C Interviews were conducted with two staff, facility managers S2 and S3 and administrator Puga (Staff 2, 3, see confidential Names list, LIC 811 dated 09/29/21; includes names for four children subject to this review).

(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, 05/26/2022). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Kyane observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Alvaro Juarez, Facility Administrator.",

LPA obtained a current LIC 500 and observed all staff listed to be on the Guardian background clearance roster. However, four staff members were observed to not have a LIC 508 uploaded to the Guardian site but did have a LIC 508 in the personnel files. LPA discussed with Administrator and demonstrated where to locate the current version of the LIC 508 and LIC 508D forms on the licensing website, how to upload the form to the Guardian site, and how to check for eligibility status on the Guardian roster.

A teleconference call was conducted due to Covid-19 protocols. A case management was initiated by the Department being informed of C1 (see confidential names list) having an expired JV-220. LPA requested copies of the C1's medication list, medication administration record, expired JV-220, physician's denial of emergency authorization, medication authorization from Placer County, and needs & services. On May 28, 2021, LPA was informed by Amberly Sabado, Facility Social Worker (FSW), a child in the facility was being issued psychotropic medication without a current JV-220. FSW stated C1 went to the doctor on 04/07/2021 to have a medical assessment done as a part of requesting a renewal for C1's JV-220. FSW stated that a medical assessment was not completed but a medication management appointment was completed instead. FSW informed LPA C1's JV-220 expired 05/08/2021. FSW stated it takes approximately 30 days for a new JV-220 to be issued after the application is submitted along with the medical assessment. FSW stated C1 is scheduled for a medical assessment 06/03/2021, after which the renewal will be submitted to the court for approval. FSW stated a request was made to C1's doctor to obtain documentation that C1's medication was being administered without a current JV-220 due to an emergency situation but it was denied. FSW stated they have continued to issue C1 their medication despite not having a current JV-220 on file. FSW stated a CFT was conducted on 05/27/2021 to discuss attempting to have the request for a new JV-220 expedited by C1's attorney. C1's county social worker, C1's attorney and Placer County Public Health were present at the CFT.

S1 was talking to C1 as C1 was trying to leave the home. C1 turned around and called S1 a \"bitch\" and attempted to hit S1. S1 then attempted to place C1 in a Small Child Restraint. C1 confirmed S1 placed one hand on C1's shoulder and turned C1 around. C2 and S1 stated C1 let her body go limp during the restrain and went to the floor. Protocol was not followed as outlined in the Program Statement by staff which resulted in a youth being placed in an improper restraint. The Program Statement states \"Physical interventions will be employed when a child is in immediate danger of harming her/self or other and when other less restrictive interventions have failed, and a \"Restraint\" is defined as: The use of trained staff members to hold a young person to contain acute physical behavior\" the restrain was not executed properly which resulted in C1 going to the floor. Also, staff did not follow the Program Statement regarding \"Staff will first employ protective interventions (releases, deflections, proximity, and protective stance) when a child attempts to physical harm to staff or peers. Staff did not allow enough space between C1 therefore, the staff was not implementing proximity and a protective stance which resulted in a improperly restraint. The youth was restrained for behavior that did not present an imminent danger for injuring self or others which poses a potential Health, Safety, or Personal Rights risk to clients in care. As a result of the interviews conducted, documentation reviewed and investigation conducted, the allegation that staff improperly restrain youth is SUBSTANTIATED at this time meaning that the allegation is valid because the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met.

Staff was directed to leave because the hospital had a sit-in staff that remained with FY1. Staff stated that it was based on this reason that Staff presence was no longer required by the hospital. On 1/20/23, the Program Director provided the facility policy. The policy did not have any requirement that the staff should stay at the hospital with clients when they are taken for psychiatric treatment. LPA Ajaero was informed by LPA Michael Almaraz that during LPA's visit on 2/9/23, FY1 appeared to be under the influence and could not be interviewed by the LPA. On 2/2/2023, Reporting Party stated that at the time of FY1's evaluation, FY1 was attended to by a hospital sitter and that Hospitals in San Joaquin County have different protocols regarding if a legal guardian, referring to Facility staff, has to be present in the ER. Therefore, he could not firmly state whether the Staff was required or not. Additionally, reporting party stated that due to the emergent need for a mental health evaluation on the client, it was necessary to complete the evaluation without a legal guardian present. In addition, the Administrator denied any knowledge of any staff making inappropriate comments towards FY1. On 1/19/23, LPA interviewed the staff and they denied making the alleged statement. Lastly, LPA Ajaero made several attempts to interview FY1. FY1 is not available to respond to questions at this time because FY1 has been hospitalized with no definite day of release. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the alleged violations did or did not occur, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated.

LPA met with the Administrator, Gloria Losh, who assisted with the inspection. During the course of an Unsubstantiated complaint investigation, it was revealed that the facility did not follow proper Removal and/or Transfer regulations, as well as their Plan of Operation procedures. C1 was placed at this Facility on 9/10/24, and then was given a 14-day notice of removal two days later, on 9/12/24. The youth was transferred to another Facility on 9/20/24, due to the staff not being able to keep her safe because of her frequent AWOL'ing and dangerous behaviors while AWOL'ing such as accepting rides from strangers. On 10/23/24, LPA requested the youth's Child Family Team (CFT) meeting notes to discuss preservation of placement prior to being removed. Although Administrator Gloria Losh stated that C1's therapist did do an Individual Crisis Intervention Management Plan (ICMP) and clinical assessments, there was no CFT meeting held. On 10/28/24. Gloria Losh stated they made numerous attempts to schedule a CFT meeting, but was unable to reach C1's County Social Worker, or the Social Worker's Supervisor. Page H-2 of the Facility's Plan of Operation state, \"It is always the goal of EA to maintain the youth's placement when they are having difficulties with behavior or not meeting the Needs and Services Plan. Should a youth's placement be in jeopardy, the EA Social Worker will request an urgent or immediate CFT meeting to discuss the issues and develop action plans with the CFT, the youth and family to prevent possible transition.\" (Continued on LIC 809-C). The Facility's Plan of Operation also states that, 'EA has adopted a removal and discharge procedure in accordance with... Section 87068.4 of Community Care Licensing regulations'. Section 87068.4(e)(1)(E) states, 'Upon a concern that the facility cannot meet the needs of the child or when there is an indication that the placement may be disrupted, the licensee shall: Make a reasonable and good faith effort to engage in the development and implementation of placement preservation strategies in collaboration with the county placing agency and in consultation with the Child and Family Team'. On this date, the Agency is being cited for a violation of the Foster Family Agency Interim Licensing Standards, Version 6, Section 87068.4, Removal and/or Transfer Procedures. See 809-D page. An exit interview was conducted with the Administrator, Gloria Losh. A copy of this report and appeal rights were given.",

Confidential interviews revealed that during the child's two week stay, she had many physical altercations with another youth in care, and that staff had put hands on her once when attempting to prevent a physical fight between clients. An Incident Report (IR) was sent in by the facility on 9/12/24 describing an incident where S4 held C1's wrists for less than 20 seconds when she was going in to beat up another client and was also swinging at the staff member. Confidential interviews with staff revealed that C1 was threatening to hit C2 with a water bottle, so staff collected all water bottles in the facility, and locked them up to prevent this from happening. In an interview with C1, when asked about an incident with a water bottle, the youth stated that she was the one who tried to, \"hit C2 upside the head with a water bottle\". C1 stated, on another occasion, S1 told her to 'get out of the way' and pushed her. C1 stated S3 was a witness. S1 stated, no staff had ever pushed C1, and S3 stated she never saw anyone push C1 either, resulting in conflicting information. This Department has investigated the complaint alleging that the minor is being physically abused in care.

During the investigation there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegations. Although CCL received detailed information that S1 provided alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine products to clients in care during transportation services that were facilitated by S1, and that clients provided S1 with their allowances to buy these products. The information provided to the Investigator regarding these allegations was inconsistent. Confidential interviews deny the allegations while another confidential interview maintains that the allegations involving S1 are true. Confidential interviews further reported that facility staff inquired about these allegations with S1 prior to resignation and the allegations were denied. A confidential interview reported that when reviewing receipts of the client's allowances there was nothing suspicious observed that would indicate that allowances were spent on alcohol, marijuana, or nicotine products. There were no other known witnesses to the allegations and S1 could not be reached for comment. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegations that staff is providing alcohol to minors while in care, staff is providing marijuana to the minors while in care, staff is providing nicotine products to the minors while in care, and minors provided a staff member their allowance to buy nicotine products, may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred.

    "narrative": "On August 22, 2022, Community Care Licensing received a complaint alleging that staff speaks inappropriately to minors. Confidential interviews stated that no staff member at the STRTP has made any threats of killing a client. Confidential interviews did, however, admit that there was an incident that occurred involving S4 and Client 4 (C4). Confidential interviews further stated that S4 called \"C White trash\" and words were exchange between the staff member and C4. Confidential interviews also stated that the STRTP has a zero tolerance for such behaviors and have acted on those staff members behaviors. Other confidential interviews reported not witnessing staff members being inappropriate to clients. During record review LPA Urena found that the incident involving C4, and a S4 was documented by the STRTP. The documents that were collected are dated July 25, 2022, and July 26, 2022. All documents indicate that S4 did engage and exhibited inappropriate behaviors which resulted in S4 calling C4 \"White trash\". Based on confidential interviews and file reviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, and the allegation that S4 speaks inappropriately to C4 is supported and proven by evidence. The facility is cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Treatment Facility (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards Section 87072(c)(10) PERSONAL RIGHTS. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Facility Manager, Sydney Casillas On August 22, 2022, Community Care Licensing received a complaint alleging that the facility does not meet minors' dietary needs. More specifically, staff lock the pantry and do not provide bread or fruit to C1 after 8: PM. LPA obtained conflicting statements throughout the investigation. Confidential interviews revealed that the staff prepares three meals per day and snacks between each meal. Confidential interviews revealed that the pantry closes at 8: PM and the bread is locked, however, the clients are provided a couple of options; they can have the left-over food from that day or they can make a sandwich and the staff will provide the clients with the ingredients. Other confidential interviews revealed that the left-over food cooked by staff was left out and exposed to flies therefore some clients refused to eat the food. Confidential interviews revealed that the clients have complained about only having sandwiches for a late-night snack and that C1 wants special food and if C1 did not get what C1 wanted C1 ended up breaking into the pantry at the facility. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that the facility is not meeting minors' dietary needs, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Facility Manager, Sydney Casillas",

Additional confidential interviews and record review revealed the night of January 10, 2021, C1 did not sleep well and was up most of the night so the morning of January 11, 2021, C1 did not want to get up for school. Confidential interviews and record review revealed around 8:30-8:45 am, S3 and S6 were in C1's bedroom trying to get C1 to get up for school. Record review and confidential interviews revealed C1 was combative by kicking and hitting S3 and S6 during this time. Confidential interviews with S3 and S6 revealed they did not have to use physical force to get C1 out of bed but used verbal encouragement. Other confidential interviews revealed there was yelling and clapping heard from C1's bedroom while S3 and S6 were trying to get C1 out of bed. Confidential interviews revealed C1 eventually got up and went to the restroom where S3 and S6 assisted C1 with changing. Confidential interviews indicated S3 and S6 did not observe any marks or injuries to C1 at that time. Confidential interviews also indicated that after C1 changed and before going to school, C1 was jumping on the beds and couch in the facility as well as climbing over C1's dresser in C1's bedroom. Confidential interviews revealed at 9:00 am C1 then went to school at the facility campus cafeteria. Confidential interviews revealed around 9:30 am, S5 took C1 to the restroom and noticed a scratch and redness on C1's upper thigh. Other confidential interviews revealed no one was sure how C1 obtained the injury and no incidents resulting in an injury to C1 had been observed. Further confidential interviews revealed C1 is an active boy and plays on the swings and trampoline often. Further interviews revealed no staff had been observed to physically restrain or hold C1 in any way. AD also stated she checked the cameras at the facility and did not observe C1 to have had any incidents resulting in an injury that day.

    "narrative": "Interviews and record review revealed approximately 12-13 clients attend virtual schooling in the STRTP cafe through five different schools. Five clients attend the same school as C1 however do not have the same teacher. Confidential interviews and record review revealed clients have different schedules but a majority of the clients attend school Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 8:45 am and work until approximately 2 to 3 pm. Interviews and record review revealed that day shift staff schedules are from 6 am to 3 pm and the same staff are in the cafe with clients for the whole school day. Record review revealed approximately 20 messages sent from ST between August 2020 through February 2021 indicating students (referring to C1 as well as other non-client students) were not logged in for small groups or ST was waiting for students (referring to C1 and other non-client students) to join. Record review revealed these messages were all sent between 1:20 pm and 1:30 pm. Confidential interviews revealed these messages were sent out if students were not yet logged back in after lunch and as a reminder. Additional confidential interviews revealed C1 would come back from lunch around 1:30 pm and would join small groups making it possible for the messages to go out before C1 joined. Confidential interviews revealed C1 had no attendance issues during small groups with RT from 1:30 pm to 2:00 pm, although noted the small groups did start at 1:15 pm. Interviews revealed C1 was returning late from lunch due to all clients being lined up to return to the cafe together. Review of C1's report card showed 59 days present and 2 days absent in the first trimester and showed 61 days present and 0 days absent in the second trimester. Confidential interviews revealed attendance is taken in the morning and not again in the afternoons but is monitored by ST in the afternoons. Confidential interviews revealed that there have been times C1 has missed afternoon class or logged off early and record review revealed that two messages were sent indicating C1 not being logged on after 2 pm. Interviews revealed after 2 pm to approximately 3:30 pm is independent work time for C1. Interviews revealed that due to clients' disruptive and dangerous behaviors in the afternoon AD asked SP that students from C1's school be able to log off of school at 2 pm. Confidential interviews revealed that all clients in virtual schooling were logged off at 2 pm to manage clients' disruptive behaviors for approximately 3-4 weeks from February to March 2021. Other interviews revealed only students that were completed with their school work were logged off at 2 pm while others stayed until 3 or 3:30 pm to complete work. Further confidential interviews revealed C1 had missed some afternoon class due to C1 saying C1 was finished with school and C1 also made it appear C1 had no further work by deleting it or rushing through it. (Continued) Confidential interviews also revealed in the first trimester of virtual schooling it was difficult to keep track of all the client's differing schedules however staff are in communication with clients' teachers when issues arise. Based on record review, confidential interviews and conflicting statements of what occurred, the allegation facility staff do not ensure that youths attend school may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811 and appeal rights were explained and emailed to Administrator Christina Torres for signature.

The Investigator received inconsistent statements that supported a violation of neglect by staff during a restraint performed on C1 during a behavioral episode that posed a threat to C2 in care. Confidential interviews stated that staff members are trained in the usage of Professional Assault Crisis Training (Pro-ACT) and denied restraining C1 inappropriately during the incident in care. It was indicated that a restraint was used because C1 was choking C2 in care and after multiple verbal redirections by staff C1 refused to stop and staff intervened by using an appropriate Pro-ACT restraint on C1 during the incident. There were no other known witnesses to the allegation. Based on confidential interviews, and record review the allegation that staff inappropriately restrained C1 in care, may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. Exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report along with the appeal rights was provided to Director, Christina Torres.",

During investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that overnight staff do bedroom checks every fifteen minutes, but on the morning the client left the facility, bedroom checks were not conducted from 2:30AM-5:30AM according to documentation. In addition, confidential interviews disclosed that staff left the client's house for unclear reasons and clients were left unsupervised. A confidential interview stated that staff went to use the restroom while documents gathered indicated that staff went to do laundry. Multiple confidential interviews disclosed that when a client leaves the facility, staff would notice it right away and will follow AWOL protocol, however, a confidential interview and incident report corroborated that facility staff was not aware that the client AWOLed until law enforcement brought back C1 to the facility. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined staff did not ensure care and adequate supervision was provided resulting in C1's elopement. Therefore, this allegation is substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of the Interim Licensing Standards, 80078(a). An exit interview was conducted, appeal rights explained, and a copy of this report was provided to facility manger, Gloria Thomas.",

Another confidential interview disclosed that S1 was only deflecting C1 from throwing toys at S1, and C1 was already angled near the wall during the incident, however, S1 didn't intentionally put C1 against the wall. In addition, confidential interview disclosed that at no point did S1 restrain C1 due to S1 being the only staff on duty and S1 was not allowed to restrain by themselves. Another confidential interview disclosed that S1 grabbed C1 and threw C1 against the wall then pushed C1's head against the wall but there was no one around. Another confidential interview disclosed that they witnessed S1 restrain C1 against the wall and had C1's arm pressed against the wall.

    "narrative": "Documentation and confidential interviews confirmed that C1 did sustain a fracture to their left arm, however the injury was caused by C1 falling off their bike. The incident report submitted to the Department reported that on October 5, 2025, C1 was seen riding their bike when they crashed while attempting to make a turn. The report notes that several staff members were present and attended to C1's \"cuts and scrapes.\" However, at the time of the fall, it was not known that C1 had broken their arm as a confidential interview reported that C1 got back on the bike afterward. C1 was kept under staff supervision to monitor for any pain or swelling to their arm. The following day, staff transported C1 to urgent care where a fracture was confirmed. There were allegations that C2 caused C1's injury, as it was reported that on the same day of the fall, C2 kicked in C1's bedroom door, potentially further injuring C1's arm. However, confidential statements regarding this incident were inconsistent and did not establish that C2's actions caused the fracture. Regarding the claim that STRTP staff did not prevent bullying, multiple confidential interviews indicated that C1 and C2 were housed in the same dormitory, and C1 frequently provoked C2. It was also reported that, in addition to clients always being under staff supervision, staff routinely intervened during conflicts. Although C2 and other clients occasionally \"teased\" each other, staff members were present to redirect behaviors and de-escalate situations as much as possible. Additionally, statements about whether C2 coerced C1 or other clients into bringing C2 food were inconsistent. Based on confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegations that due to a lack of Supervision a minor (C1) sustained a fracture while in care and staff did not prevent minor (C2) from bullying another minor (C1) may have happened or be valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report, along with the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated October 11, 2024, and appeal rights, was explained and provided to Chief Executive Officer Christina Torres.",

The investigation was conducted by Special Investigator (Inv) Shawniece Poinsette of the Community Care Licensing (CCL) Investigations Bureau. The investigation included interviews the facility staff (S1-S4), clients in care (C1-C6), and the County Social Worker (CSW). On October 9, 2024, Community Care Licensing (CCL) received an allegation that due to a lack of supervision a minor (C1) sustained a fracture while in care and staff did not prevent minor (C2) from bullying another minor (C1). Specifically, there were concerns that the contentious relationship between C1 and C2 led to C2 purposely causing the injury to C1's left arm, as well as C1 bullying and coercing C2 and other clients in care.

In addition, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that when the physical altercation started staff attempted to separate C1 and C2 by placing themselves between C1 and C2 but C2 was still able to hit C1. Additionally, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that staff prevent altercations between clients by using verbal redirection and physically separating clients if needed. LPA received conflicting information. Regarding the allegation that staff made inappropriate comment towards minor, it was specifically reported that after a physical altercation between C1 and C2, a staff member at the facility told C1 \"if this incident occurs again, whatever has to happen will happen.\" It was reported that it was unknown what that staff member meant. During investigation, a confidential interview disclosed that what that staff member said, could have meant numerous things such as reporting it to the administrator, calling the police, etc. but it did not seem inappropriate. In addition, multiple confidential interviews disclosed that staff have never said anything inappropriate towards a client in general. Based on interviews, the allegations that staff did not prevent physical altercation between C1 and C2 and staff made inappropriate comment towards C1 may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violations, therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time.

Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Hamilton conducted a case management tele-inspection at Ferree's Group Home (GH) and met with Facility Manager Michael Barnett via Cisco Webex.

Confidential witness stated that S2 was laughing at C1 while C2 was striking C1 several times on the face and body. LPA was provided a video of the incident and in the video C1 is being attacked by C2. LPA observed in the video surveillance that S2 does not show a sense of urgency and does not attempt to redirect the clients. LPA observed C1 attacked twice once in the game room and another time outside the facility. During the attacks, S2 did not attempt to get C1 to a safe place or separate C1 from the attacker. Other confidential witness statements revealed that S2 walked over and attempted to stop the attack but C2 would not listen.

Another confidential interview stated there was communication between S1 and the driver picking C1 up. The confidential interview added S1 had to leave to pick other clients for appointment, however, the other driver was five minutes away when S1 left. LPA was unable to gather additional information regarding the time frame C1 was left unattended. Based on confidential interviews, the allegation that S1 left C1 unattended, may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support the alleged violation. Therefore, this allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. A copy of this report, LIC 811 and the appeal right was reviewed and provided to STRTP representative.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegation that staff did not ensure minor attended school, it was specified that the facility has allowed C1 to miss 52 days of school. During investigation, confidential interview stated that facility has many in-house incident reports about C1's lack of school attendance. It was added that C1 and other client would procrastinate then be late to school. Additionally, it was stated that the facility would make multiple trips to school so no client would be late due to others taking to long to get ready. Confidential interview stated staff would encourage clients to get ready earlier so they could arrive to school on time. Additional confidential interview stated that C1 would always be late to school by choice. It was added that staff would encourage C1 to be on time and explained the importance of being at school and on time. Another confidential interview stated that it was staff's fault C1 was late to school because staff would take C1 to school late. It was added that sometimes the staff would take too long and so C1 would refuse to go to school rather than be late. LPA received conflicting information. In regard to the allegation that staff did not ensure minor attended appointment, it was specifically alleged that C1 had driver's training and staff wouldn't get C1 up after informing staff about the appointment in the same morning. Confidential interviews disclosed that messages would be received over the weekend for appointments for the following day, but the problem was that only facility managers have access to the voicemail box. It was added that drivers training was never confirmed with staff. Additionally confidential interview stated that staff ensured they went to their appointments and got them there on time. Another confidential interview stated that C1's mother called and left a message over the weekend about drivers training but that the day of the training staff did not wake C1 up and C1 missed the appointment. LPA received conflicting information. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that staff did not ensure C1 attended school and staff did not ensure C1 attended appointment may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. Therefore, these allegations are unsubstantiated at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report was reviewed and provided to facility representative.",

    "narrative": "Regarding the allegations that staff did not provide a safe environment for children in care and staff conduct poses a risk to children in care, it was alleged that on January 29, 2025, the Facility Manager's ex-boyfriend tried to break into the STRTP to get to the Facility Manager. It was specifically alleged that clients in the home attempted to stop the male from trying to attack the Facility Manager. Furthermore, it was reported that the clients in care were all in the street fighting with the male, law enforcement was called out to the home, and no one was hurt. During the investigation, a confidential interview stated that Adult #1(A1) came inside the STRTP to fight a resident because the resident said something to the Facility Manager (FM) that A1 did not like while the FM was on the phone with A1 prior to A1's arrival to the STRTP. Another confidential interview stated not witnessing the incident, but it was reported that client #1(C1) saw A1 inside the STRTP assisting FM with FM's belongings and C1 was verbally aggressive to A1 because C1 wanted to start something with A1. The same interview stated that FM and A1 were already inside their car getting ready to leave when C1 opened their car door and started swinging at A1 and a fight broke out. One confidential interview stated that C1 was arguing with FM while FM was on the phone with A1. Then, A1 showed up to the STRTP and C1 was following A1 and FM to the car and C1 opened the door and A1 got out and A1 and C1 started to fight. One confidential interview stated that C1 was being verbally aggressive towards FM and when A1 picked up FM from FM's shift at the STRTP, C1 opened the driver's side door and assaulted A1. Then, A1 got out of the vehicle and responded while staff #2(S2) was assisting in blocking C1. The interview continued by stating that C1 got away from S2 and ran towards an opened field to grab a metal pipe and assaulted A1 with the metal pipe. The same interview reported that C1 was hit by A1 once during the physical altercation. An additional confidential interview reported that C1 had been harassing FM the entire morning during FM's shift and making threats to FM. The confidential interview continued stating that FM was leaving for the day and A1 was waiting for FM at the STRTP's front door. Then, C1 began to yell at A1 and A1 got upset and FM walked A1 to their car. C1 went around the house and opened A1's car door and began to assault A1. A1 got out the car and confronted C1. The interviewer tried to deescalate C1 and asked FM to walk A1 up the street; however, C1 got a hold of a metal pipe and hit A1 on the head. The interviewer stated C1, and A1 exchanged punches and law enforcement showed up. County social worker stated not having concerns on the safety in the STRTP because C1 was the aggressor. Based on confidential interviews and records review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met, therefore, the allegations that staff did not provide a safe environment for children in care and staff conduct poses a risk to children in care are substantiated at this time. The facility is being cited for the violation of Interim Licensing Standards 87078.2 (a)(3) Trauma Informed Interventions and Treatment Practices and 87065.2 (b)(1) Personnel Duties on the attached LIC 9099D. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report, LIC9099D, Appeal Rights, and LIC811 were provided to Facility Manager Tina Willis.",

It was additionally reported that C3 was heard name calling C1 during a phone conversation with C1. Furthermore, it was reported that C3 had threated to kill C1. During investigation, a confidential interview stated that C1 would antagonize the clients, and C1 would say C1 was going to take revenge on them by hurting them.

In regard to the allegations that staff member mismanaged minor's medications, and minor did not receive medications as prescribed, it was alleged that client #1(C1) had not received medications and staff were aware of the situation and were not putting any protective measures in place. A confidential interview stated that when C1 was placed at the STRTP C1 came with a bag of medications but without forms or instructions on the medications. The same interview stated that it appeared that the medication was old because C1 was on runaway status for a long time before being placed at the STRTP. Another confidential interview stated that when the STRTP finally received C1's JV220 and medications, C1 would refuse to take C1's medication because C1 would say that the medications would make C1 sleepy. One confidential interview stated C1 did not have a psychiatric appointment because C1 was placed at the STRTP for only a week. Other confidential interviews did not have information regarding the alleged violations. Based on confidential interviews, the allegations that staff do not prevent client #1 from being bullied by other minors while in care, staff did not provide a safe environment for client #1, and staff mismanaged client #1's medications, and client #1 did not receive medications as prescribed may have occurred, however, there was not a preponderance of evidence to support or deny the alleged violations.

The focused staff (FS) who was identified in the referral denied the allegation that he hit or handled a client in a rough manner on 06/17/2021, two other staff workers who were present corroborated the explanation and has denied any form of abuse towards the client(s). The FS explained after retrieving some contraband items from a client's bedroom, it was reported that the one focused client (FC) was agitated and was walking behind him in a very aggressive manner and believed that he was going to be attacked. The FS worker turn around and bumped into the focused client, causing the FC to loose his balance and fell on top of his bed. No injuries were reported. Interviews obtained by several staff workers denied the allegation and stated that clients at the facility are never mistreated. All staff workers commented that the FS worker is not that type of a person that would intentionally treat a client in a rough manner. In confidential interviews, the one focused client (FC) declined to provide a statement related the incident that occurred on 6/17/2021. Other clients when interviewed stated that they have no direct information to provide as one client was not present and the other clients stated \"I did not see anything and will not provide any information, including they could not recall the specifics of the alleged allegation. Statements provided by the clients interviewed stated they have no complaints about staff working at the facility. The assigned county social worker (CSW) for the one focused client (FC) does not believe the allegation and stated that the FC has a history of being defiant. The CSW has no concerns about staff working at the facility. The interviews revealed that there was some form of contact between one staff and one client that was described as being an accidental contact. However, statements obtained could not corroborate the allegation reported. Therefore, the above allegation is determined unsubstantiated at this time.

Additionally, on 6/17/2021 the department received another incident report regarding a child taking a bottle of unsecured cold medicine out of the manager's office. Facility manager stated the following: In regard to the incident report regarding child being raped and possibly killing someone the child stated they had consensual sex with a friend. They stated that they did not want to have sex with them but ended up doing it anyway. When staff was questioning child about what happened and inquiring details as to what transpired child made a statement of if I killed someone would you ask me all these questions. Facility manager stated that no specific information was given of friend who child had sex with or that child killed someone. The incident report with the cold medicine was my personal medication for relieving cough. I had the bottle out in the office. I stepped out of the office to ask a child a question and did not lock or close the door behind me. A child went into the manager's office and took my bottle of cold medicine and placed it in their pants. I was unable to retrieve the bottle as the child refused to give it back or take it from their pants. The cold medicine contained no alcohol and was an over the counter medication.

Staff members who were interviewed denied the allegation that clients are allowed to smoke in the facility, including activities outside of the facility grounds. LPA was informed by some staff members that at times they have caught client(s) smoking or vaping inside their bedroom while conducting routine checks and were able to confiscate the contraband and document the incident. Staff workers, including the Administrator, stated that staff are always present and are working professionally. In confidential interviews, all clients interviewed denied the allegation that staff working at the facility allowed them to smoke marijuana or any other form of tobacco or device such as a vape. Two clients denied that clients ever smoke at the facility and were not aware of others doing so. Other clients admitted smoking marijuana away from the facility. The other clients disclosed that they obtained the marijuana from other students at the school and were smoking on the school grounds. One individual identified as other reportedly disclosed that a client commented that staff knows and does nothing when they see clients smoking. Individual identified as other could not be contacted and therefore no statement was obtained. County Social Worker that was mentioned in the county referral could not be contacted, therefore no statement was obtained. When interviewed, the County Emergency Response Worker (ER) did not have any immediate concerns at that time. Statements obtained could not corroborate the allegation reported. Therefore, the above allegation of neglect/lack of supervision is determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. An exit interview was conducted and a copy of this report was provided to the facility representative for review and signature. No deficiencies were cited at this time",

We do not administer over the counter medications to the children, so we believe child is stealing the items from the store.

On December 31, 2022 the Department received a Special Incident Report regarding an incident that occurred at the facility on December 30, 2022. Upon review of the Special Incident Report, it was determined that due to the nature of the incident, a suspected child abuse report to the county hotline was warranted but not completed by the Licensee.

While conducting an assignment related to the above incident, it was also discovered that the Licensee was out of compliance regarding staffing regulations. In an interview conducted, the Facility Manager stated that their regular working hours were from 8: AM to 5: PM. A review of the facility's LIC Personnel Report indicated that the Facility Manager's working hours were between 8: AM to 4: PM. Interviews conducted with other staff and clients in the home confirmed that the Facility Manager's working hours were between 8: AM to 5: PM and that the facility was generally without a Facility Manager between the hours of 5: PM to 8: AM unless an emergency incident required their presence.

    "narrative": "It was alleged that in December of 2022, staff failed to properly supervise clients in care resulting in an unidentified, unauthorized female minor entering the facility undetected for an extended amount of time. During the course of this investigation, the female minor was not able to be located and was listed as a runaway. Therefore, an interview was unable to be obtained with her. In an interview conducted, one client stated that the unauthorized female minor (UFM) was snuck into the facility in the middle of the night towards the end of December 2022. The client stated that the UFM was brought in through a back bedroom window on the second floor of the facility. The client stated that prior to the UFM's unauthorized entry into the facility, security cameras had been covered with sticky notes and the bedroom window had been cracked open earlier in the day so that the sensor would not make an alert sound when it was later opened for UFM. The client stated that for the approximately 2 days that UFM was inside the facility, she was hidden from staff by hiding on the floor between a bedroom wall and bed. The only time she left the bedroom was to use the bathroom while staff were downstairs and performing other duties. Food was brought upstairs to her without the knowledge of staff. The client stated that staff generally conducted checks every 15 - 30 minutes and would come upstairs into their rooms to see if clients needed anything. However, the UFM was able to avoid detection each time. In another interview conducted, a second client corroborated the above statements and stated that all of the clients that were present in the facility during that time period were aware that UFM was in the home but no one alerted staff. The client also admitted that they actively assisted in covering up cameras on at least one occasion with sticky notes. A third client stated that they were initially unaware that UFM was present in the facility but also confirmed that they did not alert staff when they were finally aware. In interviews conducted, staff confirmed after checking security footage that the UFM was brought into the facility in the middle of the night through a second-story bedroom window. Footage also showed clients temporarily covering up security cameras with sticky notes in order to facilitate UFM sneaking into the home. Staff stated that when clients are upstairs in their rooms, staff members will check on them every 15-30 minutes to see what they are up to and if they need anything. This also occurs during overnight shifts when clients are asleep. Staff stated that during the period of time when this incident occurred, they would make regular checks but they did not see UFM as she would hide on the side of the bed closest to the wall and under blankets. In an interview conducted, a third-party individual stated that all indications pointed towards clients actively assisting the UFM in entering the facility and avoiding detection. It was also alleged that one client had access to a weapon in the facility. Further investigation revealed that the weapon in question was a CO BB gun. In an interview conducted, one client stated that it was brought into the facility unbeknownst to staff. A second client stated that they were unaware that the item was in the home until it was discovered and a third client stated that they were aware the first client had it in his possession, but decided not to alert staff to it. All clients stated that staff will ask to conduct searches when clients are returning from the community but stated that they sometimes refuse. Clients stated that room searches are conducted periodically by staff if there is reason to believe there may be contraband hidden. In interviews conducted, staff confirmed that they will ask to conduct light contraband searches on clients to include flipping out pockets, checking backpacks, having clients pat down their own pockets, and more. Clients will sometimes refuse, and when this occurs, staff will document the refusal. Staff stated that room searches are routinely conducted and the thoroughness of the check will depend on if there is a specific reason to believe that contraband may be hidden somewhere. Based on interviews conducted and records reviewed, there is not a preponderance of evidence to suggest that the above allegations occurred. Although the allegations may be valid or may have happened, the preponderance of evidence standard has not been met. Therefore, the allegations are deemed UNSUBSTANTIATED.

S1 stated it was a safety concern, and waited for the supervisor to arrive and handle the situation. S2 stated that C1 wanted to call his uncle, to come to the facility to assault staff. S2 stated that C1 had his own cell phone at the time of the incident and was purposely causing an unnecessary argument. S2 also stated staff safety was a concern.

    "narrative": "The LPA observed that the client was placed at the facility on March 5, 2020 and removed on September 30, 2021. The LPA observed an Appraisal/Needs and Services Plan dated October 1, 2020. The LPA observed that the County Placement Worker signed the document on January 20, 2021. The LPA observed a Quarterly Report dated September 17, 2021. The investigation revealed that the initial County Social Worker was no longer assigned the case. It is determined that the facility provided an Appraisal/Needs and Services Plan as required by the Plan of Operation. It is noted that the Appraisal/Needs and Services Plan is not within the 90 day plan, but consideration is given due to the Covid Pandemic. The LPA cannot corroborate that the facility did not provide paperwork. The investigation revealed that the facility was aware for two-to-three months of the plan to transfer Ref. #1 to an adult residential facility. It revealed that the facility had less than less than 24 hours to pack Ref. #1's belongings for the transfer once they received the call that a placement was open for Ref. #1. The LPA was provided inconsistent statements as to whether Ref. #1's belongings were provided in either a box or bags. It revealed that the witness stated a box, but no details were provided as to whether it was a moving box. The investigation revealed that the witness was concerned more with the lack of contents in the box as opposed to the container the belongings were transported in. The LPA cannot corroborate the allegation that Ref. #1's belongings were not provided. The LPA cannot corroborate evidence to determine if there was a Personal Rights violation based upon the type of container Ref. #1's belongings were transported. The LPA reviewed the Medical Treatment Record dated June 23, 2020 signed by the physician; and the Health and Education Passport dated February 16, 2021. The LPA cannot corroborate the allegation that the client was not taken to their medical appointment. Although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that alleged violations occurred, therefore the allegations are unsubstantiated. There are no deficiencies to be cited regarding these allegations. A copy of this complaint was provided to the facility representative.",

Manager stated that children who were roommates had a physical altercation where one child bit a child and the other child reacted to being bit by hitting the child. A bruise was not initially observed by staff but child had teeth mark impressions on their arm and child later developed bruising. Manager stated incident was documented and children were moved to separate rooms. LPA was unable to interview children as one child is non-verbal and other child refused to speak with LPA. LPA reviewed interviews and observations conducted by LPA Joshua Rareula on March 23, 2022 and April 21, 2022. LPA Rarela made observations of child who was non- verbal and received confirmation from his teachers that child is unable to speak or respond to questioning. In additional interviews conducted with other children made by LPA Rarela children had similar statements in identifying issues with one child but that all children got along with staff and that they had not observed or been victim to any staff be physically abusive to children. Documents reviewed coincide with statements received in how child obtained bruising. Staff reported incident to agencies reporting incident and addressed the issue by transitioning children to different rooms and intervening when necessary. Based on the information gathered, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was not met, therefore the allegation is unsubstantiated. An exit interview was conducted. A copy of this report Confidential Names Form, and Appeal Rights were provided to the facility representative.

Conflicting confidential interviews indicates that C1 would get in S1's face while living at the facility, and that S1 does not yell at clients or make them uncomfortable. Confidential interviews and a record review of special incident reports reveal that C1 became escalated during a therapy session with S2, leading to C1 punching out the kitchen window and being placed on a psychiatric hold. A confidential interview indicates that S2 was heard yelling back and forth with C1 during the therapy session and calling C1 a liar. A conflicting confidential interview indicates that S2 was using an assertive tone rather than yelling and was instructing C1 to leave their office for being vulgar and unruly. A confidential interview with C1 indicates that S2 treated C1 respectfully during the therapy session. Confidential interviews indicate that S2 is respectful towards clients during therapy sessions and has not been seen yelling at or calling clients names.

As a result, C1 took a step back, but the door did not hit C1. A confidential interview with C1 indicated that S1 did put their foot in the door, but the door did not hit C1. Other confidential interviews with witnesses present during the incident indicated that although S1 did push back on the door as C1 was closing it, C1 was not hit by the door and was not injured during or after the incident. During an inspection of C1's bedroom door, LPA Salem observed two medium-sized holes toward the bottom on the bedroom side of the door. Confidential interviews and a review of an incident report suggest that C1 barricaded themself in the bedroom after the back-and-forth with S1 by pushing the bed against the door, which may have caused the holes. Additionally, confidential interviews indicated that S1 is not perceived as aggressive or threatening toward clients when they are misbehaving or not following instructions. Based on confidential interviews and records reviewed, the allegation that Staff (S1) engaged in an inappropriate interaction with a youth (C1), resulting in the youth (C1) getting hit by a door is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

Confidential interviews revealed an incident in which C1 became upset with S1. Confidential interviews indicated that while C1 and other clients were being transported to school, S1 requested C1 to fill in open seats in the back of the facility van after C1 sat between two clients in the middle row, leaving minimal space between them. A confidential interview indicated that although there are no rules regarding client seating, C1 was asked to leave space after both clients sitting next to C1 complained about there not being enough room and to prevent clients from touching each other due to the lack of space. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 became upset and began to yell at S1. Confidential interviews revealed S1 asked C1 multiple times to stop their behavior due to C1 yelling. Confidential interviews revealed that S1 did not yell at C1 and was not disrespectful while addressing C1. Confidential interviews did not reveal any additional information on how S1 interacts with C1 or other clients in care, and due to C1 refusing an interview, LPA was unable to receive additional information regarding the way S1 treats C1. During the investigation a confidential interview revealed that C1 later expressed not wanting their video games taken away. Confidential interviews revealed that the facility wi-fi is disconnected from clients' personal devices as a form of consequence. Additionally, confidential interviews revealed that the disconnection from Wi-Fi prevents clients from playing games online. Confidential interviews revealed that all clients, including C1, are aware of this consequence. Additionally, confidential interviews revealed there was no specific time frame of how long these consequences can last however, confidential interviews revealed the length depends on the severity of the clients' actions. Confidential interviews did, however, reveal that in situations in which clients need to utilize the internet to complete homework or other important needs, facility staff will provide internet connection. A review of the facility's Program Statement revealed that when consequences are given to clients their privileges are limited. The program statement includes that appropriate forms of limiting privileges include, limiting radio, TV, and outings, however, there is no information on the disconnection of Wi-Fi. Continued...

It was reported C1 tried to explain the situation to S1 when S1 used profanity while responding to C1, causing C1 to feel uncomfortable. Confidential interviews and a review of pertinent facility records confirmed that on September 28, 2024, the facility hosted an outing to Mission Beach. Confidential interviews revealed all clients attended the outing which was supervised by S1 and S2. In addition, confidential interviews revealed that W1 also attended the event. A confidential interview and review of pertinent facility records revealed that during the outing, C1 and C2 engaged in an inappropriate conversation which led to C1 throwing sand at C2. A confidential interview and review of records confirmed that staff prompted both clients to stop, resulting in C1 becoming upset and punching C2. Confidential interviews and a review of pertinent facility records revealed that staff intervened by putting separation between clients and prompting both clients to stop, however, C1 proceeded to hit C2 a second time and C2 defended their self. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 was upset at staff intervening and was reported to be defiant in their behavior by arguing with staff. A confidential interview indicated that S1 used profanity when addressing C1, and one confidential interview confirmed that S1 used a profane word while in the proximity of C1. The confidential interview revealed that the word was said under S1's breath and was not directed at C1 or any other client. The confidential interview revealed that C1 mistakenly thought S1 told C1 to shut up and S1 clarified they did not. An attempt to complete an interview with S2 who was reported to be present during this interaction was unsuccessful.

On the call were the following: Community Care Licensing (CCL), Five Acres Staff, System of Care (SOC), Department of Mental Health Services (DMHC), and representative of Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). During the TA call, the following items were discussed: 1. The purpose of this TA call was to discuss SIRs; making sure staff are taking appropriate actions when LPA's conduct review. 2. Board Director's Meeting Notes - LPA Larios recently conducted a Law Enforcement (LE) inspection. LPA Larios reviewed the board of directors notes and noticed there was no evidence discussing LE contacts on SIRs. LPA Larios had a conversation and Jennifer Woolery will circle back and review the notes to make sure that was discussed and not missed during future meeting. 3. Program Statement - Updates needed to be based on newest version of STRTP ILS Version 3.1. - Section 17 of PS: Restitution program needs to be defined differently and not use restitution. Define it as clinical intervention, how it teaches other skills to clients in care, and go into detail of PS so it is a clearer picture. - Section 22 of PS: Needs to be more descriptive of how it is Trauma Informed and needs to be clear that it meets the needs of clients from 6-NMD. 4. Review of SIRs - SIRs need to include the following: 1) What happened before and triggered the restraint of client, 2) what happened during the restraint, and 3) debrief of the incident (Follow up). - If same child is being restrained time and time again, there needs to be progress notes and treatment plan needs to be discussed or changed. - Need to add time of incident. - Need to have more clinical staff present for incidents regarding restraints. If they are present then it needs to be noted in SIR. - Claudia Rice mentioned that there needs to be more training for staff on how to write SIRs. Making sure full story content is detailed in the SIR. - In regards to belt pivot, include description of belt pivot, purpose of it and how it is used. Address Emergency Intervention in section of PS and the types of restraints from least restrictive to more severe. Discussed bared wire on the roof. Facility staff have been keeping youth engaged in activities to deter them from going on the roof.

On the call were the following individuals: Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Lakescia Smith, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Alan Henry, Regional Manager (RM) Kellee Coleman, Claudia Rice Division Director and Tiffani Tran Division Director of Residential Programs. During the virtual tour the following items were discussed: 1. Clients having access to barbed wire on the roof. - A virtual tour was given of the barbed wire on the roof. Clients are able to access the barbed wire from climbing on the pillars which leads to the catwalk to have access to the roof. Although, Five Acres had tried various ways to limit children from accessing the roof, clients became creative and still found ways to access the roof. Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) has concerns with clients eventually seriously injuring themselves on the barbed wire located on the roof. Community Care Licensing (CCL) main concern with this is the health and safety for the youth in care. -Due to where the clinicians offices are located in the main building, clients are able to exit through the emergency exit and access the roof. RM Coleman requested pictures of campus where the barbed wire is located to have a better visual to assess the situation at hand. 2. Plan of Correction (POC) from October 2019 - A review of what was corrected from the Plan of Correction (POC) sent from Five Acres in October 2019. LPM Smith asked the following: Did Five Acres get permission to install barbed wire from CCL? Claudia Rice Division Director clarified that the barbed wire already existed on the roof and fence around the facility prior to POC in October 2019. Currently, there is barbed wire around the 10 foot fence that surrounds the campus and on the roof. After the virtual tour the following items were discussed to have a follow up regarding the barbed wire: - Five Acres collecting data to see how many injuries have occurred from the barbed wire on the roof. - Meeting with DCFS to discuss further action regarding clients getting injured from accessing the roof. - Brainstorming ideas to prevent clients from climbing on the roof where barbed wire is located. - Joint meeting with CCL, DCFS, and Five Acres to determine what will be done regarding the barbed wire on the roof.

On January 6, 2022 at 11:40am, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Daphne Edison made an unannounced visit to Five Acres and spoke with Administrator, Claudia Rice. The purpose of this visit was to deliver the findings for the above complaint allegations. During the course of the investigation, a total of four (4) clients and two (2) staff were interviewed. Interviews conducted confirmed there was not enough evidence to prove that a child was threatened by a staff member or staff member had another resident beat up child. Child 1 (C1) is known to be aggressive and has fought staff and clients when C1 was a resident at the facility. Staff 1 (S1) denied the allegations. S1 stated that C1 had fought a staff member and when a client saw, the client started to fight C1. S1 stated that C1 thought S1 had the client do so and apologized when realized it did not happen. County Social Worker (CSW) stated that C1 can be impulsive. Based on the interview information obtained and review of facility documentation, the allegation(s) are concluded as unsubstantiated meaning that although the allegation(s) may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. No deficiencies were observed or cited at the time of this investigation. Exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this report will be emailed to the Administrator.

The purpose of this visit was to deliver the findings for the above complaint allegations. During the investigation, LPA interviewed a total of three (3) staff and one (1) witness. LPA was unable to interview Client #1 (C1) who refused to participate in the interview process to discuss the allegations. Interviews conducted confirmed there was not enough evidence to prove that staff stepped on youth's hand, staff locked youth in a room, staff denied youth access to a restroom, and staff spoke inappropriately to youth. Video evidence reviewed by the LPA, confidential interviews conducted, and C1's refusal to discuss the allegations provided conflicting information that staff locked youth in a room. LPA observed the video footage which revealed that the door of the room in which C1 was located in does not have a lock and therefore allowing C1 to exit the room if necessary. Based on the interviews conducted, the video footage reviewed, and the information gathered, the allegation has been determined to be unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred.

    "narrative": "The matter was brought to the attention of Facility Administration and upon facility internal investigation, it was discovered that S1 was communicating with C1 via text message and Instagram. It was also discovered that S1 had purchased gifts for C1. When confronted by facility Administration, S1 denied buying gifts or texting C1; however, facility obtained proof to support the claims that S1 was communicating with C1 and had purchased gifts for C1. On May 26, 2021, S1 was terminated from employment for reasons including, but not limited to, having inappropriate unauthorized communication and purchasing various gifts for C1. The Department has investigated the complaint and found that the allegation is Unsubstantiated at this time meaning, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove sexual abuse by S1 on C1. There were no deficiencies cited at this time. The text messages contained messages alluding to inappropriate content by S1. It was further revealed that S1 had purchased various gifts for C1 that were against facility gift policy. An interview with S1 by CCL Investigator Seng revealed admission by S1 of sending text messages to C1 and purchasing various gifts for C1. Based on information obtained from interviews and documentary facts, the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. The Department has determined former staff member S1 engaged in inappropriate conduct with C1 while in care. The allegation is deemed substantiated at this time and thus poses potential Health, Safety or Personal Rights risk to children in care. The following citation is issued in accordance with the Health and Safety Code 1550(c) Conduct Inimical. An exit interview was conducted, and appeal rights were discussed. A copy of this report, Confidential Names List and appeal rights emailed to Facility Administrator Claudia Rice. (Continued on page LIC9099-D)",

LPA Martin met with Oscar Menendez, Crisis Intervention Specialist and advised that the Complaint Investigation investigated by Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD) Investigations Bureau, Investigator Dennis Seng has been completed. On June 10, 2021, CCLD received a complaint referral alleging sexual abuse on Child #1 (C1) as C1 reportedly sustained explicit relations/contacts with former Staff Member #1 (S1) [see LIC811, dated January 28, 2022]. It was further reported that S1 continued having inappropriate interaction with C1 after being terminated from the facility. The investigation including interviews and review of related reports from the Department of Children and Family Services and the County of Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Incident Report revealed a lack of evidence to support alleged sexual abuse by S1 on C1.

Confidential interviews also revealed that Client #1 (C1) did have a few scratches due to being \"hyper\" and also \"bumped\" their chin during play which could not be prevented. LPA review of video footage determined that C1 appears to be \"hyper\" and unable to control movements which could possibly result in injuries if not careful. LPA was unable to substantiate the allegation that staff failed to notify minor's authorized representative of incidents. Confidential interviews revealed that incidents are cross reported to all reporting agencies including C1's authorized representative. LPA was unable to substantiate the allegation that staff failed to safeguard minor's personal belongings. Although documentary evidence shows an inventory of C1's missing clothing items when C1 returned home from Five Acres, it did not reveal that staff failed to safeguard C1's personal belongings as it only reveals that clothing items can be lost, missing, or mixed up with other client belongings. It was also revealed that C1 would run out of the cottage with one shoe on which would result in a missing shoe. Confidential interviews did not reveal that staff did not meet C1's needs. Confidential interviews revealed that there was a misunderstanding by the parents of C1 of services being provided for C1. The parents of C1 were under the impression that staff would be providing a one-on-one for C1 and became upset with Five Acres with not being in agreement with what C1's diagnosis should be necessitating the need for C1 to have a one-on-one.

On 10/18/23, the Department received a Serious Incident Report (SIR) from the facility, reporting that a minor, C1, was not provided with prescribed medication due to staff being unable to locate medications. Missing medication was found during the next day and it was determined that LVN2 misplaced medication and did not follow facility policy for storing meds upon a client's return from a visit home. During the time of inspection, LPA O'Connell conducted investigative interviews with DD, LVN1, S1, S2, C2, and C3 [See LIC811, dated 10/26/23, for CONFIDENTIAL NAMES LIST]. Confidential interviews revealed that staff did not follow the facility policy to store medications after a client returns from a home visit. Further, it was determined that the facility does not have a clear documentation procedure related to tracking missed medication.

    "narrative": "Statements indicate that on the day of the incident, staff conducted a room check of the bedroom that Client #1 (C1) and Client #3 (C3) share. Statements indicate room checks consist of staff searching under clients' beds and searching client closet in the bedroom. Statements indicated that during the room check, staff discovered Client #2 (C2) hiding in the closet. Consistent statements indicated that Client #2 (C2) was previously placed at Five Acres (Solita) but was no longer in placement. Documentary evidence indicate C AWOL'd from current placement. LPA obtained Special Incident Report (SIR) #844753. Statements indicate C2 returned to Five Acres (Solita) with C1. Statements indicate that C2 climbed through the bedroom window which was left open. Statements indicated C1 had returned from AWOL and Pasadena Police Department was present at the facility when C2 was found by staff in the bedroom. Statements did not indicate facility staff are not adequately supervising minors. Documentary evidence indicates adequate direct care staff and client ratio on the date of the incident. LPA obtained email documentation from Division Director of staff schedule dated 2/17/2023-2/19/2023. Division Director stated that there is no paper documentation of staff schedule for the requested dates. LPA also obtained documentary evidence: Special Incident Reports (SIR), and Pasadena Police Report. LPA reviewed video footage of the exterior of the facility on the date of the incident. LPA observed C2 knock on the bedroom window. LPA observed someone opening the bedroom window and C2 climbed through the window. LPA was unable to identify who opened the window. Based on the interviews conducted, documentary evidence and LPA video footage review, the information gathered did not produce corroborating evidence to support the above said allegations. LPA was not able to determine if the above said allegations occurred, therefore the allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated, meaning that although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred. Based on the observations made during today's inspection, no deficiencies were cited per Title 22, Division 6, of the California Code of Regulations.

Additional confidential interviews revealed C1 had a history of medication refusal. LPA obtained a copy of C1's medication log and Needs and Services Plan.

LPA obtained Five Acres policy on client medication. Inconsistent statements and documentary evidence did not corroborate C1 had visible marks or bruises on their neck.

Facility staff called 911 immediately upon occurrence and Y1was sent to the hospital for treatment. Information reviewed revealed no documentation of any suspicion of child abuse within the Medical Records. On June 19, 2024, Y1 sustained an injury (bruise on his genital area). Records reviewed revealed youth sustained the injury during an outing at the local park while riding their bike. Facility nurses completed an assessment of client's genital area after the incident. Client observed with bruising to scrotum area. Youth was offered an ice pack however client declined. Confidential interviews and review of documentary evidence including client file history produced a lack of evidence to prove allegations that staff physically abused Y1, resulting in severe injury or that staff did not prevent minor from being harmed by another minor. Evidence obtained was not sufficient to substantiate the allegations. Therefore, the allegations are determined Unsubstantiated. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

LPA reviewed several Unusual Incident Reports to confirm that the staff's effort to meet the needs of the children, by using crisis communication to encourage the children to make better choices. Staff provided counseling based on the individual Safety Plan. LPA also reviewed Law Enforcement Contact reports to confirm that youth that returned from AWOL were to adhere to the self-search; asked to engage in contraband check (i.e empty pockets and conducted random room searches), and no items were found. AWOL Protocol and procedure were implemented in addition to what is indicated in the facilities Page: Emergency Response and Intervention, Runaway plan. LPA assessed that all statements were congruent with the method of interventions implemented to ensure that the facility provided proper supervision to support that met the needs of children in placement; In addition, no disclosure or reports indicate that drugs were illicit. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred.

There was no needs and services plan for the victim (C1) because she had only been at the facility for four days prior to the overdosing incident. The interviews and reports yielded conflicting information regarding the source of the pills on which C1 overdosed and also whether or not Staff 1 intervened when the other clients were fighting with and bullying C1.

    "narrative": "Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Olivia Rosas conducted a case management inspection July 23, 2025, at 9:30am based on the number of relevant law enforcement contacts reported by the facility, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1538.7. During this inspection, 5 out of Direct Care Staff and 4 out of 4 youth files were reviewed. In the inspection, 3 out of Direct Care Staff and 1 out of 4 youth were interviewed (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated July 23, 2025). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the youth sase plans, Crisis Safety Plan,Child and Family Team summary, Needs and Service Plan (LIC625), the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Rosas observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance with their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Tessa Koziol, Administrator.",

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews mentioned an incident where C1 became upset with behavior escalating into self-harm and property destruction. During the incident C1 went outside of a cottage located at the facility and with a rock began to make scratches on their forearm. Confidential interviews revealed that C1 then attempted to reenter the cottage but was not allowed entrance into the cottage by staff members assigned to work in the cottage. Confidential interviews indicated that C1 became more upset when staff would not allow C1 entrance back into the cottage, so C1 threw a rock at the cottage glass window. Resulting in the breaking/shattering of the window. While C1 remained outside and not being allowed entry into the cottage, C1 picked up some broken glass, and began to cut their forearm with the shards of glass, while staff remained inside the cottage. Information provided indicated that staff contributed to C1 becoming unable to de-escalate and manage the self-harming behavior by remaining inside the cottage and not opening the entrance door, when C1 was attempting to re-enter the facility. Confidential interviews indicated that staff remained inside the cottage while using crisis communication through the window. LPA did not receive information regarding staff implementing a safety plan, following C1's needs and service plan, attending to C1's wounds, nor providing guidance to a safe area away from the broken glass. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegations that due to neglect, C1 sustained injuries while in care, staff did not prevent C1 from self-harming, staff are not properly supervising minors while in care, and staff did not provide a safe and comfortable environment for minors are SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met. This poses an immediate Health, Safety, or Personal Rights risk to children in care, the facility will be cited for violating Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) Version 4, STRTP, Article 06. 87065.2(b)(1) Personnel Duties and Welfare and Institutions Code section 16001.9(a)(1) Personal Rights.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews disclosed C1 and C2 had a \"crush\" on each other. It was also stated during confidential interviews that C1 and C2 liked each other, and staff often had to separate them. Confidential interview indicated C1 and C2 resided in different cottages and, on one occasion, C1 was caught by staff going into C2's bedroom through the window after hours. Confidential interviews revealed C1 and C2 often disabled the window alarms by removing the battery from the alarm or removing the alarm from the window. Record review indicated windows were often replaced due to clients breaking them; however, the window alarms were not maintained, although interviews indicated that staff were aware that clients disabled or removed alarms. Record review indicated C1 and C2 interacted sexually on at least two occasions while in C1's bedroom. Record review indicated C2 admitted to having sex with C1 and being in a relationship with C1 when they were placed at the facility. The Department received consistent information regarding C1 and C2 having a sexual interaction while they were placed at the facility due to disabling the window alarms and staff not conducting frequent status checks on the clients. Based on confidential interviews and record reviews, the allegation that due to lack of care and supervision, minors engaged in inappropriate sexual activity while in care is SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence has been met. This posed immediate Health, Safety, and Personal Rights risks to children in care. The facility will be cited for violating Title 22. Division 6, Chapter 1, Article 06. Continuing Requirements, Section 80078(a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision [See LIC 9099D]. An Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP) determination is pending. If an ECP is assessed, a Community Care Licensing representative will return to the facility to deliver the penalty assessment. An exit interview was conducted, and Plan of Correction was developed with Roland Williams, Administrator. A copy of this signed report, LIC 9099D and appeal rights were provided to Roland Williams, Administrator.",

    "narrative": "On January 10, 2025, at 10: AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Lucero Jauregui met with Erica Rowan, Residential Supervisor, of Fred Finch Youth Center-San Diego to assess an Enhanced Civil Penalty (ECP). On November 6, 2024, LPA Jauregui delivered an amended Complaint Investigation Report to the facility. The allegation that due to lack of care and supervision, minors engaged in inappropriate sexual activity while in care was substantiated. The investigation provided sufficient evidence that the minors engaged in inappropriate sexual activity on two occasions due to lack of supervision. The licensee was cited from Title Regulations, Section Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision (a) The licensee shall provide care and supervision as necessary to meet the client's needs. Based on an analysis of the confidential interviews and documentation, the Department has determined that an ECP is warranted for the facility not ensuring that C1 and C2 were provided sufficient supervision to prevent C2 from entering C1's room and engaging in inappropriate sexual activity. Penal Code section 11165.1 defines sexual abuse as involuntary sexual penetration. Therefore, pursuant to the Enhanced Civil Penalty Law, Health, and Safety Code section 1548(f)(1)(C), the Department will be issuing an immediate Civil Penalty of $2,500.00. An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights were discussed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List, and the Civil Penalty Assessment-Serious Bodily Injury/Sexual Abuse (Form 421-D) were provided to Erica Rowan, Residential Supervisor.

PLANS OF CORRECTION (POCs) The licensing agency is required to establish a reasonable length of time to correct a deficiency. In order to set the time, the licensing agency must take into consideration the seriousness of the violation, the number of persons in care involved, and the availability of equipment and personnel necessary to correct the violation. Applicants/licensees are requested to provide a specific plan for each violation on the right side of the form across from each deficiency. The more specific the plan, the less chance exists for any misunderstanding in setting time limits and reviewing corrections. The applicant/licensee who encounters problems beyond their control in completing the corrections within the specified time frame may request and may be granted an extension of the correction due date by the licensing agency. CORRECTION NOTIFICATION The applicant/licensee is responsible for completing all corrections and promptly notifying the licensing agency of corrections.

    "narrative": ". It was reported that staff forcefully grabbed C1 making C1 go outside and pushed C1 to the ground. It was also reported that C1 had a small laceration on their hand. It was further reported that Staff 4 (S4) frequently harms other youth. Confidential interviews and record review indicated that on January 12, 2025, C1 began attacking S4 with closed fists. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated C1 made threats towards staff and engaged in property destruction. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated C1 broke plexiglass from a cottage window and used a shard of plexiglass to damage S4's vehicle. Confidential interviews indicated, in response, S4 followed approved ProAct protocol by remaining inside the cottage while C1 was outside. Confidential interviews and records reviewed indicated C1 continued to engage in property destruction resulting in C1 getting admitted on a psychiatric hold. Confidential interviews indicated C1 was discharged the following day and S2 and S3 went to pick C1 up. Confidential interviews indicated upon arrival to pick up C1, C1 was not being compliant with communicating with S2 and S3 about safely returning to the facility. Confidential interviews indicated S2 and S3 walked C1 to the facility vehicle where C1 demonstrated unsafe behavior by mumbling that they weren't going to be safe and throwing items inside the vehicle and towards S3. Confidential interviews indicated C1 got out of the facility vehicle and began attacking and making threats towards S3. Confidential interviews indicated S2 and S3 were verbally redirecting C1. Confidential interviews indicated S2 and S3 went inside for their safety and C1 followed continuing to attack S3. Confidential interviews indicated C1 engaged in property destruction inside the unit, breaking a pamphlet holder. Confidential interviews indicated C1 picked up a shard to harm S3; however, emergency unit staff stepped in and re-admitted C1. Confidential interviews indicated S4 is dependable, has a good relationship with clients, and is clients' preferred staff. Confidential interviews denied facility staff forcefully handling C1 in a rough manner. Based on confidential interviews and a lack of evidence to corroborate the allegation, the allegation is unsubstantiated. The allegation may have happened or is valid, but there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged violation occurred. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of this signed report and appeal rights were provided to Roland Williams, Program Administrator.",

The purpose of the inspection was to complete the continuation inspection for STRTP annual inspection that was initiated on June 22, 2021. LPA already completed the physical inspection of the facility and reviewed facility client files on the first day of the annual inspection. During this annual inspection continuation, LPA Escobar reviewed ten personnel files to ensure they contained all required documentation per Title Regulations and Interim Licensing Standards (ILS). Personnel Files are usually maintained in a locked closet by the front door. All appropriate personnel who require caregiver background checks have received criminal record and child abuse index check clearances or exemptions. Ten of the ten files that were reviewed were for employees who converted from group home personnel to STRTP personnel. LPA observed the converted staff members were trained according to the STRTP training requirements. Files for staff 5 (S5) and staff 8 (S8) did not have a copy of driver's license. Staff 1 (S1), staff 2 (S2), and staff 10 (S10) did not have proof of TB test. S10 and staff 7 (S7) files did not have education verification. S5 and staff 6 (S6) did not have signed employee rights. S1, S2, and S10, did not have updated job descriptions. S5 and S6 did not have job descriptions. S8 and S10 did not have current job evaluations and S7 did not have one in file. S2, and S4-S10 did not have employer verification form in files. S3 file does not have copy of fingerprint clearance in file. Technical Assistance Advisory Note will be issued for personnel files. Administrator R'Nisha Parker is present at the facility a minimum of 20 hours a week, as verified by staff schedule and interviews.

LPA discussed the following with the facility manager: incident reporting, including incidents related to Assembly Bill 388 law enforcement contacts as well as incidents involving emergency interventions. LPA discussed procedures for Child and Family Team (CFT) meetings, including an overview of required Core Services and Supports. Based upon the inspection of facility records and interviews with staff and clients, the Licensee appears to be meeting CFT and Core Services/Supports requirements. Two youth counselors (direct care staff) and one facility manager present during annual inspection were interviewed in regard to their job duties, training, and services provided at the facility. All staff were able to provide sufficient information in relation to the facility's program. Staff have no issues or concerns regarding the facility. Based upon the inspection of facility records and interviews with staff and clients, the Licensee appears to be meeting CFT and Core Services/Supports requirements. LPA requested the recent board meeting minutes be provided via email by June 28, 2021. Additionally, Facility has cameras in common areas of the facility. The facility has an exception on file to use the cameras and are meeting the terms and conditions.

    "narrative": "On June 22, 2021 at 9: AM, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Carmen Escobar arrived at Future Stars Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP). LPA was greeted and granted access by Ms. Ronnie Lusk. The purpose of the visit is to conduct an annual inspection of the facility. There were two staff and five clients present at the time of the inspection. Appropriate staff/client ratios were verified during the inspection, however, no facility manager was on site at the time of the inspection. The facility is being cited under Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards chapter section 87065, Personnel Requirements.

The facility consists of three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The facility has a small dining area, kitchen area, living room, open common area, laundry room, and a garage. The facility has a clinician's office for therapeutic services. Staff areas are located in the open common area as well as a corner of the main living room. All bedrooms have individual beds and drawer space for each client. The facility ensures that there is one client per bed with appropriate linens, pillows, comforters, and mattresses in good repair. Facility grounds are clean and free of debris and observable hazards. During the inspection, it was observed that the basketball hoop in the backyard has fallen over and is on the ground, creating a potential hazard. It was also observed that the outside of the garage wall has white graffiti/markings that need to be painted over. There is adequate indoor and outdoor activity space. Books, crafts, movies, and other activities, were observed for client's recreation time. The client's bedroom windows were also missing screens. Carbon monoxide detector is in appropriate working order, and per staff, all facility smoke detectors are also in working order, however, this could not be verified as fire system is hard-wired into the home with standard fire alarms and fire alarm handles available for use during an emergency. Fire extinguisher is properly charged and serviced. The facility maintains an adequate supply of perishable and non-perishable foods and appears to be following the posted menu. All required forms are posted including the Grievance Procedures, Visitation Policies, Personal Rights form, and Foster Care Ombudsman poster. There was no activities calendar posted in the facility.

While two witnesses maintain this is true, S1 denies calling C1 \"bitch\" and also denies threatening C1. Confidential interviews revealed a verbal altercation occurred between S1 and C1 at the facility. A couple of witnesses report hearing S1 call C1 a \"bitch\" and also verbally threaten C1, saying something along the lines of, \"You must not know who you're talking to. I'm about to slap those glasses off your face!\" and \"Shut the fuck up before I choke you!\" to C1 during verbal altercation between S1 and C1. A witness maintains this was said by S1 as S1 was about 1-2 inches from C1's face. Another party states though they did not visually witness this occur, they heard S1's comments and remarks which corroborate what was reported. A couple of witness observed C1 being emotionally distraught due to the verbal altercation involving S1 and what was allegedly said by S1. S1 denies getting loud or yelling at C1. Several other statements corroborate this did occur. S1 was unable to articulate what trauma informed care/service was provided to C1 during this incident, S1 simply denied both allegations. Based on interviews conducted and information obtained, the allegations that S1 spoke inappropriately to C1 and S1 threatened C1 are SUBSTANTIATED because the preponderance of evidence standard has been met for the allegations. This poses a potential health, safety, or personal rights risk to clients in care. The facility is being cited under Interim Licensing Standards section Personal Rights.

Staff did not provide transportation to a minor (C1), resulting in the minor (C1) being left at the hospital. Therefore, the allegation is substantiated. The Department has determined that the licensee did not follow their program statement, specifically the terms regarding the transportation arrangements for clients in care. The facility is cited for violation of California Code of Regulations Title 22, Division Plan of Operation, 80022(a)(b)(10)(k).

The department also received an allegation that staff (S1) had inappropriate conversations with a minor (C2), and staff did not safeguard a minor's (C2) personal belongings. It was reported that C4 took C2's cell phone and found phone calls between S1 and C2. More specifically, it was alleged that the phone calls between S1 and C2 were exchanged outside of S1's regular working hours. A confidential interview witness interview reported C4 found text messages exchanged between S1 and C2. The confidential witness did not see the text messages and learned, second hand, from C4 that S1 offered C2 money to spy on other clients and a STRTP staff. LPA received inconsistent information to support the alleged misconduct. Although it was reported that S1 had inappropriate phone conversations with C2, LPA did not obtain additional statements from those who saw the text messages or witnessed the phone calls between S1 and C2. Other confidential interviews either denied the allegation or denied having any knowledge of S1 contacting C2 or other clients after hours to spy on clients and staff. In addition, confidential interviews disclosed that C1 did have S2's phone number. However, conversations between C1 and S2 were not inappropriate. C2 only contacted S1 when C2's roommate was \"upset,\" or other clients were \"out of control.\" Information from confidential interviews also reported that S2 was a good employee, and there were no concerns about S1's interaction with clients. Regarding the allegation, the staff did not safeguard C2's belongings, and LPA again received conflicting information to prove the allegation. A confidential interview denied that C2's cell phone was taken by C4 or any other clients in care. Another confidential interview reported that clients stole from each other but did not recall the alleged theft of C2's cell phone. Other confidential interviews reported clients could keep their items in the staff office and had access to personal lockers to store their property. Furthermore, a confidential interview reported that at the time C2 was in care, there were no reports of theft. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews, the allegations Staff (S2) yelled at minor (C3), staff (S1) had inappropriate conversations with minor (C2), and staff did not safeguard minors (C2's) personal belongings are unsubstantiated.

The purpose of the visit was to follow-up an incident reported to the Department on 08/18/2022 regarding a client (C1) who disclosed to facility staff that she snorted the medication administered to her on the night of 08/13/22. C1 also disclosed that she deliberately hid her medication between her lips and teeth, and then passed on the medication to another client C2 who admitted to snorting the medication on the night of 08/14/22 (see Confidential Names List LIC811 dated 09/09/22). During the inspection, LPA Silva conducted a tour of the facility, interviewed Head of Service regarding medication administration procedure, and reviewed clients' medication vs. medication records. LPA also interviewed four (4) staff members via telephone prior to today's inspection. All five (5) staff members confirmed that the facility's protocol on medication administration is that clients take their medications in staff's presence and that clients cough, blow and hold open their mouth and lift their tongue to ensure that medication was taken and swallowed. Based on interviews, staff S1 followed correct medication administration procedure. Staff is unsure of how C1 managed to hide and not swallow the medications she took on the nights of 08/13/22 and 08/14/22. Interviews with staff indicated that all staff who assist clients in medication administration received the proper medication training. Staff training on medication is given during initial training and is also part of their annual and in-service training. Interviews also indicated that additional training was given to staff members after the incident to ensure careful medication distribution and to prevent similar incidents from occurring.

Confidential interviews reveal that an emergency CFT Meeting was held on 10/3/22 to preserve client's placement. Client was in attendance and the emergency CFT meeting notes state in part that, \"the identified client continues to meet criteria for placement in an STRTP and the level of care provided.\" However, a 14-day notice of request for removal was submitted by the facility on the same day, without client's knowledge. Staff explained that client was not informed of the removal request for client's own safety and that it's the policy of the facility not to inform clients of any planned removal for safety reasons. Staff explained that client was unable to commit to safety. There was no record found of any incident or safety issues involving the client during and after the CFT meeting to indicate the need for a removal request. There was no record found that the removal request was discussed with the client. The client's NSP was not updated prior to the removal request. There was no record found showing that the client was offered an opportunity in the development of any transfer plan. The client became aware of the removal request after being informed by the client's legal team during a scheduled court hearing. The client's legal team informed staff of the need to speak to the client prior to the scheduled court hearing. The client's legal team made several attempts to speak to the client, by phone calls and emails to staff, before and after the client's court date. All attempts to speak to the client, through staff and the facility, were unsuccessful. There was no record found that client refused to speak to the legal team.

Confidential interviews also revealed that all clients' needs are being met and clients are taken to shop for necessities. Confidential interviews disclosed to LPA that the facility is cleaned daily, deep cleaning is done on Fridays and Saturdays and facility does not have an issue with cleanliness.

Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Canal observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident.

The internal investigation noted staff (S1-S3) violated the facility policy regarding \"appropriate supervision of youth\" and failed to submit a Special Incident Report. Furthermore, a confidential interview reported that S1's employment was terminated when another client at the other facility located at Middlebrook Way, Moreno Valley, CA 92555, alleged and later recanted that S1 provided clients with pills and marijuana.

    "narrative": "However, C1's CSW and CCL were not notified within 24 hours of the incident as regulated in Title 22. Confidential interviews and document review revealed that C1's CSW was made aware of the incident 12/10/2020 via an outside party and CCL was notified on 12/11/2020 when the allegations were received via a complaint report. In addition, the Special Incident Report (SIR) dated 12/08/2020 regarding C3's attempted suicide was not sent to C1's CSW and LPA Hamilton until 12/15/2020. Administrator stated that she was aware of the client being 5150'd on 12/08/2020 but was not aware that it was due to client attempting suicide. The Administrator did not learn of the attempted suicide until C3's IEP meeting on 12/08/2020 at 2pm. Administrator also stated the SIR was completed on 12/08/2020 but she was not included on the email and the SIR had only been sent to the acting facility manager after the incident. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined that the staff did not properly report an incident involving C3. The allegation is therefore substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article Section 80061(b)(1)(E): Reporting Requirements. The facility failed to report to CCL and C1's CSW/authorized representative an incident of self-harming within the timeframes outlined in Title Regulations. This poses immediate and potential health, safety or personal rights risk to children in care. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided via email to Administrator Shugella Weaver-Thomas for signature. The original signed report will be placed in the facility file. Confidential interviews disclosed that S2 was informed of C3 attempting suicide and S2 did nothing; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that another client was able to intervene and stop C3 from harming themselves prior to S2 intervening. Confidential interviews revealed additional conflicting information stating that S2 was upstairs as C3 was attempting to harm self; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed that S2 was downstairs. A Confidential interview disclosed that S2 was in the upstairs restroom at the time of the incident tending to an injury and another client was able to remove the curtain from around C3's neck just prior to S2 entering the bedroom. Confidential interviews disclosed that once S2 was in the bedroom, S2 was briefed by the other clients as to what had transpired with C3. Confidential interviews disclosed that S2 did call 9-1-1 as well as another client in the facility. Document review disclosed that S2 did not witness C3 with anything around C3's neck. CSWs had no issues or concerns with the care and supervision provided at the facility. Based on confidential interviews and document review, the allegation that S2 did not protect C3 from harm while in care, may have occurred, however is not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegation is unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were emailed to Administrator, Shugella Weaver-Thomas for signature.

Licensing Program Analyst (LPA), Cindy Hamilton conducted a case management tele-inspection for Guiding Light Home for Boys #2 (STRTP) and met with Administrator Shugella Weaver-Thomas via Facetime. Due to COVID-19 a tele-inspection was conducted. The purpose of the inspection was to address issues and concerns regarding incidents that occurred on or around October 28, 2020 and December 15, 2020. It was discovered through information received via confidential interviews that Client #1 (C1) was pushed by Staff #4 (S4) at the STRTP on 10/28/2020 when C1 became upset because S4 did not allow C1 to cook food at 1: AM. C1 began to destroy items in the STRTP. It was reported that S4 observed C1 heading towards the fire extinguisher, S4 jumped in front of the fire extinguisher and pushed the side of C1's shoulder. S4 pushed C1 to prevent C1 from retrieving the facility's fire extinguisher. The facility is being cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1 (09/16/2020), Section 87072(d)(10) Personal Rights. Per confidential interviews, S4 pushed C1. This poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk to children in care. It was further discovered through confidential interviews that on 12/15/2020, the facility was out of ratio. It was reported that on this date at 3: PM, there were two staff on duty at the STRTP with six clients. One staff left the facility with one client going to the hospital at 3: PM. This staff did not return to the facility until 7: PM and left again at 8:55PM to go back to the hospital to supervise C1. During the time the staff was away from the facility, the facility was not operating within the direct care staff/child ratio as stated in the STRTP Interim Licensing Standards. One staff was left to supervise and manage four clients between the hours of 6: PM to 7: PM and five clients from 8: PM - 10: PM. Therefore, the STRTP is being cited for violation of Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1 (09/16/2020), Section 87065.5 (a)(1) Direct Care Staff/Child Ratios.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews also confirmed that the door was nailed shut because the licensee did not want clients out on the balcony due to a possible liability to the facility. Confidential interviews also disclosed that the balcony was stable but there was a possibility someone could get hurt. LPA observed pictures of facility maintenance removing the screw from the track of the sliding glass door on 03/10/2021 and the door being opened. In addition, LPA conducted a health and safety tele-inspection via Microsoft Teams on 03/18/2021 and staff demonstrated that the sliding glass door in the master bedroom was able to be opened and closed. Based on confidential interviews, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined that the facility did not ensure the sliding glass door in C1's bedroom was free from obstruction. The allegation is therefore substantiated. The facility is being cited for violation of Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 1, Article Section 80087(c): Building and Grounds: All outdoor and indoor passageways, stairways, inclines, ramps, open porches and other areas of potential hazard shall be kept free of obstruction. This poses immediate and potential health, safety or personal rights risk to children in care. An exit interview was completed and a copy of this report and appeal rights were provided to facility manager. In regard to the allegation that the facility lacks sufficient food for clients, on 03/05/2021 it was alleged that the facility only had butter and condiments in the refrigerator and frozen corndogs and banquet meals for weekend staff in the overflow freezer. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that the facility did not lack food and there were additional refrigerators and freezers full of food; whereas another confidential interview disclosed the facility did lack food sometimes. Confidential interviews also disclosed to LPA that the facility would advise ADM when food was low, ADM would do an Insta-Cart order and food would be delivered in approximately one to two days. Confidential interviews also disclosed that the facility also had an overflow refrigerator and freezer at Site 1, located at Saffron Cir, Moreno Valley, CA 92555 due to that site having more space for the extra refrigerators and freezers. LPA observed pictures were taken at the facility showing the refrigerators and cabinets lacked food and receipts of the food purchased that same day. LPA Hamilton conducted a health and safety tele-inspection via Microsoft Teams on 03/18/2021 and observed additional refrigerators and freezers with plenty of food. Furthermore, on 03/18/ County of San Bernardino Open Complaint Investigator (OCI) conducted an unannounced facility inspection and did not observe any shortage of food according to their Investigative Narrative. In regard to the allegation that the facility does not provide a comfortable environment for C1, it was alleged that C1's bedroom had no ventilation and was stuffy due to the sliding glass door being nailed shut. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that all clients were comfortable in the facility and there were no complaints regarding the environment; whereas another confidential interview disclosed that both staff and clients are uncomfortable in the facility due to the heat. In regard to the allegation that the facility windows lack screens, it was alleged that on 03/08/2021 there were no window screens on any of the facility's upstairs windows. Confidential interviews resulted in conflicting information being provided to LPA. Confidential interviews disclosed that the screens staying on the client windows was an issue due to the clients going out on the roof to smoke; whereas other confidential interviews disclosed to LPA that all the facility windows have screens. LPA also observed a picture that was taken of a window at the facility that did not have a screen. LPA Hamilton conducted a health and safety tele-inspection on 03/18/2021 and did not observe any missing window screens. Moreover, on 03/18/ County of San Bernardino Open Complaint Investigator (OCI) conducted an unannounced facility inspection and observed screens on all bedroom windows and a sliding glass door. Based on confidential interviews, observations and document review, the allegations that the facility lacks sufficient food for residents, facility does not provide a comfortable environment for C1 and the facility windows lack screens, may have occurred, however they are not supported or proven by evidence. Therefore, the allegations are unsubstantiated. A copy of this report, LIC 811, and appeal rights were provided to facility manager.",

Other confidential interviews reported S2 does not usually use inappropriate language around clients. LPAs didn't receive additional information. In regard to the allegation that staff (S2) threatens youth in care (C3); it was reported that S2 threatens C3, when C3 refused to accept their medication during the facility's medication distribution time. It was further reported that S2 threatened to \"write up\" C3 and inform their county worker. Confidential interviews reported that S2 took a forceful tone when talking to C3 about accepting their medication after C3 initially refused. Other confidential interviews reported that S2 did not threaten C3 about their refusal of medication. Other confidential interviews reported that S2 was trying to encourage C3 to take their medication. Other confidential interviews reported that C3 and S2 had a positive relationship.

Another confidential interview could not remember missing any scheduled visits. LPAs received inconsistent information. In regard to the allegation that staff (S1-S5) did not provide timely medical care in a timely manner; it was reported that on 6/10/2024, C2 had an \"ear pain\" and that C2 told staff about their ear pain. It was further reported that facility staff did not take C2 for medical treatment until 6/11/2024. Confidential interviews reported that facility staff did not take C2 for medical treatment right away because the facility was short staffed. Other confidential interviews reported that C2's personality of being quiet and non-needy caused C2 to be late, in terms of communicating their ear pain immediately. Confidential interviews reported that as soon as C2 told staff about an ear pain, that S3 then took C2 for medical attention. Confidential interviews reported that the hospital provided medical discharge instructions for C2. Other confidential interviews confirmed that due to C2's quiet personality, they might not communicate any health issues about themselves right away.

X2 required law enforcement intervention resulting in an arrest. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, GOY initiated a health and safety plan to honor the Center for Disease Control and California state government mandates. The order to refrain from utilizing or engage in physical intervention as outlined in the Pro-Act training became effective for staff on March 13, 2020. However, alternative safety measures were unsuccessful in maintaining the health and safety of clients in care as it relates to the aforementioned allegation.

Interviews conducted revealed C1 denied distributing meth to any of the clients at the facility. C1 acknowledged using meth prior to being placed at the facility. However, C1 denied possessing meth during the time C1 was placed at the facility except for one occasion at a party C1 attended during a time C1 was AWOLed (absent without permission). Other clients denied using any illegal drugs at the facility or having any knowledge of any of the clients possessing or using illegal drugs. However, C2 admitted to using meth at the facility that was given to C2 by C1. Interviews revealed both C1 and C2 used meth in their room they shared at the facility. Interviews further revealed that meth was difficult to detect by the facility staff because there is no distinct odor. It was revealed that it is difficult for staff members to always detect drugs used at the facility in general due to their facility policy of not being able to search the client's personal belongings or their person for contraband. It was revealed while staff members do what they can according to facility policy, staff are not always able to recover contraband from the clients because the clients must consent to the searches. Clients admitted they do not always consent to the searches. Interviews further revealed staff members perform routine unannounced room checks at the facility. However, the clients acknowledged that the staff are not always able to find contraband because the clients hide it very well. A review of incident report dated 03/28/2021 reveals reported substance abuse, harm to self and hospitalization concerning C2 occurring during a home pass as C2 admitted to having plans with C1 to obtain meth with the intent to smoke enough to overdose. C2 was taken to the hospital for evaluation and released to a higher level of care. On 04/06/2021, a 14-day notice of removal was issued for C1. During the investigation there was no active criminal case by the local Police Department regarding the alleged distribution of meth at the facility. Information obtained revealed former resident C1 was cited for possession of meth following C1's placement at the facility. Based on information obtained during the investigation, the finding for neglect/lack of supervision is deemed Unsubstantiated meaning, although the allegations may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove a violation occurred. There were no deficiencies cited at this time. Exit interview conducted. Copy of this Report sent via email to Dr. Sultanian, Head of Service.",

During this inspection, 5 out of Direct Care Staff and 3 out of 3 youth files were reviewed. In the inspection, 3 out of Direct Care Staff and 2 out of 3 youth were interviewed (See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated August 8, 2025). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Minutes from the board of directors' meetings related to the facility's incidents involving contact with law enforcement were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the youth case plans, Crisis Safety Plan, Child and Family Team summary, Needs and Service Plan (LIC625), the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Rosas observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance with their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Melissa Kagan, Head of Service.",

LPA and LPM met with Facility Representative. During recent CCLD IB Investigation the following deficiencies were observed: On June 13, 2025, during an unannounced visit at Guiding Our Youth, CCLD Investigators saw that there was only one staff member present for four clients/youth, falling short of the 1:3 staff to client ratio. At 11:55 am, Investigators observed three out of four clients leave the facility without permission (AWOL), but because there was only one staff member present, the staff member did not follow the clients, as staff informed Investigators the AWOL protocol is to follow clients to encourage them to return. Approximately ten minutes later, a second staff member arrived for the start of their shift, and this was followed soon after by facility administrator's arrival. Confidential interviews revealed that staff members do not always follow clients even when the facility is at the correct staffing ratio. Also, during the investigation, record reviews determined that criminal record clearance for Staff member (S1), is not associated with facility personnel roster; however, S1 is actively working at the facility site. The following deficiencies are cited per the Interim Licensing Standards (ILS) 87065.

LPA Segura sent the Administrator Noelle Kinder a Document Request checklist on 10/26/2020. LPA Segura received requested documents on 10/30/2020. On 11/20/ LPA Segura and Jess Macintire counted pills that should be left by reviewing the centrally stored log and medication administration log submitted. At approximately 11:30am LPA and Jess Macintire found that the Centrally Stored log for C1's medication could not account for the amount of pills for Medication 1 (M1, See confidential name list dated 11/24/2020). The Centrally stored log indicated that M1 is a 30 pill bottle started on the 14th of November which should result with 24 pills being present in the bottle. The actual count was 26 pills, it is an extra two pills, which could not be accounted for by reviewing the PMAR for missed meds or refusals. The count for Medication 2 was correct, no irregularity was found. On 11/ LPA Segura called the administrator to revisit the medication count and found that C1 had refused medication on 11/17; which means there is one extra pill. On 11/20/ A count was conducted for C2 as well at around 12:00pm. The count for Medication 2 was found to be correct. However, the count for Medication 1 for C2 did not add up initially and suspected missing medication. On 11/24 at around 11:50am LPA Segura spoke with Continued on 809C Administrator Noelle Kinder and LPA Segura recounted pills and the centrally stored medication record was reviewed. LPA Segura and Administrator Kinder detected the error made in counting the medication on 11/20 was that it was erroneously believed to be a 30 pill bottle; however, it was actually a 14 pill bottle. Count made today 11/24 resulted in a correct pill count. Per Title Regulations, deficiencies were cited during this inspection. Exit interview conducted, appeal rights discussed and a copy of the report was emailed to the facility with a read receipt requested to acknowledge the report was received.",

The Department has determined the allegation that staff #6 yelled at youth is substantiated.

Supervisor stated she supervising the clients and also encouraged one of the client to not engage in the inappropriate behavior. Supervisor also stated that once client came inside, he did not exit out of the facility. At a later time, LPA Harris was able to review video surveillance footage of the incident which she had interviewed Supervisor about. LPA Harris observed that Supervisor came to the back sliding door, after the client came inside and grabbed a piece of fruit off the table, which he threw in the neighbor's yard. The client was able to come back inside, grab another piece of fruit and throw it before Supervisor was in the vicinity and provided directives. The information that Supervisor provided was not accurate according to the footage. LPA Harris discussed the information with Director, Daniel Park and advised that the false statement provided violated the Interim Licensing Standards. The facility will be cited on False Claims, section 80012(a). An exit interview was completed, and appeal rights discussed.

Supervisor stated Client #5 threw the apple, but stated it was an accident. Supervisor stated she thought the apple only hit the fence. Confidential interviews stated Client #5 did throw the apple, but it was an accident. Information obtained stated it was also believed that the apple hit the fence. It was advised that a staff member was inside the facility in the kitchen area. Confidential interviews had conflicting stories regarding the supervision. The facility is approved to have surveillance cameras. LPA Harris requested and reviewed the surveillance camera footage with Administrator, Daniel Park. LPA Harris observed Client #2 and Client #5 outside in the backyard, by themselves. Client #5 had an object in his hand and was making a throwing motion. Client #5 entered the facility and came back outside and made another throwing motion. The footage on the inside of the facility showed no staff member at the door as advised. The Supervisor enters the frame after the two clients returned into the facility. Based on interviews and surveillance footage, there is a preponderance of evidence to prove facility staff are not adequately supervising youth. Therefore, the above allegation is substantiated at this time. This poses a health, safety, and/or personal rights risk to the foster children in care. The facility will be cited on Personnel Duties, section 87065.2 (b)(1). Exit interview conducted and a copy of the report and appeal rights will be provided and the signature will be retained in facility file.",

Based on interviews, there were no statements to determine that staff failed to adequately supervise group home children. Interviews with staff revealed staff denied allegation. Staff indicated that Child #1 and Child #2 were on an outing with staff present and during the outing, Child #2 made an inappropriate comment to Child #1. Staff stated to not have heard the comment made despite being present. Interview with Child #1 and Child #2 indicated staff was present when comment was made and that comment was said just amongst both clients. Once staff became aware of comment made to Child #1, staff took appropriate action by speaking with both clients and increasing supervision.

    "narrative": "On May 3, 2021, Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Regina Martin conducted a Case - Management Incident inspection via Microsoft Teams Meeting to deliver and discuss findings from the Department's Investigation on self-reported incident SIR #710958, dated August 8, 2020. LPA met with Daisy Delgado, Director of Residential Programs. On August 9, 2020, Community Care Licensing received an incident report reporting assaultive behavior by Staff #1 (S1) on Client #1 (C1). It was reported in part, that S1 and C1 were involved in a physical altercation resulting in injury to C1. The incident was referred and assigned to Investigations Branch, Investigator, Dennis Seng. The investigation including confidential interviews, review of related records and review of facility video surveillance footage revealed evidence to support physical abuse by S1 on C1. On August 8, 2020, during an altercation outside of the facility Cottage, C1 became upset that S1 confiscated a portable speaker from C1 for refusing to lower the volume after being asked by S1 to lower it several times. C1 attempted to retrieve the speaker from S1; however, S1 refused to return the speaker to C1. C1 \"flicked,\" S1's hat and pushed him. S1 pushed C1 back and a physical altercation ensued between them. Staff #2 (S2) intervened and separated both parties. C1 was led to Program Support (PSS). After sitting at PSS for several minutes, C1 ran back to the Cottage and pushed S1 again. S1 pushed C1 back and another physical altercation ensued between parties. S2 ran back to the Cottage and separated both parties. Both altercations were captured on surveillance footage. (Continued on page LIC809-C) C1 was checked by the facility nurse and later taken to the hospital for further assessment. Medical records revealed C1 was hit with fists several times and placed in a chokehold, sustaining mild swelling and a brief loss of consciousness. After the altercation S1 left the facility and never returned. On August 9, 2020, S1 called the facility to officially resign from his position. Upon occurrence, the facility contacted all required parties and conducted an internal investigation pertaining to the incident. Corrections concerning facility policy and procedures pertaining to this incident were reviewed and updated as necessary. Based on gathered information there is corroborating evidence to support claims of abuse. The preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has therefore determined substantiated findings for physical abuse by S1 on C1 as evidence revealed S1 failed to de-escalate the situation or call for assistance in controlling C1's behavior. S1's actions on C1 poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. The facility is issued a citation in accordance with the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1; 87072 (d)(11) Personal Rights.

    "narrative": "Information revealed C2 was the victim of sexual assault from C1. C2 was reportedly scared of C1 and C1 forced C2 to engage in sexual acts. According to statements from an eyewitness having firsthand accounts of the incident occurring on December 10, 2020, it was observed C2 was not performing sexual acts, but was receiving sexual acts from C1. While statements provided contradicting information, the incident may have been a consensual encounter. The incident occurred during the overnight shift. The incident was reported to staff who contacted C2 privately and C2 confirmed that he performed oral sex on C1. C1 was moved to a single room after the incident. All appropriate reporting and contacts were completed concerning the incident. According to statements, C2 complied with C1 due to being threatened by C1 and feeling scared. Statements obtained revealed contradicting information concerning a pre-established rule that requires residents who share a room with their roommates to keep their doors open when both residents are occupying the room. In addition, statements revealed that not all staffs properly conduct 15-minute room checks of the residents as facility policy require staff to conduct. Based on information gathered, the preponderance of evidence standard has been met and the Department has determined facility neglected to adequately monitor residents resulting in inappropriate sexual contact by C1 and C2; thus, posing potential risk to the children placed in care. Therefore, facility is cited under the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. See page 9099D for deficiency.

(See the Confidential Names List, LIC 811, dated March 14, 2024). The Plan of Operation including policies and procedures were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the confidential interviews and youth file review including the needs and service assessments, youth case plans, quarterly assessments, and crisis intervention plans, the licensee uses trauma-informed and evidence-based de-escalation and intervention techniques when staff is responding to the behavior of a youth residing in the facility. Interviews with youth and staff indicate the licensee prohibits calls or threats to call law enforcement as a form of discipline. LPA Dahl Larios observed documentation of completed training on policies and procedures on when and how to involve law enforcement in response to an incident. Training records show staff have been trained on Emergency Intervention as required. The licensee is contacting law enforcement in accordance to their Emergency Intervention Plan when there is an immediate risk of serious harm to a child or others. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report was discussed and provided to Assistant Vice President Timothy Lin.",

The investigation revealed that a facility client was found unresponsive in his bedroom by a facility staff on May 18, 2020. The facility client died from a drug overdose. Statements obtained from the confidential interviews indicated that the facility client's death could have been prevented as medical attention could have been administered if staff found him in distress when he vomited during his sleep which was a side effect of the drug overdose. Staff #1 and Staff #2 were assigned to the cottage where the facility client resided. Both staff admitted during the investigation that they did not check on the facility clients during their shift. The video footage obtained of the cottage showed Staff #1 asleep during parts of her shift. Staff #2 was seen on the video to have left the cottage from 0349 hours and returned at 0506 hours. The facility staff failed to conduct their duties per facility policy in checking on the clients every 10 minutes during their shift. Staff #1 and Staff #2 falsified the bedroom check logs and indicated they conducted room checks throughout their shift when they admitted that they did not check on the clients. Both staff were terminated by the facility. Based on the information gathered, the preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation was met, therefore the allegation is substantiated per California Code of Regulations Title 22 - refer to LIC9099-D for deficiencies. Per the new Civil Penalty laws, Health and Safety (H&S) Code section 1548(d), an enhanced civil penalty determination is pending due to the substantiated allegations.

Staff workers that were interviewed provided a statement and denied the allegation of neglect/lack of supervision. It was disclosed that the client has a history of running away and staff acted appropriate in attempting to verbally redirect the client not to run away. Staff interviews did not reveal having any knowledge that the client would return with large amounts of money as a result of any illicit activities when the client was AWOL. Staff workers stated that all clients are always being monitored and staff workers are working within staff to client ratio. The county social worker (CSW) for one of the clients (CSW) expressed no concerns with the care and supervision by the facility. In confidential interviews the client that was identified in the report of running away denied the allegation of having a large amount of money connected to any illicit activities. The client confirmed that he sustained an upper leg injury after climbing over the fence as he was returning back to the facility after being awol. The client stated that staff are present at the facility when he runs away. Two other clients admit to saying comments in the form of \"gossiping\" about the client doing illicit activities when going AWOL and returning to the facility with large amounts of money. Statements by other stated that the allegation was reported only as an abundance of caution, based on hearing two clients \"gossiping\". Based on interviews and records reviewed there was no corroborating information to substantiate the allegation. Although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the above allegation did or did not happen.

LPA Rarela discussed the following with the facility representative named above. On May 21, 2020, the Department received a complaint requesting the investigation of a facility client's death and alleging inadequate staff supervision regarding the incident. The investigation was substantiated and revealed that a facility client was found unresponsive in his bedroom by a facility staff on May 18, 2020. The facility client died from a drug overdose. Statements obtained from the confidential interviews indicated that the facility client's death could have been prevented as medical attention could have been administered if staff found him in distress when he vomited during his sleep, which was a side effect of the drug overdose. Staff #1 and Staff #2 were assigned to the cottage where the facility client died. Staff #1 and Staff #2 were aware that the client had a history of drug abuse and was absent from the facility for 24 hours prior to returning to the facility. Both staff admitted during the investigation that they did not check on the facility clients during their shift. The video footage obtained of the cottage showed Staff #1 asleep during parts of her shift. Staff #2 was seen on the video to have left the cottage from 0349 hours and returned at 0506 hours. The facility staff failed to conduct their duties per facility policy in checking on the clients every 10 minutes during their shift. Staff #1 and Staff #2 falsified the bedroom check logs and indicated they conducted room checks throughout their shift when they admitted that they did not check on the clients. Both staff were terminated by the facility effective June 5, 2020. The facility was cited on September 30, 2020 for 80078(a) Responsibility for providing care and supervision.

LPA Yamamoto met with the facility representative named above and discussed the following: On 3/4/21, the Department received a complaint that staff sexually abused client in care and engaged in conduct inimical to clients in care. Confidential statements obtained during the investigation revealed that the sexual abuse occurred multiple times on facility grounds when client and staff went for one on one walks. Staff orally copulated client and staff allowed client to digitally penetrate staff. Records obtained show the dates and times client and staff were together. Based on this evidence, the complaint was substantiated, and the facility was cited on 9/21/21 under Interim Licensing Standards 87072(d)(11) Personal Rights.

Per Health and Safety Code section 1548(2), \"physical abuse\" includes sexual abuse as defined by Penal Code section 11165.1 which includes Section 288a oral copulation. For a violation that the Department determines resulted in the sexual abuse of a person receiving care at a short-term residential therapeutic program, a civil penalty shall be assessed in the amount of $ 5,000.00 for a facility licensed to care for 41 to 100 children.

The facility is a Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) that is licensed to serve seventy-two (72) male clients ages 12-17 years old. LPA met with William Sanchez, Campus Manager (CM), and together they toured the facility inside and outside. The STRTP is located in a residential neighborhood and presently has clients placed in two cottages (Wittryand Burton). As of today's inspection, Wittry has eight clients in placement and Burton has eight clients in placement as well. Overall, there are sixteen clients currently in placement at the facility. LPA observed the kitchen in each cottage to be clean and well stocked with several food items (perishable and nonperishable). Sharp knives and cleaning supplies are kept locked in areas inaccessible to clients. The bathrooms in each cottage were observed to be in good repair and working order. The bedrooms contained twin beds, desks, and closet space. Medications are kept locked in the Health Services office. The facility has designated six vehicles for client and STRTP related purposes. Exit signs were visible in both of the abovementioned cottages. LPA obtained a current copy of the facility's staff roster (LIC500) and client roster. The last fire drill was held on August 26 2021 at 9:30am. The CM stated that there were no guns or weapons on the premises. LPA reviewed four client files and three staff files and found the reviewed files to be in order. There is a properly secured in-ground swimming pool on the premises enclosed with a self-latching gate. There is adequate seating in each cottage's dining area and living room. All exits were free of hazards and all doors opened freely.

LPA met with William Sanchez, Campus Manager (CM), and discussed the incident. The SIR stated that child #1 (see Confidential Names form (LIC 811) dated December 08, 2021) took a lighter from his pocket and proceeded to light the facility's security camera. During the course of the follow up, LPA obtained information that staff was providing care and supervision at the facility. During a routine accountability check, staff observed the security camera on fire that was located in the corner of the upstairs hallway. Staff investigated the matter and it was determined that child #1 had used a lighter to set the facility's security camera on fire. Staff was unsuccessful in their efforts to get child #1 to empty his pockets. Based on information and facts obtained in this matter, the Department has found that the child was in a gang and struggled with his program while in placement at the facility. The child was able to sneak the lighter into the facility unbeknownst to the staff. Information shows that the child is no longer placed at the facility. Therefore, the situation has been stabilized and no citations will be issued on this date. No further follow up is necessary. Exit interview done",

It was alleged that a staff worker engaged inappropriately with a client of being in a relationship. Staff workers assigned to the cottage where the client was identified as being the alleged victim denied the allegation. All staff workers stated that there is no inappropriate activities occurring among staff and clients. In confidential interviews, all clients that were interviewed denied the allegation and stated that all staff workers are respectable and they have never committed any sexual advances towards them. One client admitted to saying things that were not true while at school about being in a relationship with a female staff. The one client stated that \"it's just talk\" and stated he never had any form of sexual contact with that one staff. Individual identified as other is deemed to be a credible witness who stated that the allegation that was overheard by the one client is accurate when first reported. The County Probation Office representative met with the one client and determined that there were no concerns and no further action was required but will follow up with Licensing Program Analyst Vargas's investigation. Interviews by the clients provided consistent statements and denied the allegation. However, one client admitted to saying that he was having a relationship with a female staff but he was \"just talking\" to others while attending school off-site. Therefore, the above allegations are determined unsubstantiated at this time. A finding that the complaint is unsubstantiated means that although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the alleged abuse occurred. The resolution to this complaint was discussed with the agency representative and copies of all licensing reports were provided at the conclusion of the inspection.

    "narrative": "On this date, Licensing Program Analyst's (LPAs) Reyna Martinez and Jessica Rodriguez conducted an unannounced Case Management and spoke with Program Supervisor (PS), Dekeydra Mothershed. The purpose of Case Management was to discuss an incident that occurred on 10/12/22. Information obtained in an Incident Report (IR) reflects that Client 1(C1) became upset during a Children and Family Team (CFT) meeting, left the meeting then locked himself in his room. When C1 exited his room he advised staff he had ingested \"6 pink pills.\" C1 was then transported by EMS to the hospital for evaluation. LPA's asked PS if she knew how or when C1 obtained the pills. PS stated she was not sure if C1 had \"cheeked\" the pills or if had obtained them during another medication incident. PS stated there was another incident on 10/11/22 where she was in the office destroying some of C1's pills, and he barged into the office and grabbed a medication pack. PS stated staff was able to get the medication back from C1; however, some of the medications fell and staff retrieved them. PS stated that a medication count was conducted and showed all pills were accounted for. LPA's asked if C1 had any history with medication refusal or \"cheeking\" his medications and PS stated he did not. LPA's asked what the typical procedure is when clients take medications she stated clients take the medication place it on their tongue, drink water, then open their mouth and show staff heir tongue and underneath their tongue. PS stated since the incident staff are making sure to do an extra check with C1 to ensure that he is not \"cheeking\" his medications. PS stated that Mental Health Services for C1 have also been increased and staff are attempting to provide more one on one services and \"check ins\" with him. PS stated, currently C1 is on independent studies in an attempt to try and get him more stabilized. LPAs spoke with C1 regarding the incident. C1 stated to LPAs that he was feeling upset and suicidal because he is unhappy at school and does not like being around kids. LPAs asked C1 where he got the pills from. C1 said that he was \"cheeking\" his pills to keep them. LPAs asked C1 if staff would check his mouth after giving him his medications. C1 said that yes they would but he still could hide the pills from staff. LPAs asked C1 if he feels supported from staff and mental health services. C1 said yes he does feel staff is supportive and his mental health services are helping him. C1 said that he does not feel supportive from his school and does not want to be around other kids. Additionally, LPA's discussed reporting requirements with PS and esnuring that IR's are as detailed as possible. No deficiency will be issued at this time. An exit interview was conducted, and a copy of the report was provided to the facility.",

Two clients declined to be interviewed. One client stated the accused staff picked him up, threw him on the ground, and pushed him on one occasion in the Behavioral Management Center (BMC). Another client stated that same staff picked him up by the shirt and shoved him against the wall, making the client hit his head on one occasion in the BMC. These clients were credible in their statements. One client was interviewed multiple times about this and remained consistent and credible. All staff denied any physical abuse occurring.

After [Client 1] was released from the restraint, [Client 1's] left wrist was injured so he was immediately transported to the [Hospital]. [Client 1] was diagnosed with a fractured left wrist. During the interview [Client 1] said the restraint did not cause his injury. It is unknown if [Client 1] injured his wrist in the fight or when he hit himself with (a) scooter or the application of the restraint. Staff [1] and [Staff 2] stated they didn't think they caused the injury during the application of the restraint. Other staff stated they didn't believe [Staff 1] injured [Client 1] on purpose, and [Client 1's] injury was an accident.\" Additionally, the re-breaking of Client 1's arm/wrist during a subsequent restraint was investigated and has an inconclusive finding as well due to not knowing what specifically caused that re-break as Client 1 also had been hitting his previously injured hand/wrist on windows aggressively immediately before the restraint.

Linda Abdelbaki, Program Planner with CPS, was also present during the meeting. Issues discussed today: 1. Lack of supervision. 2. Administrative oversight. 3. Incident Reporting. 4. Emergency Interventions. 5. False reporting. 6. Personal rights. Discussion: 1: Lack of Supervision - Director explained that they had meetings with staff to explain how getting coverage works, and that they wrote up a system for how staff can get support. Explained who all is on campus who can be contacted for extra support. Explained how they handle staff in crisis situation. Subsequent trainings conducted. How they hold staff accountable. They do not use administrative staff as part of the ratio, however Administration assists in situations. 2: Administrator Oversight: It was discussed that the Administrator needs to be present at the facility for a minimum of 20 hours per week. Director and CEO informed CCL staff present that there are actually multiple Administrator-qualified members of the staff who are present in the facility to meet this requirement. It is understood that the Administrator(s) shall provide oversight of the staff. 3. Incident Reporting: There was an incident regarding bed bugs at the facility for which an incident report was sent to CCL on 5/24/2021, and the facility did not update/report new developments. Director explained all steps they have taken to get rid of the bed bugs since then. The facility did not notify CCL about them moving the clients to the gym while the facility was being treated. It was explained to Director/CEO/President that they must notify CCL about moving clients. LPM asked Director how they are training their staff to write incident reports. Director explained. LPM asked Director about what they ask staff to remove from incident reports, and Director explained. 4. Emergency Interventions: The facility uses the ProAct emergency intervention program which includes non-physical and physical interventions. The facility trains staff in trauma-informed care. 5. False Reporting: CCL and Administration discussed the substantiated finding of false claims from the complaint delivered on 12/18/2020. This complaint was re-opened on 5/6/2021 to obtain more information. CCL explained to Administration that concluding the further investigation, the finding that staff falsified a document, stands. Administration will take further action with the staff who falsified a document, and send the plan and documentation to CCL. 6. Personal Rights: RM discussed the case management finding delivered on 12/18/2020 regarding a staff member violating two clients personal rights by picking them up and pushing them. RM informed Administrative staff that CCL is taking an Administrative Action against that staff to be excluded. LPA Chad Cabigon and Director will develop a plan to check in with each other weekly.

    "narrative": "The client needed a refill, however the medication prescribed required a prior authorization from Medi-Cal. The facility worked with the pharmacy to get the prior authorization ahead of time, however, it did not come in time. The facility proactively requested an emergency supply of the medication. The emergency supply ran out, one dose, before the prior authorization was approved and the full prescription could be filled. The misunderstanding in the MAR occurred because staff were giving the emergency supply to the client, however it was miscommunicated and not documented properly, so other staff thought the client missed the medication. LPA found that the pharmacy and Medi-Cal issues caused the missed dose of medication, and not the facility. Since then, the facility did conduct a refresher training with staff to prevent any future confusion. LPA also found that two staff did mismanage two different clients' medications. 1. On 4/25/2021, one staff gave a client another client's medication. The client was monitored and had no issues. The staff was written up and provided a refresher training. 2. On 5/14/2021, another staff gave a different client another client's medication. The client was monitored and had no issues. The staff was written up and provided a refresher training. LPA obtained those write-ups and proof of training. Due to staff mismanaging clients' medications, LPA finds the allegation that staff are mismanaging minors medication to be substantiated, or true. On this date the facility is being cited for a violation of the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 6, section 80078(a).

During interviews, LPA learned that the cycling of gnats lasted for about four weeks. On 2/16/2021 when LPA visited the facility and observed the dead gnats in the pantry, it was about the time that the gnat issue was resolving. After that inspection, the facility had maintenance staff clean out the overhead light where the dead gnats were, and other staff cleaned up the rest. Soon after, the facility put a mat over the closed crawlspace to try to further prevent anymore gnats from coming through. This completely resolved the issue. In subsequent visits (in person, and virtually) to the facility, LPA did not observe any more gnats in the pantry. Based on all the interviews and evidence, LPA found that the facility did have insects, so the finding for this allegation is substantiated, or true, however LPA also found the facility did take the correct actions necessary to rid the facility of the pests.

Staff also reported that sometimes staff are not able to shadow clients who AWOL due to staff being stretched thinly in a crisis. It was disclosed by staff that four clients were left alone due to staff having to follow a high-risk client who AWOL'd and on another occasion staff left two clients alone with an intern, who is not counted in ratio and is not considered staff. Another staff stated that they had to leave three clients alone in a cottage before due to having to handle another situation, while radioed help needed to come assist. A client also confirmed that; frequently, up to two to three times a day, staff will have to radio for assistance when handling an emergent situation and the clients would be alone for five to ten minutes until someone else can come to assist. LPA observed a common scenario of staff being stretched thinly to where they cannot handle the supervision needs of clients when multiple clients are in crisis, or restraints, or AWOL. Although the facility meets the general minimum ratio required in the Interim Licensing Standards, they are not providing adequate staffing ratios for the clients' needs and behaviors. Based on interviews, LPA has found the allegation that the facility does not provide adequate supervision of clients to be substantiated, or true. The facility is being cited for violations of the Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards Version 3. Section 87095 (b) Emergency Interventions. The facility was also cited for Section 87065.5(g). An office meeting was held on 6/14/2021 with the Department's Regional Manager, Licensing Program Manager, Licensing Program Analyst and facility representatives to further discuss these serious violations. A copy of this report was sent to the Administrator, Annette Jumper, by email with a read receipt which will serve as her signature.",

While in possession of the glass, the youth swung at other youth and facility staff and threatened to harm people with it. Law enforcement officers eventually detained the youth who was transported to a hospital for a 5150 evaluation. As a result of this incident, the facility discharged the youth from the program-when the hospital determined that the youth was no longer a danger to others or the youth's self and was therefore ready to be discharged from acute care, the facility did not accept the youth back citing safety concerns, and deferred to the youth's parent for placement elsewhere. In the facility's Discharge Policy, a copy of which was acknowledged and signed by both the youth and the youth's adoptive parent, the facility has a provision that allows an unplanned discharge-a more immediate discharge without the usual 14-day notice-if it is determined that a client is \"a clear danger to self or others.\" In submitted Incident Reports and CFT meeting notes, C1's difficulty in controlling their anger, impulsiveness, as well as a history of physical aggression towards peers and staff were documented along with the facility's efforts in trying to address these behaviors. Documentation also shows that there were times during placement when the youth was doing well as evidenced by a decrease in disruptive and problematic behaviors. A more recent interview with the youth and with staff at the youth's current placement indicated that the youth has not displayed any dangerous behaviors and was generally doing well.

Six out of seven youths interviewed did not confirm experiencing, or having witnessed or heard of, any client being lifted, dragged, or otherwise forcibly taken by staff to the BMC. All nine staff interviewed were consistent in describing the protocol for utilization of the BMC, including which actions by staff are allowed and which are prohibited in trying to get youth to the separation room-particularly, staff were in corroboration that when a client drops their weight staff can only wait for that client to get back up, and that no kind of lifting is ever allowed. Regarding a youth being hit by another peer, three of the seven clients interviewed corroborated this but described it only within the context of peer-to-peer fighting involving the client in question, with one of the other clients characterizing the said youth as the actual aggressor.

Interviews revealed that the foster child that was previously placed at the facilty climbed through the window which was opened by a new client who had no clue both foster children had issues with each other. Interviews with staff revealed that foster child voluntary had provided the other foster child with the PIN # to her cell phone which gave her access to everything on her phone. Interviews with County Social Worker indicated that both foster children got along well but had a recent fall out because one foster child began dating the other foster child's boyfriend which created conflict between them. The staff reported that the house rules is something that's discussed constantly with clients to prevent incidents such as the misuse of cellphones. Other statements obtained during the investigation were unable to corroborate the allegation. LPA attempted to interview both foster children but was unsuccessful due to both foster children being AWOL from their placements. CSW indicated that they cannot be located.

    "narrative": "On 10/25/23 the Department received a complaint alleging the facility did not prevent client from chronically running away from care. It was alleged that client was physically assaulted and sexually trafficked while on AWOL from the facility. Based on the information gathered during confidential interviews, relevant parties denied the allegation indicating client ran away from the facility six times during client's stay at the facility from 5/24/23 through 6/13/23. Confidential interviews indicated when clients AWOL from the facility staff will be attempted to redirect clients, offer alternatives, and follow clients as the clients are AWOLing. Staff will then report AWOL, and call law enforcement. Once a client returns staff will offer medical attention and a safety check is conducted. Confidential interviews revealed clients have no concerns with the facility and stated staff will attempt to redirect clients and offer alternatives. LPA was not able to obtain a statement from the alleged victim due to the victim being on run away status. CSW indicated having no concerns with the facility and stated the incident happened when client was on AWOL and no longer placed at the facility. CSW indicated the client has been on AWOL status for a year. The other agency's delivered service logs and investigative report did not mention client being AWOL'd from the facility, however, there continues to be safety risks for client. LPA reviewed incident reports which indicated client AWOL'd from the facility six times. Each time client AWOL'd, staff wrote incident reports and intervention was attempted. LPA reviewed the STRTP's run away plan and client's safety plan which indicated the steps the facility took to try and discourage client from AWOLing. Based on the interviews and records reviewed the allegation is/are found unsubstantiated. Although the allegation may have happened or are valid, there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove the allegation. Appeals rights were provided and discussed with the facility representative mentioned above. There were no deficiencies cited.",

Staff stated children are not restricted from receiving essential items or necessities as forms of punishments. Children stated they have never seen or experienced staff restricting them or doing inappropriate forms of disciplines. Furthermore, it was alleged staff do not accord privacy to minors in care.

Children stated that they are not aware or ever had any staff not afford them privacy in the home. It was alleged facility is in disrepair.

Per Christine Gonzalez and Andrew Hernandez, Client #2 is a student of Hillsides school but not a client of ther STRTP.

    "narrative": "During the investigation, interviews were conducted with, but not limited to, C1, S1, residents, and staff members. A review of facility records including past incident reports and client file history revealed insufficient evidence to support alleged claims. Review of an incident report involving S1 and C1 dated 12/17/2017, revealed in part that C1 was \"bullying another client\" while S1 was attempting to de-escalate the situation. C1 became upset and attempted to attack S1 as S1 attempted to restrain C1. At some point a physical altercation ensued between C1 and S1 resulting in both parties wrestling on the floor. Other staff were present and assisted S1 with restraining C1. S1 states that any physical contact made with C1 was non-sexual and only with the intent of restraining C1. There was no corroborating evidence to support claim. The investigation revealed that while physical contact was made during an apparent restraint between C1 and S1 on 12/17/2017, to which other staff were present and assisted, there is not enough evidence to support the allegation that S1 touched C1 inappropriately in private areas during the restraint and/or while in care. The finding has therefore been determined as Unsubstantiated meaning, although the allegation may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove or disprove a violation occurred. There are no deficiencies cited at this time. Exit interview conducted and a copy of this report and appeal rights are emailed to Facility Administrator. C1's room and on another instance where C1 was showering. S1 reports that the instances were inadvertent, and no knocks were made prior to entering C1's door. S1 reports being in a rush at the time and accidentally walked in on C1 during both incidents. S1 denies any sexual gratification derived from these incidents and states they were accidents. S1 states that S1 left immediately after both incidents. Based on the confidential interviews conducted and documentary evidence obtained during the investigation the preponderance of evidence standard has been met that a violation occurred, therefore the above allegation is determined Substantiated. Facility is cited per the Interim Licensing Standards for STRTP V 3.1; Section 87065. Personnel Duties. S1 accidentally walked in C1's room on two separate occasions while C1 was undressing and while C1 was showering. Actions as such pose potential health and safety risks to children in care. Exit.

Statements further revealed the sexual assault incident was not disclose to any of the Hillside staff or C1's former assigned Social Worker. Confidential statements and record review revealed Hillside staff frequently checked on clients (every 15-30 minutes) during sleep hours, children ages 11 and under resided in a separate cottage from the older age group (12 and up); there was close supervision in each cottage, and statements obtained did not reveal any issues regarding care and supervision.

Per the allegation, C1 admitted to this behavior. Also alleged in the report is that C1 was doing sexual things to C2 before C1 was moved rooms, as they were roommates. It was also detailed in the allegation that once C2 disclosed this information to GH staff, C2 changed rooms. Confidential witness statements corroborate that C1 did these actions to C2, however, confidential interviews also corroborate that C2 dared C1 to do some of these actions to C2. One witness maintains not all of these actions were solicited. While C1's needs and service plan does mention C1's sexual history, there is nothing in the needs and service plan requiring for C1 to be under constant supervision. Finally, all witnesses corroborate that staff members were sitting at a picnic table not far from the lake where C1 and C2 were swimming when these incidents occurred. Staff were within eyesight of C1 and C2 and never observed any of these interactions occur between C1 and C2. All witnesses also corroborate C2 did not tell staff this was happening and remained with C1 during the length of the outing. Based on interviews conducted, the allegation that a lack of supervision resulted in inappropriate sexual interaction between C1 and C2 while in care may have occurred, however, it is not supported or proven by evidence. The allegation is, therefore, UNSUBSTANTIATED. There are no deficiencies to be cited.

Most witnesses corroborate that C1 was not bullied or verbally harassed during C1's time at the STRTP. Several confidential statements corroborate that C1 makes up lies about the STRTP and other clients in the home. Additionally, these confidential statements all corroborate that C1 is an attention seeker and is often the instigator of any verbal altercations that occurred between clients in the home, causing staff to have to redirect both C1 and other involved parties. All witnesses deny ever bullying or witnessing C1 be bullied at the STRTP during C1's time at the STRTP. Confidential witnesses also deny verbally harassing C1. Staff deny C1 ever reporting to staff that C1 was being bullied or verbally harassed while at the STRTP. While staff confirm several incidents of verbal arguments have occurred between C1 and other clients in the home, most witnesses deny this being labeled as bulling or verbal harassment, but instead, verbal disagreements and client squabbles. Staff confirm C1 did report to staff that C1 did not feel safe at the facility to staff, that is why C1 was relocated.

Details state C1 sustained a \"fat lip\" during the attack and then C1 was placed on a 5150 hold. S1 denies charging and attacking C1 and denies injuring C1 and giving C1 a \"fat lip\". S1 states C1 was threatening to hurt and kill S1 and also threatening to self-harm which is why S1 took away the pencil from C1. S1 states S1 raised S1's arms to block the attack from C1, however, denies hitting, assaulting, or attacking C1 in any form. Additionally, S1 states she did not give C1 a \"fat lip\" either. Another witness maintains staff put hands on C1, however, witness was unsure of how S1 physically attacked or grabbed C1 as could not provide any details. All witnesses corroborate that there was a verbal altercation between C1 and S1, however, S1 states she had to raise her voice to try to de-escalate C1 as C1 was extremely escalated and yelling loudly. There were no witnesses that observed any physical interaction between S1 and C1. One witness states they heard C1 yell things such as, \"Get off me! Get your hands off me!\" but did not see what was happening as the room door was closed and the incident occurred in the hallway area of the house. The majority of witnesses state S1 has never put hands on any clients in the STRTP.

Four of the seven interviewed stated that staff reported elopements to CCL, the clients' county social workers, and law enforcement. Based on interviews and record review, C1 had received a CSEC advocate, but counseling was unsuccessful in redirecting. According to one interview, the facility had been working with the Rialto Police Department to catch the adult men that C1 had engaged with. Based on one confidential interview, the facility did not report elopements with adult men to law enforcement. LPA Hood conducted an interview with C1's current case worker (CW). CW shared that they were not the case worker at the time of the allegations, the case worker at the time of the allegations was no longer with the county. LPA Hood reviewed the CPS Screener Narratives, two were submitted for this incident with C1. On 5/13/2022, the CPS narrative states that the facility had not yet submitted a referral, but they had alerted the county case worker. Another referral was opened on 5/19/2023 due to other concerns with C1 engaging in CSEC activity. The CPS investigations are not complete, LPA Hood made unsuccessful attempts to contact the investigating case worker. LPA Hood reviewed twelve incident reports between 5/10/2022 and 2/1/2023. Based on a review of the incident reports, the facility did report elopements to CCL, law enforcement, and the social worker. Based on confidential interviews and record review, the allegation that client engaged in CSEC activity due to a lack of supervision may or may not be true; however, the allegation has not met the preponderance of doubt. Therefore, the above allegation is unsubstantiated at this time. No deficiencies were cited during this visit.

    "narrative": "Confidential interviews were inconsistent regarding who was involved and witnessed the incident, except S6. Confidential interviews reported that, based on C1's past behaviors, staff reasonably suspected that C1 was hiding contraband in their pants pocket. Multiple confidential interviews reported that staff repeatedly asked C1 to let go of the pants and staff tried to de-escalate the situation; C1 would not loosen their grip on the pants and refused to comply with staff. Confidential interviews reported staff (S6) was not aggressive toward C1 but did reach for the pants, resulting in C1 pulling the pants, which caused C1 and S6 to fall to the floor. A confidential witness interview reported that S6 restrained C1 while C1 was on the ground. Other confidential interviews reported that C1 and S6 did not fall to the ground, and S6 did not restrain C1. In addition, confidential interviews reported that S6 did not hit C1, and C1 did not sustain any injuries or require medical attention. Pertinent documentation also reported that C1 had no observable marks or bruising. Other confidential interviews reported that S6 choked C1 and disclosed that C1 reported being physically abused by staff at the STRTP. The LPA did not receive any corroborating information during confidential interviews as the interviews denied staff hit or mistreated clients in care. The Department also received an allegation that staff spoke inappropriately to the minor (C1) in care. It was alleged that staff called C1 names. Confidential interviews reported staff did not yell or speak negatively about C1 or other clients in care. Other confidential interviews reported staff (S1) called names and made derogatory remarks about client behaviors. It was further reported that there were no concerns regarding client and staff interactions; confidential interviews reported staff were respectful and acted professionally. Based on inconsistent confidential interviews and pertinent documentation, the allegations that staff (S6) hit a minor (C1) in care and staff spoke inappropriately to the minor (C1) in care are unsubstantiated. The allegations may have happened or are valid, but there is not a preponderance of evidence to prove that the alleged violations occurred. An exit interview was conducted.

In addition, information obtained from other confidential interviews reported that clients do not have access to sharp objects.

CCL: Licensing Program Analyst (LPA) Enrique Hernandez, Licensing Program Manager (LPM) Rosa Rodriguez and Regional Manager (RM) Kellee Coleman.

Fresno County: Melissa Chacon, Yesenia Delgado: Social Worker, Joelle Homes Sacramento County: Katelyn Foley, Veronica Carrillo, Tashna Ward, Careylee Oden, Genevieve Maze, Ozavar Saadet. The non-compliance conference call with Hope Refuge Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP) and Counties was conducted to discuss the following concerns: 1. Personnel Issues, 2. Medication, 3. Outbreak with the scabies, 4. Construction, 5. Facility Physical plant, 6. Complaints, 7. Special Incident Reports Page 1 of Personnel Issues: Kellee: My understanding is that Hope Refuge had an administrator Jerome Smith who oversaw the facility operations, and that he was recently let go. Can Sally explain why was Jerome let go? and Why did Gloria the head of service quit, and then come back when she learned that Jerome was let go? Regional Manager stated there should off been more supervision on the CEO's part, to make sure Jerome was doing his job efficiently and complied with the regulations. CEO was instructed to review the Interim Licensing Standard to be able to understand the Regulations, and if she had any questions after reviewing them to reach out to the Department for assistance. Sally: Stated that she hired Jerome Smith as the managing director of the program in February to help them open the facility, but they found out that he was lacking performances. Special Incident Reports (SIR) were not being sent to Community Care Licensing (CCL) timely. She stated that they have only been opened for three months, and the facility was cited for deficiencies observed during the last inspection visit in June, but all those deficiencies have been corrected. They hired David Harper to assist them with personnel issues, like hiring new Administrator, Head of Service, and train new staff. In the beginning she was not aware that it was necessary to report administrator changes to CCL, and it was a learning curve for them. Regarding the Head of Service, they now have Gloria Gonzalez. She agreed that her husband and her are responsible for the oversight of the facility, but it has only been three months and now they are putting checks and balances into place. Sometimes, issues did not seem to come up immediately in the initial opening, but there were many new things for them to learn. Now they act immediately when they started seeing issues. She stated they are working with David and Gloria to make sure things are highlighted and taken care right away. Kellee: When you state checks and balances, would you have documentation, evaluation, how do we understand or know that these checks and balances would follow? I want to see some of the training you are providing with the topic, sign-in sheets and an overview of what you provide to staff. All staff including the CEO should be aware of the interim licensing standard. Some of the key areas that keep the physical plan clean, reporting requirements of what to report, mandatory reporters that if they see something inappropriate boundaries with youth, they are responsible for reporting to the CCL, Child Abuse Hotline. We will give you a time frame to submit the checks and balances, but we have a short window for this to happen. The Provisional License was obtained on November 8, 2019 and the first placement occurred a few months ago but, we look at when the license was issued not when the first child was place at the facility or when the facility started operating. We cannot allow this issues and concerns to continue and issue a permanent license. We have September and October to make a clear decision on how we are going to move forward with the license. Page 2 of David Harper: Jerome didn't put any system in place, he was trying to do everything himself. I can send you the training's that I have already done with the staff. I am trying to train staff on SIR's. I hope to get more administrator open positions, but they need to understand the licensing regulations and guidelines. This is going to take some time it is going to take weeks or maybe months until the system is up and running. There are things that take priority and one of them was medication. Medication training was the first week I was here, then the second week we did Crisis Management, Environmental Control, The Crisis Psychopath and this week we did medication training again. As an administrator, I have been doing this for 30 years. I have been calling Enrique and Rosa and if I had this agenda 3 weeks ago, I might of have some of the things together for you. I understand that there were things that were cited during the site visit in June. Kellee: You may have already started to correct some of the things you were cited, and you have to add others, but you can put all that in the plan that you are going to present to CCL. Rosa: David, I would like to thank you for joining in the conference call. Do not be frustrated that you have obtained this information now and not prior to the call but this issues and concerns have been going on for a long time, before you came on board and I want to thank you for assisting the facility to be in compliance. My only concern is that you are going to leave in two months from Hope Refuge, what will happen when you leave and who will be training the staff? David: We have only been operating for three months. When you say this is going on for a long time, three months is a short period during the COVID pandemic around the world. I am planning to be here for a few months. I am working with them right now to find an Administrator. Kellee: I'm glad the head of service is back on board, make sure the kids need are met regarding their mental health services. Sally where are you with your Mental Health Program Approval revisions? Sally: Is with the state right now that was in an email to Enrique. We got our contract with the county back in February. They changed the mental health, the contract with the county comes first. The county has been working hard. Rosa: Sally did you get the medical Certification from the county and the program approval? And have they schedule a site visit? Sally: Yeah, everything that is required by the state. The site visit has not been schedule. Kellee: Gloria Gonzalez have you worked in another STRTP before? If you have any questions on interim licensing standards when it comes to therapeutic portion contact us or CCR Page 3 of Rosa: You need to ensure that the needs and service plan is updated every 30 days Gloria Gonzalez: No. I have been here less than a month, I'm becoming aware of the procedures and guidelines, and my role is to bring critical support for the whole organization. My background is a license psychotherapy, I worked in transitional housing program and working with youth in Ventura county. Yes, regarding the needs and service plan. We are doing our audits to make sure we comply, also with the 30 day and 90-day CFT. I'm making sure all the administrator staff is aware. Kellee: Is there a qualified facility manager on all shifts 24 hours a day? even though they may not have the facility manager title. Rosa: I understand that Dana is the facility manager and she is at the facility Monday through Friday and leaves on Friday nights. So, who supervises the facility on the weekend? David Harper: I am in the process of having people who stay on the mountain and who are qualified for that. I think it's a 1 to 2-hour training. It's important, but it's not my top priority, I'm trying to get everything else in order. We currently have Jamila staying here for the weekend, she is a social worker and Dana and I are on call, then we have Lee who we're going to train, so there is always a lead staff from Sunday to Saturday. And in case of emergency Dana doesn't live too far away, Gloria can also come, and Sally and Chuck are downhill, they can come as well. Kellee: Is the facility providing cellphones, work email address, is the child information stays confidential? I just want to make sure because people are using more phones. We just want to make sure that is clear to all our providers. David Harper: We don't send child's information to anyone's phone. We have work e-mails every employee has a work email. Leadership they all have company cellphone and the staff uses their personal cellphone. if we are communicating about a client is thru our work e-mail. We don't send text messages about a client with our personal phone. Rosa: How many staff are out there during the nighttime? David Harper: We have 11 clients in placement right now. We have the night staff in ratio, and I have questions about the ratio. I have been trying to get a hold of Enrique and Rosa because we want to expand and want to make sure I stay with licensee requires. Right now, we are in 1 to 6 ratios in all our cottages. One cottage has 6 kids and the other cabin has 5 kids, 1 to 6 at night staff and 1 to 4 during the awake hours. If we were a 6 facility it will be 1 to 3 ratios. Rosa: The ration should be indicated in the program statement. You should review the program statement for clarification on what was initially approved. Page 4 of Medication Kellee: Who administers the medication? is there a nurse? and do we have daily logs? We want to have a written plan for your training on the responsibilities of the nurse and how the medication is refilled. There was a situation where a girl reported that she did not receive the medicine on time. Client was treated for scabies. When Sally picked up the medicine, she decided to take it until the next day. We can't let children go without medication especially psychotropic medication. Who is responsible of the JV220? The nurse also needs to verify when the child is first place there that they have all their medication? Sally: I pick it up from the pharmacy during closing hours and drop it off first thing the next morning. I talked about it with Enrique but, it wasn't that I had the medication in hand. It was the closing time of the pharmacy. David Harper: We have a nurse and we are training staff to administer medication and yes, we do have records. When I arrived, the medication was not together. The last administrator was doing his own thing, there are still some errors, but now everything is fixed. Now we are putting things in place to make sure that clients arrive with medications and that everything is correct. Now we are trying to do it consistently. Some counties do not comply with JV220, some counties expect parents to sign a document to get permission for children to take psychotropic medications, and San Bernardino is one of those counties. Kellee: If it meets the county requirements, something must be documented on file and parental permission must be in place. Parents should be aware of the side effects when their children are taking this drug. What our Department look at is the responsibility of the facility. If we conduct a records review during an inspection and we do not see any documentation in the client's file and the facility only has a verbal information, we will take that you did not follow the JV220 procedure authorized by the court. Noe Villa: Part of the JV220 is the Social Worker's responsibilities. I want to encourage the facility to save any emails, voicemail calls from that caseworker who is the key person, who is not doing their job. We are seeing a trend that a lot is in the weight of the social worker. Page 5 of Outbreak with the scabies Kellee: We have the scabies situation. We received a complaint on July 29, 2020 that a girl had bites under her arms. Sally found out on August 1, 2020. Please note that the reporting requirements states you have 24 hours to report the incidents. If it happens after 5pm on a Friday, you have until Monday to report. Enrique is not taking all the incident reports, Enrique may be out of the office, that's why we have a worker on call working on that mailbox Monday through Friday from 8 to 5 p.m. Sally: One of the girls had what looked like bites and the doctor diagnosed that they look like bed bugs. Then there were other clients and staff who were itching, so we sent everyone to get checked out to see the doctor and they were treated. We have the documentation of the pest control and receipts of the treatments for scabies. The nurse is constantly doing body checks on the girls. Pest control comes every two months. The first time they came was on July 30, 2019, it was done internally. I found out about scabies on August 1, Dana Roscoe: On July 29 the client showed me some bites and she was itching. We immediately scheduled a doctor's appointment. The first available appointment was August 3 in the meantime we provided her some anti itching cream. The following day a pest control company came, and on august 1 we took everyone to urgent care. We have in in her file the medication that was provided. The first time that we sent an incident report was on August 3, 2020 that was two days later. Sally Contacted Enrique to let him know what was going on. We always sent the incident reports to CCL and CC Enrique on them. Construction not authorized timely Kellee: Construction going on at the facility without CCL's approval. What are those manufactured/ mobile home? What's the purpose of those and are you getting a permit from the city? I think there was emails back and forth with you and Enrique. I don't know if he approved as an error, we are going to look into that. Where is the electricity and the pluming? I'm looking at the one that is on wheels. Who is leaving in there? How many are you trying to put up? Sally: The purpose of those are housing for staff Chuck: The building that we are building is a mobile home on wheels it has wheels located by the stone house. There's no permit required that I'm aware for RV. Everything that I read it says that there's is no permit required. We are not adding to the site, is a license RV. Page 6 of Rosa: We licensed the entire campus that's one address, everything that happens on the premises, we have to approve it before you do anything. My understanding is that we didn't receive any request to bring those mobile homes on site. Chuck: We reached out to Enrique and walk him through the whole process, that's my understanding. Chuck: The tiny house was already here when the license was issued. There are 2 tiny houses in the field and the mobile home park on wheels. There are 4 hook ups in the field. At the time of licensure, we had three there, now we have two. They are only use for staff to live in there right now. David Harper is living in the tiny house and Pricilla is living in the other one. We are only sticking with two. There are septic lines Kellee: When Enrique was doing the visit there was electrical saw that was left out, what happen? We had this discussion with you before, that all the items need to be put away when there's no supervision. Chuck: Is not an area where the children go. When Enrique came, I was working, then I went to see Enrique and that's the reason. Enrique told me to put everything away before I went to see him. There're no power tools out there anymore. I'm very clear to put everything away now. Kellee: Volunteers on the premises, is in the interim licensing standards that everyone who frequent the facility must be fingerprinted. Construction Companies don't have to be fingerprinted if they are just there to do the construction job for a certain period of time. Make sure you are reading the Provider Information Notices (PIN). If you use the same contractor to do your repairs in your location, you must get that person fingerprinted. If it is a onetime contractor that person doesn't have to be fingerprinted. Chuck: Everyone that comes to work have license #. Sally: We understand that. Physical Plant Kelle: I would like to see a checklist for reporting daily repairs and being reported quickly. Enrique said something that a tour of the facility will be conducted every two weeks but, I would like to see a weekly checklist. We need to see something in writing that you are keeping a record. Was the heater installed? Make sure your chef has a checklist. It shouldn't be expired food in the kitchen and things not properly covered in the refrigerator. You have a big location and you're going to have to make repairs. If your staff see something that needs to be repaired, they need to report it in writing immediately. Like plugs sticking out of the wall, any type of repairs. If you guys don't agree with some of the deficiencies, you can appeal. When there is a repair, for example the bathroom, Enrique should be informed. Keep CCL inform even though there are a lot of bathrooms in the facility to ensure that you meet the requirements. Page 7 of Rosa: I know you call Enrique and call me. I will suggest email or call the OD worker in the future so you can get your questions answered right away. Sometimes Enrique and I are handling other calls or are in meetings and are not able to answer your calls right away. David Harper: I think he pretended to take pictures of the staff. He says he didn't take any pictures, as soon as we found out we self-reported the incident. It was a company phone I personally went through the photos and didn't see any photos of the children or staff. We take pictures of the children for the life book only. Karry: I have a question; Can David elaborate on the allegation of the girl locked in the cabin. Dana Roscoe: No, there was never a time when the girl was locked out of the cabin. Kellee: Any of the other counties have any questions of what we discussed? Kerry: Are the children still receiving expired food? David Harper: The children did not get any expired food, the food they are trying to say was expired was in the staff cabin, and the children never ate, even if the food was expired it was never intended for the children. Kellee: There was a water gun painted black, why would a child have a water pistol in his possession? I don't think a squirt gun is appropriate. I don't know who allowed it. David Harper: They were having a water day; it was hot outside. The water gun was painted black, we shouldn't have painted it black. We spoke to the staff and the client about it and informed them that it is important that we do not take things that look like a weapon. I agree with you that painting the gun black was highly inappropriate. But are you telling me, that from a licensing point of view that there is a regulation that does not allow me to let the child play with a water gun? Kellee: is just traumatized for the youth just the word gun can be traumatic. David Harper: We won't buy water guns. Conference call ended at 12:30 pm and all the parties who participated on the call were thanked for their time and no nobody had additional questions. Page 9 of Sally: Yes, the new AC unit is installed David Harper: Absolutely we will notify you of any repairs. We have a maintenance director who is here during the week, the staff has a system that reports all maintenance issues. Our director of maintenance tours the facility every day and prioritizes which are the most important needs are. I meet with him weekly. We have an online system for staff to report any repairs. You ding us about milk sale by date and not by expiration date. The milk will still be good for the next 7 days. We follow FDA regulations. We are making sure to move the food; new things go in the back and old things in the front. Kellee: If you going to do a plan of correction from this meeting, write what are you doing right now and identify the system in place. Complaints Kellee: The complaints are on the following allegations: scabies, the child does not receive medical attention, but you addressed that and gave her an anti-itch cream. You need to send Enrique proof of what you did. We also have a complaint that Jerome canceled her laundry day and her clothes were taken out when there were wet. If that happened, it is unacceptable. In addition, the girl was locked in her cabin and had gone out the window. The staff did not stop the children from smoking marijuana. Staff used inappropriate forms of punishment. The staff did not prevent minors from being vandalized. The staff did not ensure that the minors were cared for by a therapist. Enrique is investigating these complaints. Dan Roscoe: This young lady is aware, and she knows that laundry time is after school and her issue was that she wanted the laundry to be done that morning. Jerome instructed her that those are the rules in place to have her laundry completed after school. Her clothes could be dried David Harper: Is just a lot. What are licensing expectations? Are you expecting us to restrain a kid while she is smoking marihuana? Kellee: These are allegations that we must investigate. If we substantiate, there will be discussion on what will be a proper intervention. David Harper: I understand. When can we expect Enrique to close these complaints? I commend myself for collaborating with the licensing and all counties. I called emailed for three weeks and get no response. I have a great relationship with CCL in Riverside. Is it okay if I contact them if I have any questions? Kellee: I rather you deal with us. There is a PIN out technical assistant mode. We are trying to offer more technical assistance for COVID situations. We have this meeting because we are getting closer to the provisional license expiration date and we want to see what is put in place to move forward. What happened to Jerome taking photos of staff in swimsuits? in the future if it was abuse, I would expect you to see his personal phone and verify that he has not taken photos from clients.

LPA met with Taylor Abernethy Program Manager and together the findings are discussed. The incident report alleged sexual assaultive behavior by Client #2 (C2) on Client #1 (C1). The incident was referred to Investigations Bureau, Investigator, Phillipe Ryan Miles. During the investigation, confidential interviews were conducted with C1, Staff #1 (S1), Program Director/Administrator, and assigned Social Worker for C2. The investigation also included review of corresponding facility Special Incident Report, contact with the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department and review of client and facility file history. Information revealed on February 22, 2021, C1 reported to Program Director/Facility Administrator that during an outing on February 18, 2021, C2 touched C1 inappropriately while in the facility vehicle. It was revealed that C2 squeezed C1's breast and at some point, digitally penetrated C1. Information obtained indicates S1 was inside of the Post Office at the time of the incident as S1 had left clients alone inside the vehicle. Witness account of the incident corroborate claims that C2 touched C1 inappropriately twice while alone and unattended in the facility vehicle. (Continued on page LIC809-C) Confidential interviews further revealed S1 was not aware of the incident between C1 and C2 until informed during a manager's meeting; after which, C1 and C2 were separated and placed in separate cottages. Supervision was elevated for client's safety. Facility Administrator admitted that staff failed to provide adequate care and supervision according to their facility policy. Investigator Miles' attempts to interview C2 were unsuccessful due to C2's AWOL status (absent without permission) after graduating facility's program. Based on the information obtained, there is enough evidence to support claim that Staff failed to ensure adequate supervision to clients C1 and C2 posing an immediate Health, Safety and Personal Rights risk to clients in care; therefore, the finding for neglect/lack of supervision is Substantiated. Facility is cited per California Code of Regulations, Title 22: 80078 (a) Responsibility for Providing Care and Supervision. Because this is a repeat violation of the same subsection within a 12-month period, an immediate civil penalty of $250 is assessed. A copy of this report, the Confidential Names List and appeal rights were provided to the Facility Administrator. (Continued on page LIC809-D)",

    "narrative": "The investigation revealed during a facility outing on May 8, 2021, S1 provided alcohol to clients C1 and C2. Confidential interviews revealed S1 gave C1 a mixed alcoholic drink which S1 provided to clients in a pink colored plastic bottle. C1 indicated that C1 \"got a buzz\" from the alcohol as a result. Witness statements remained consistent throughout the investigation process. S1 denied providing alcohol to the minors. Upon discovery of the incident, facility filed an incident report notifying required parties and conducted an internal investigation into the matter. It was also revealed during the same outing, S1 took out an unlit marijuana cigarette and put in S1's mouth \"jokingly\". Upon facility's discovery of S1's actions, S1 was place on suspension and later terminated from facility's program. According to witness statements and documentary evidence, S1 allowed C1 and C3, to use S1's cell phone to message through outside communications and/or post selfie. Evidence of C3's photo and/or messages was observed posted in social media. The investigation revealed that S1 knew C1, C2 and C3 were victims of Child Sex Trafficking; however, S1 allowed minors to use S1's cell phone to post messages and potentially communicate with sex traffickers. Based on confidential interviews and documentary evidence, the Department has determined the allegations that S1 provided alcohol to minors to consume and exposed minors to CSEC activity is Substantiated. Staff's actions poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care. The licensee is therefore issued a citation in accordance with the Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Program Interim Licensing Standards, Chapter 7.5, Version 3.1: 87065. Personnel Duties.

    "narrative": "Based on statements gathered and review of related documents including review of police report, facility incident report, and client's file, there is not enough evidence to support a lack of supervision resulted in C1's attempted hanging. Records reviewed revealed C1 had a history of self harming behavior and Hope Refuge had safety measures in place to help de-escalate C1. At the time of the incident on September 2, 2020, the facility was operating within approved staff to client ratios. C1 was assigned one to one supervision with a designated staff member. Staff members acted swiftly and appropriately to prevent C1 from harming self or any staff members. Based on statements gathered and review of related documents including review of police report, facility incident report, and client's file, there is not enough evidence to support a lack of supervision resulted in C1's attempted hanging. It was further reported that Staff are not properly trained and Staff are not meeting minor's needs. Information obtained during interviews and record review revealed that while staff members receive standard ongoing training including, but not limited to Pro-Act (Professional Assault Crisis Training) some staff members lack experience working with youth in current population resulting in high turnover and continual hiring of new staffs. Based on gathered information, the finding concerning above mentioned allegations are deemed Unsubstantiated at this time meaning, although the allegations may have happened or is valid, there is not a preponderance of the evidence to prove that a violation occurred. There were no deficiencies cited at this time. A copy of this report is emailed to Program Manager.",

The evidence revealed the county placement agency did not receive a notification from Hope Refuge about the incident of discovering three box cutters in the child's possession until after an inquiry was made. Based on confidential interviews and documentation reviewed through the course of this investigation, the Department has determined that the licensee has failed to prevent minor from having access to hazardous items while in care, did not prevent youth from self-harming, and failed to report the incident within the agency's next working day. In most cases staff are not aware incidents of self-harming have occurred, that items have been found that can be used for self-harm, etc. until a client has informed them. Staff's actions pose an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to children who are placed in care.

Barnes-Woodard conducted an unannounced complaint inspection for the purpose of delivering findings and met with Trina Garcia, Direct Care Staff. The report was amended to provide additional information regarding the complaint finding. During the investigation process, AGPA Woodard was unable to interview the staff who is the alleged perpetrator. The alleged perpetrator no longer works at the facility, and contact information is no longer valid. In interviews it was reported that staff was seen on the couch masturbating, and when seen, she stopped. In other interviews it was stated that a special incident report was written as well as an in-house investigation that was conducted by Facility Administrator. It was reported that a conversation was held with staff (alleged perpetrator) and staff denied it and stated she would never do anything like that; however client interviews were not conducted. AGPA requested a copy of the SIR and the in-house investigation, however after several requests, was never provided to AGPA. Based on confidential interviews with 12 staff members and four youth, AGPA Woodard determined that the allegation is unsubstantiated. An unsubstantiated finding means although the allegation may have happened, the preponderance of evidence does not prove it. UnsubstantiatedEstimated Days of Completion:",

Upon arrival, AGPA Woodard was greeted by Taylor Abernethy, Program Manager. During the course of the investigation, AGPA observed two out of three dryers out of service at time of inspection on June 5, 2021. Due to there being still one dryer available on the lower campus for use by clients, and if needed, there was one available dryer on the upper campus for use. During multiple inspections at the facility, AGPA did not observe any leaking fire hydrants or any not in working order. Although staff and clients feel the facility poses a fire hazard due to being located in a woodsy area, there was a maintenance man cutting back the dried brush. On occasion toiletries ran low on stock, staff and clients did not confer that toiletries were not provided. Although the facility has an evacuation plan, the majority of staff and clients were not aware of it, and drills were not being performed. Based on confidential interviews with relevant parties, and inspections conducted on various dates, AGPA Woodard determined that the allegations are unsubstantiated. An unsubstantiated finding means although the allegation may have happened, the preponderance of evidence does not prove it.

S1 denied providing C1 and C2 with alcohol; however, S1 admitted to stopping by S1's residence while transporting C1 and C2. Based on confidential interviews and corroborating evidence the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met. Information obtained remained consistent to prove S1 provided alcohol to minors, C1 and C2 while in care. The allegation is deemed substantiated which poses an immediate health, safety and personal rights risk of harm to children placed in care.
