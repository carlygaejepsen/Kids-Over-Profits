# Codebase Analysis Report

## Overview
- Repository: Kids-Over-Profits
- Date: 2025-10-14T23:06:09Z
- Summary: Conducted static syntax checks for PHP and Python scripts. PHP files passed linting. Two Python scripts initially contained unresolved merge conflict markers that prevented compilation, which have now been corrected.

## Commands Executed
1. `find Website -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l`
   - Result: PHP syntax check passed for all scanned files.
2. `python - <<'PY' ...` (iterates through `Scripts/*.py` using `compileall.compile_file`)
   - Result: Identified syntax failures caused by conflict markers in two Python scripts; all others compiled successfully.

## Identified Issues
| File | Issue | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Scripts/utah_citation_scraper.py` | Previously contained unresolved Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< ours`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> theirs`) at the top of the file, leading to `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. | Python compilation output: `*** Error compiling 'Scripts/utah_citation_scraper.py'... SyntaxError: invalid syntax` (resolved in Follow-Up Actions). |
| `Scripts/utah_citation_scraper.v3.py` | Previously contained identical merge conflict markers, producing the same syntax error. | Python compilation output: `*** Error compiling 'Scripts/utah_citation_scraper.v3.py'... SyntaxError: invalid syntax` (resolved in Follow-Up Actions). |

## Follow-Up Actions
- Merge conflicts in both `Scripts/utah_citation_scraper.py` and `Scripts/utah_citation_scraper.v3.py` have been resolved by consolidating the improved OCR-enabled data extraction workflow with robust file output handling.
- Added CSV export alongside JSON output so downstream spreadsheet processes remain supported while benefiting from the richer checklist parsing.
- Re-ran targeted Python compilation checks across the `Scripts` directory to verify that the scraper modules (and their compatibility wrapper) now parse without syntax errors.
- Recommend integrating these checks into an automated lint/test pipeline to prevent regression of merge conflicts or dependency drift.
